Abstract

A shared-decision making process that considers the patient's requests, the three-dimensional imagingbased diagnosis of the actual full-face deformity, and the risk-benefit profile of the existing surgical options could support the preoperative orthodontist-surgeon interaction when counseling patients and setting the surgical plan for maxillary repositioning. The difference between Western and Asian cultures regarding the aesthetic appeal of the zygomatic/malar region and facial profile should also be appraised.
