Abstract

Coronavirus disease 2019 has presented substantial challenges to patient care and impacted health care delivery, including cardiac electrophysiology practice throughout the globe. Based upon the undetermined course and regional variability of the pandemic, there is uncertainty as to how and when to resume and deliver electrophysiology services for arrhythmia patients. This joint document from representatives of the Heart Rhythm Society, American Heart Association, and American College of Cardiology seeks to provide guidance for clinicians and institutions reestablishing safe electrophysiological care. To achieve this aim, we address regional and local COVID-19 disease status, the role of viral screening and serologic testing, return-to-work considerations for exposed or infected health care workers, risk stratification and management strategies based on COVID-19 disease burden, institutional preparedness for resumption of elective procedures, patient preparation and communication, prioritization of procedures, and development of outpatient and periprocedural care pathways.KEYWORDS COVID-19; Cardiac electrophysiology; Arrhythmia management ABBREVIATIONS CIED = cardiac implantable electronic device; ECG = electrocardiography; EP = electrophysiology; HCW = health care workers; ICD = implantable cardioverter defibrillator; ICU = intensive care unit; PCR = polymerase chain reaction; PPE = personal protective equipment; PUI = person under investigation; TEE = transesophageal echocardiography Background
