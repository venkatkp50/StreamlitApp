Abstract

For the last 2 years, one of the most frequent causes of respiratory failure is coronavirus disease 2019 . The symptoms are not specific. Imaging diagnostics, especially high-resolution computed tomography, is a diagnostic method widely used in the diagnosis of this disease. It is important to emphasize that not only SARS-CoV-2 infection may manifest as interstitial pneumonia. Other diseases such as other viral, fungal, atypical bacterial pneumonia, autoimmune process, and even cancer can also manifest as ground-glass opacities or consolidations in the imaging of the lungs. In this case report, we described a patient who manifested many symptoms that seemed to be COVID-19. However, all performed antigen and polymerase chain reaction tests were negative. The diagnostics must have been extended. Microbiological and mycological blood cultures and sputum cultures were performed. Blood cultures were negative but in sputum, Candida albicans and Candida glabrata were identified. Targeted therapy with fluconazole was implemented with a satisfactory result. The patient was discharged from the hospital in a good general condition with no complaints.
