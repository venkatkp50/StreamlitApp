Abstract

Avian coronavirus (AvCoV) is a ubiquitous multiple-serotype pathogen of poultry, and its control is mainly based on the use of vaccines. We report here the previously unknown full genomes of the Ma5 (27,652 nucleotides [nt]) and BR-I (27,618 nt) AvCoV vaccine strains of the GI-1 (Massachusetts) and GI-11 (Brazil) types.
