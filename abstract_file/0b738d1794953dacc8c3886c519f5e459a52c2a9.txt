Abstract

The Covid-19 pandemic has intensified interest in animals with superior antiviral defences. I argue that the role of such animals in biomedical research contrasts with the role of disease models.Keywords Disease models · Non-model organisms · SARS-CoV-2Much biomedical research uses animal models to investigate human diseases. The Covid-19 pandemic shines a spotlight on a very different, and perplexing, way of employing animals in biomedical research: as medical toolkits rather than as models. This note sketches (what I will call) the toolkit strategy for using animals in biomedical research.As the examples below will show, some animals evolved antidisease strategies that are superior to those of humans. Consequently, some biomedical researchers aim to uncover the underpinning mechanisms and to determine whether the animals' strategies can be reproduced in humans. In this context, animals are employed like medical toolkits, i.e. collections of ready-to-use equipment and supplies for treating medical conditions. In contrast to disease models, toolkit organisms are investigated despite and because of the fact that their features are expected to be absent in humans.
