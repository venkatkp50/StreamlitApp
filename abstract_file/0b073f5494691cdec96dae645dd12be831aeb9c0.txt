Abstract

Background: In early 2020, Sars-Cov-2 was identified in China as a new coronavirus. Due to its transmission, Sars-Cov-2 has spread rapidly across the world. In the early stage of the disease outbreak, psychiatric symptoms have been reported, including depressive symptoms. In this study, we assessed the prevalence of depressive symptoms in quarantine and its association with sociodemographic variables and known protective factors for depression, such as spirituality, social support, resilience, and quality of life. Methods: A cross-sectional web-based questionnaire was distributed via social media. The instruments consisted of the 8-item EUROHIS-QOL, PHQ-9, Social Support Questionnaire, WHOQoL-SRPB, and CD-RISC. Results: A total of 3,274 participants were included in this study. 23.67% of the participants met the criteria for a depressive episode. Higher age, spirituality, social support, resiliency, and quality of life were associated with less depressive symptoms. Quarantine length; mental health treatment; chronic disease; age; sex; lower levels of spirituality, social support, resilience, quality of life, physical exercise, and education; and unpaid occupation were found to be predictors of depressive symptoms during COVID-19 quarantine. Limitations: The data are limited to the pandemic initial period, the sample isn't random and the use of selfreported questionnaires are some limitations of our study. Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in Brazil, quarantine time, treatment for mental health, chronic illness, lower levels of education, and unpaid occupation were positively associated with depressive symptoms. Age, sex, spirituality, social support, resilience, quality of life, and physical exercise showed a negative relationship with depressive symptoms.
