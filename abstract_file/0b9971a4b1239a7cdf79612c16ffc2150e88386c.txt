Main text : 2508 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Highlights  Knowledge of the extent of COVID-19 epidemic and the level of herd immunity is urgently needed;  High throughput serological screening assays are necessary to achieve that;  We develop a Multiplex bead-based IgG detection tool for pathogenic human coronaviruses;  The novel assay is highly sensitive and specific;  Our novel assay is more sensitive than a commercial EIA.  We show that an immunoassay using a single antigen can lead to false positive results.AbstractKnowledge of the COVID-19 epidemic extent and the level of herd immunity is urgently needed to help manage this pandemic.We used a panel of 167 samples (77 pre-epidemic and 90 COVID-19 seroconverters) and SARS-CoV1, SARS-CoV2 and MERS-CoV Spike and/or Nucleopcapsid (NC) proteins to develop a high throughput multiplex screening assay to detect IgG antibodies in human plasma. Assay performances were determined by ROC curves analysis. A subset of the COVID-19+ samples (n=36) were also tested by a commercial NC-based ELISA test and the results compared with those of the novel assay.On samples collected ≥14 days after symptoms onset, the accuracy of the assay is 100% (95% CI: 100-100) for the Spike antigen and 99.9% (95% CI:99.7-100) for NC. By logistic regression, we estimated that 50% of the patients have seroconverted at 5.7±1.6; 5.7±1.8 and 7.9±1.0 days after symptoms onset against Spike, NC or both antigens, respectively and all have seroconverted two weeks after symptoms onset. IgG titration in a subset of samples showed that early phase samples present lower IgG titers than those from later phase. IgG to J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f SARS-CoV2 NC cross-reacted at 100% with SARS-CoV1 NC. Twenty-nine of the 36 (80.5%) samples tested were positive by the commercial ELISA while 31/36 (86.1%) were positive by the novel assay.Our assay is highly sensitive and specific for the detection of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV2 proteins, suitable for high throughput epidemiological surveys. The novel assay is more sensitive than a commercial ELISA.
