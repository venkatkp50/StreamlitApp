Here we report the colorimetric detection of spike (S1) protein of SARS-CoV-2 based on excellent peroxidase-like activity of Au@Pt nanoparticles, with merits of rapidness, easy operation, and high sensitivity. The Au@Pt NPs were fabricated by a facile seed-mediated growth approach, in which spherical Au NPs were premade as seeds, followed by the Pt growth on Au seeds, producing uniform, monodispersed and porous Au@Pt core-shell NPs. The as-obtained Au@Pt NPs showed a remarkable enhancement in the peroxidase-mimic catalysis, which well abided by the typical Michaelis-Menten theory. The enhanced catalysis of Au@Pt NPs was ascribed to the porous nanostructure and formed electron-rich Pt shells, which enabled the catalytic pathway to switch from hydroxyl radical generation to electron transfer process. On a basis of these findings, a colorimetric assay of spike (S1) protein of SARS-CoV-2 was established, with a linear detection range of 10-100 ng mL -1 of protein concentration and a low limit of detection (LOD) of 11 ng mL -1 .The work presents a novel strategy for diagnosis of COVID-19 based on metallic nanozyme-catalysis.
