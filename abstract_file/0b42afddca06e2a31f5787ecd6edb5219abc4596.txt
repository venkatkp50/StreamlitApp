Abstract

To achieve intensive activity-based and goal-directed rehabilitation for unilateral cerebral palsy (UCP), several static and functional upper limb orthoses have been used but with limited robust evidence-base. The current pilot study evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of a customized 3D-printed orthotic device in children with UCP. The attainment of a prespecified goal and Shriners Hospital Upper Extremity Evaluation (SHUEE) at 3 and 6 mo were the efficacy measures. Of the 14 screened children, 5 (median age: 7.9 y; 3 boys) were included. The 3-mo follow-up could be completed for 3 children while 6-mo follow-up could be completed for 1 child. Rest could not be assessed due to pandemic restrictions. Although none attained set goals till the last follow-up, all 3 children (at 3-mo follow-up) showed improvement in SHUEE scores without any significant safety concerns. Further studies on 3D-printed orthosis in UCP are the need of the hour.
