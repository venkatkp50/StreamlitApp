Abstract

Alpacas develop diminished disease following bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) infection compared to cattle. We hypothesized that alpaca and bovine cells have differential permissiveness and responses to BVDV infection. To characterize alpaca testicular (AT) and bovine turbinate (BT) cells BVDV infection permissiveness, viral replication and interferon (IFN) synthesis was evaluated. BVDV replicated 3-4 logs lower in AT cells with diminished antigen deposition compared to BT cells. BVDV infection inhibited IFN response in both AT and BT cells. Compared to BT cells, BVDV-infected AT cells had a 2-5 fold increase in IFN synthesis following dsRNA stimulation. The greater IFN response of AT cells compared to BT cells following poly I:C stimulation with or without ncp BVDV infection, may be the basis for the decreased BVDV permissiveness of AT cells and may contribute to the clinical differences following BVDV infection of alpacas and cattle.
