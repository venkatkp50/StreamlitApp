Abstract

We present recent updates for determined directly from the standard model (SM) with lattice QCD inputs such asˆ, | |, | |, 0 , 2 , LD , , and . We find that the standard model with exclusive | | and other lattice QCD inputs describes only 66% of the experimental value of | | and does not explain its remaining 34%, which leads to a strong tension in | | at the 4.5 ∼ 3.7 level between the SM theory and experiment. We also find that this tension disappears when we use the inclusive value of | | obtained using the heavy quark expansion based on the QCD sum rule approach.
