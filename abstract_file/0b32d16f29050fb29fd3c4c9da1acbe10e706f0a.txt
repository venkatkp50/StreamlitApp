Abstract

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused interruptions to chronic disease and non-emergency treatment. The purpose of this study is to examine which socioeconomic status groups are most at risk of treatment interruption among Japanese workers. Methods: This cross-sectional internet monitor study was conducted among Japanese workers on December 22-26, 2020. Out of a total of 33 302 participants in the survey, 9510 (5392 males and 4118 females) who responded that they required regular treatment or hospital visits were included in the analysis. A multilevel logistic model nested in the prefecture of residence was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for treatment disruption. We examined separate multivariate models for socioeconomic factors, health factors, and lifestyle factors. Results: During a period of rapid COVID-19 infection, about 11% of Japanese workers who required regular treatment experienced interruptions to their treatment. The OR of treatment interruption associated with not being married compared with being married was 1.44 (95%CI: 1.17-1.76); manual labor work compared with desk work 2 of 10 | FUJIMOTO eT al.
