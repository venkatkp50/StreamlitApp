Abstract

Purpose: The aim of this study was to map changes in working and living conditions of Norwegian personal trainers (PTs) during the Covid-19 lockdown spring 2020.Methods: A total of 150 PTs (mean (SD) age 35.5 (8.4) years, with 6.5 (5.3) years of experience as PT, and 61% female) in Norway responded to an online survey.Results: Number of PT sessions per week was reduced during the lockdown and the majority of the respondents reported loss of clients and negative impact on their working conditions. The official restrictions and guidelines were considered difficult to interpret and somewhat discriminatory compared to restrictions and guidelines for other comparable exercise occupational groups. The lockdown period provided more PTs to offer online and outdoor training. Living conditions were also affected with reported impairments in private economy and reduced vitality (p < 0.05), and with vitality being lower in female compared to male respondents during, but not before, the lockdown period.Discussion: The reported negative impact of the Covid-19 lockdown period on PTs' working and living conditions are discussed with focus on the reported gender differences and considering the previously reported poor reputation of the fitness industry.
