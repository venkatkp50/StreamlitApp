Abstract

Background: Due to the covid-19 outbreak, social distancing measures were imposed to control the spread of the pandemic. However, isolation may affect negatively the psychological well-being and impair sleep quality. Our aim was to evaluate the sleep quality of respiratory patients during the covid-19 pandemic lockdown.
