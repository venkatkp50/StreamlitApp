Abstract

The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has had wide-reaching and unprecedented 5 impacts on the transport sector worldwide. At present, there is no globally agreed timeframe 6 for when this pandemic will end. The current and near-future potential impacts must be 7 addressed in a relatively comprehensive and seamless way. The present study proposed a 8 PASS (P: Prepare-Protect-Provide; A: Avoid-Adjust; S: Shift-Share; S: Substitute-Stop) 9 approach for policymaking that accounts for COVID-19 and future public health threats. The 10 PASS approach was illustrated conceptually, and then policy measures were recommended by 11 referring to the past and ongoing best practices. Policymaking challenges and research issues 12 were discussed.Das, 2020], and urban transport [EIT, 2020a,b]). However, scientifically sound methodologies 43 that are suitable for making policy decisions that can address the current COVID-19 and 44 future public health pandemics are lacking. Therefore, the present study conducted an initial 45 1 https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html [Accessed on September 2, 2020]J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 attempt at exploring how to make policy decisions that can address the current COVID-19 46 and future pandemics, in a relatively comprehensive and seamless manner, by reflecting on 47 the roles of governments, firms, and citizens.In the context of public health, Evans (1975) and Weinberger (1975) illustrated the 49 activities, responsibilities, and roles of local, state, and federal public health agencies, in terms 50 of effectiveness of the health care system, development of human resources, delivery of care 51 services, and promotion of research and development. Jochelson (2006) also emphasized the 52 use of taxation, bans, regulations, and education, whereas Cho (2017) further pointed out the 53 importance of preparedness capabilities for local governments. Adshead and Thorpe (2007) 54 suggested paying more attention to the key role of people in shaping society, roles of mass 55 media in driving forward the debate that creates the will for change, and the involvement of 56 society at large in promoting, protecting, and developing public health. During the COVID-19 57 pandemic, insufficient consideration paid to all stakeholders in decision making has resulted 58 in serious reputational and financial repercussions (De Longevialle and Wilkins, 2020). The 59 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (2014) stated that transportation 60 organizations are a part of pandemic planning and response system; they emphasized the roles 61 of these organizations in keeping proper and effective relationships with all stakeholders 62 (related to local public service agencies, emergency management, public health, suppliers and 63 vendors, and end users), via situational awareness and analysis, information sharing and 64 monitoring (e.g., rapid response to rumors), identification of essential transportation 65 functions, and participation in pandemic planning, as well as the resulting good decisions.66The transport sector has responded to the current pandemic in various ways, such as 67 shifting car production to make respirators, turning high-speed trains into rolling hospitals, 68 supporting medical professionals by grounding airline cabin crew with first-responder training, 69 offering free transport to patients and medical staff, and delivering food to vulnerable citizens 70 by taxis and ride-sharing services (Kim, 2020). In fighting against COVID-19 and future 71 pandemics, it is useful to group the transport sector by travel mode: airline, inter-city railway, 72 subway, streetcar, bus, taxi, and truck, and others. Transport services are run by firms, which 73 are either privately owned, government owned, or jointly owned based on public-private 74 partnership. In different countries, the relationships (observed via regulations, subsidies, and 75 supervision: e.g., public transport firms receive more subsidies in the USA and Europe than in 76 Japan [MLIT, Japan, 2014]) between transport firms and the government are not the same, 77 either. These differences have led to different impacts of COVID-19 on the transport sector 78 (EBP, 2020; European Commission, 2020a; Lawrence and Granath, 2020) and affected the 79 ways of pandemic management interventions (Our World Data, 2020; TUMI, 2020) across 80 countries. 81 Within each mode, governments, firms and citizens may have a different role in 82 addressing the issues of COVID-19 and future pandemics, although modes may overlap in 83 some cases. First, both freight and passenger transport may involve the use of two or more 84 modes from origin to destination. Second, transport is a derived demand from activity 85 participation (including both private and business/organization activities). In the case of 86 passenger transport, travel party and face-to-face communication intensity (number of 87 members meeting/gathering at destination, closeness between members, and duration of 88 meeting/gathering) at the destination are additional risk factors. Thus, infection risks in the 89 transport sector are multi-faceted because trip chaining, activity chaining, and interpersonal 90 interactions are involved. Interpersonal interactions indicate not only face-to-face 91 communication contacts but also decision-making interactions between persons (e.g., 92 employee and employer, school-age children and their parents, people conducting business 93 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Highlights Impacts of COVID-19 on the transport sector are targeted. A PASS approach was proposed for policymaking for addressing pandemics. Policy measures are recommended based on the PASS approach. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f
