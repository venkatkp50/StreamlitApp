Abstract

Purpose To compare sleeve gastrectomy (SG) to SG associated with Rossetti fundoplication (SG + RF) in terms of de novo gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) after surgery, weight loss, and postoperative complications. Materials and methods Patients affected by morbid obesity, without symptoms of GERD, who were never in therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), were randomized into two groups. One group underwent SG and the other SG + RF. The study was stopped on February 2020 due to the COVID pandemic. Results A total of 278 patients of the programmed number of 404 patients were enrolled (68.8%). De novo esophagitis was considered in those patients who had both pre-and postoperative gastroscopy (97/278, 34.9%). Two hundred fifty-one patients (90.3%) had completed clinical follow-up at 12 months. SG + RF resulted in an adequate weight loss, similar to classic SG at 12-month follow-up (%TWL = 35. 4 ± 7.2%) with a significantly better outcome in terms of GERD development. One year after surgery, PPIs were necessary in 4.3% SG + RF patients compared to 17.1% SG patients (p = 0.001). Esophagitis was present in 2.0% of SG + RF patients versus 23.4% SG patients (p = 0.002). The main complication after SG + RF was wrap perforation (4.3%), which improved with the surgeon's learning curve. Conclusion SG + RF seemed to be an effective alternative to classic SG in preventing de novo GERD. More studies are needed to establish that an adequate learning curve decreases the higher percentage of short-term complications in the SG + RF group.Keywords Rossetti sleeve · Nissen sleeve · GERD · Obesity Key points • Adding Rossetti fundoplication to sleeve reduces development of de novo GERD. • Patients undergoing sleeve + Rossetti fundoplication had an adequate weight loss. •Sleeve + Rossetti fundoplication is safe after an adequate learning curve.
