Abstract

To effectively control the spread of COVID-19, it is essential that all jurisdictions have the capacity to rapidly contact trace all close contacts of each and every case. We describe the early experience in the City and County of San Francisco, where contact tracing capability was rapidly expanded to respond to COVID-19. Important prerequisites to scale up included rapid expansion of the COVID-19 contact tracing workforce, a comprehensive training and onboarding program, and the institution of effective performance management metrics. The San Francisco model for contact tracing, including focusing on rigorous training, recruiting, and partnering with community-based organizations from diverse, affected communities, is an inclusive approach relevant to other jurisdictions and settings.
