Abstract

They regulate blood pressure and cardiovascular homeostasis. Pathogenic conditions associated with ETR dysfunctions include cancer and pulmonary hypertension. While both receptor groups are activated by their respective peptide agonists, pathogenic autoantibodies (auto-Abs) can also activate the AT 1 R and ET A R accompanied by respective clinical conditions. To date, the exact mechanisms and differences in binding and receptor-activation mediated by auto-Abs as opposed to endogenous ligands are not well understood. Further, several questions regarding signaling regulation in these receptors remain open. In the last decade, several receptor structures in the apo-and ligand-bound states were determined with protein X-ray crystallography using conventional synchrotrons or X-ray Free-Electron Lasers (XFEL). These inactive and active complexes provide detailed information on ligand binding, signal Frontiers in Endocrinology | www.frontiersin.org
