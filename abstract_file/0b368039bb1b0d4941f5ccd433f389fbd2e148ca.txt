Currently, due to many high-profiled benefits, clinical studies on Toujie Quwen granule (TJQW) have been increasing. The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of TJQW used with conventional western therapy for COVID-19.Methods: Relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were searched in Chinese and English databases, and the search time is January 2020 to May 2021.

According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, screening literature, extraction data will be conducted by 2 researchers independently. Statistical analysis will be conducted using the RevMan 5.3.5 software. After screening the literature based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, The Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system will be used to evaluate the quality of each result.Results: This study will provide the evidence for TJQW to be used with conventional western therapy for COVID-19.Conclusion: The efficacy and safety of TJQW used with conventional western therapy for COVID-19 will be assessed.
