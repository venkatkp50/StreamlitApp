Abstract

This article investigates and analyses the mass media and analytical (non-academic) reporting on the economic consequences of the Coronavirus. The collected sample of indicative works seeks to understand how the problem is framed as a crisis, with a focus on the identification of government policy and its consequences on the economy, and predictions concerning the longer-term effects and consequences for the economy.
