Abstract

was declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO) in January 2020. Various physical distancing interventions were introduced to flatten the epidemic curve and reduce the disease burden. We evaluated the impacts of policy stringency and residents' compliance on time-varying reproduction number in 17 countries.Data were from WHO reports of local transmission (Apple Maps' mobility trends reports. We estimated the daily time-varying reproduction number (Rt) by country. 0-, 7-and 14-day lagged effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions and changes in human mobility on Rt were estimated by linear mixedeffects models.Rt initially surged rapidly, then declined gradually depending on policy stringency. The highest mean policy stringency scores were for Italy (69.97) and South Korea (61.00). Variations in stringency scores were higher in Europe, the US and Australia than in Asia. The human mobility reduction was greater in countries with strict policies (median stringency score > = 50). In terms of immediate (0-day lag) effects, Rt reductions were found for workplace-closure, limited-gathering, and stay-at-home policies. At a 7-day lag, Rt reductions were found for workplace closure, restrictions on gatherings, stay-at-home requirements, international PLOS ONE
