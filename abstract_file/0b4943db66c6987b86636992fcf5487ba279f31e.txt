Abstract

In recent years, the sanitization of environments, devices, and objects has become mandatory to improve human and environmental safety, in addition to individual protection and prevention measures. International studies considered ozone one of the most useful and easy sanitization methods for indoor environments, especially hospital environments that require adequate levels of disinfection. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the microclimate influence on sanitizing procedure for indoor settings with ozone, to prevent infections and ensure the safe use of the environments. The concentration of ozone was measured during sanitization treatment and estimation of microorganisms' survival on the air and different contaminated plates after the sanitization operations were performed. The results demonstrated a significant reduction in the microbial count that always fell below the threshold value in different conditions of distance, temperature, and relative humidity.
