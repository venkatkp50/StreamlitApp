Abstract

Acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) is an unusual cutaneous reaction, most often related with a hypersensitivity reaction to commonly used drugs. It is characterized by an abrupt onset of a pustular rash within hours or days after drug exposure and usually resolves spontaneously within 1-2 weeks after drug discontinuation. Some cases associated with systemic involvement and shock have been reported. We present the case of a severe AGEP, manifesting in association with systemic involvement and haemodynamic instability resulting in shock and multiorgan dysfunction in an adult female patient diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. There were no identifiable associated drugs, and the patient was not initiated on antimalarial drugs. Our patient improved rapidly, both hemodynamically and dermatologically with no directed therapy.
