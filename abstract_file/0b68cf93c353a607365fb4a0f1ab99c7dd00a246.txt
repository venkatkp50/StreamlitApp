Abstract

Turkey, with rich tourism diversity and destinations, has experienced considerable changes in the tourism sector as one of the top ten most visited countries over two decades. Research shows that increasing mutual interaction and integration among countries and different cultures encourage visitors and contribute to tourism sector development. In this respect, in the light of available data, globalization performance in Turkey has been ongoing above the world average since 1970. On the other hand, the country has suffered terror attacks that are a significant deterrent factor for tourism. Hundreds of bombings and armed assaults occurred until very recently. However, empirical evidence on the role of terrorism and globalization in the tourism sector is not sufficient to clearly understand tourist behaviors and to provide new insights into the literature. Considering the probable effects of globalization and terrorism, Turkey is an excellent case to investigate tourism sector development within this framework. Therefore, this study aims to investigate how tourist arrivals to Turkey react to globalization level and terror attacks by using advanced time-series analysis covering the period 1980-2018. Results reveal that globalization and terrorism are essential determinants of tourist arrivals in Turkey.
