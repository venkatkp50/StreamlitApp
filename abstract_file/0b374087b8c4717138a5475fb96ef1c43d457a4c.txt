Abstract

Objectives: It has been suggested that rapid antigen detection assays (RADT) may 26 perform suboptimally in terms of sensitivity for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron 27 variant infection. To address this issue, we conducted a prospective study in primary 28 health centers to evaluate the clinical performance of the Panbio™ COVID-19 Ag 29Rapid Test Device in nasopharyngeal specimens (NP) carried out at the point of care. 30 Methods: We recruited 244 patients (median age, 40 years; range 2-96; 141 female) 31 with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 (232 adults and 12 children). 228/244 patients had 32 been fully vaccinated (two doses) with licensed COVID-19 vaccines prior to 33 recruitment. Most patients (222/244) were SARS-CoV-2 naïve prior to enrollment. 34 Patients were tested by RT-PCR and RADT within 5 days since symptoms onset. 35 Results: 126 patients (51.6%) tested positive by both RT-PCR and RADT, 90 patients 36 (36.8%) returned negative results by both assays and 28 patients (11.4%) yielded 37 discordant results (RT-PCR+/RADT-). No patients tested RT-PCR-/RADT+. Overall 38 specificity and sensitivity of RADT was 100% (95% CI, 95.9-100%) and 81.8% (95% 39 CI, 75-87.1%) respectively. The sensitivity of the assay increased from 79.6% (95% CI, 40 66.4-88.5) when considering specimens collected at days 0-1 after symptoms onset, to 41 86.4% (95% CI, 66.7-95.3) when grouping the specimens obtained on days 4-5. 42 : medRxiv preprint 104 and RADT and 90 patients (36.8%) returned negative results by both assays. In turn, 28 105 patients (11.4%) yielded discordant results (RT-PCR+/RADT-). No patients tested RT-106 PCR-/RADT+. Concordance between the results provided by the two assays was good 107 (κ, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.69-0.85). Importantly, time to specimen collection was comparable 108 (P=0.69) between RT-PCR+/RADT+ and RT-PCR+/RADT-patients (median 2 days; 109 range, 0-5). 110Overall specificity and sensitivity of RADT was 100% (95% CI, 95.9-100%) and 111 81.8% (95% CI, 75-87.1%) respectively. As shown in Table 1 , RADT assay sensitivity 112 increased in parallel with SARS-CoV-2 RNA load, reaching 95.6% in specimens with 113 viral loads ≥ 7.5 log10 copies/ml (C T , ≤ 20). Interestingly, the sensitivity of the assay 114 increased from 79.6% (95% CI, 66.4-88.5) when considering specimens collected at 115
