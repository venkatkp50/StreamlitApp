Abstract

Most cardiac arrhythmias at the whole heart level result from alteration of cell membrane ionic channels and intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca 2+ ] i ) cycling with emerging spatiotemporal behavior through tissue-level coupling. For example, dynamically induced spatial dispersion of action potential duration, QT prolongation, and alternans are clinical markers for arrhythmia susceptibility in regular and heart-failure patients that originate due to changes of the transmembrane voltage (V m ) and [Ca 2+ ] i . We present an optical-mapping methodology that permits simultaneous measurements of the V m -[Ca 2+ ] i signals using a single-camera without cross-talk, allowing quantitative characterization of favorable/adverse cell and tissue dynamical effects occurring from remodeling and/or drugs in heart failure. We demonstrate theoretically and experimentally in six different species the existence of a family of excitation wavelengths, we termed semasbestic, that give no change in signal for one dye, and thus can be used to record signals from another dye, guaranteeing zero cross-talk.
