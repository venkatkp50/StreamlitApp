Abstract

Health Care Leaders (HCLs) faced unprecedented challenges during the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Leaders played an important role in shaping the experiences of Health Care Workers (HCWs) during this time. However, research is needed on how HCWs experienced and characterized HCLs' response and support. The aim of our study was to examine HCWs' experiences with leadership and to identify aspects of HCLs' response that were effective in supporting HCWs in their roles during the early phases of the pandemic. This was a qualitative study based on open-ended semi-structured interviews conducted (June 1-July 18, 2020) with frontline HCWs during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Connecticut, USA. Participants (N = 45) included physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists and patient care assistants who worked in inpatient and outpatient settings in various specialties, roles and 3 health systems across Connecticut, USA during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were offered a $25 gift card as an incentive for participation. We used inductive techniques derived from grounded theory to develop themes. We identified 6 main themes related to leadership response and support of HCWs during the pandemic namely: 1) Effective communication and transparency; 2) Prioritizing their health and safety; 3) Employee scheduling considerations: autonomy, assignment support and respite; 4) Appreciation-financial and nonfinancial; 5) Showing up and listening and 6) Stepping up with resources. Our findings can inform leadership responses to future pandemics and other unanticipated crises leading to strengthening of the health care system as a whole.
