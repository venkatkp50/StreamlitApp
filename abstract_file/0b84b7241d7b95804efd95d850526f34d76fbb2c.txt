Introduction and Objectives: Myocardial performance may be impaired in cytokine-mediated immune reactions. The myocardial performance index (MPI) is a practical parameter that reflects systolic and diastolic cardiac function. We aimed to assess the MPI in patients with COVID-19.The study population consisted of 40 healthy controls and 40 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who had mild pneumonia and did not need intensive care treatment. All participants underwent echocardiographic examination. First, the MPI and laboratory parameters were compared between healthy controls and patients in the acute period of infection. Second, the MPI and laboratory parameters were compared between the acute infection period and after clinical recovery.: Compared with healthy controls, patients with COVID-19 had a significantly higher MPI (0.56±0.09 vs. 0.41±0.06, p<0.001), longer isovolumic relaxation time (IRT) (112.3±13.4 vs. 90.6±11.2 ms, p<0.001), longer deceleration time (DT) (182.1±30.6 vs. 160.8±42.7 ms, p=0.003), shorter ejection time (ET) (279.6±20.3 vs. 299.6±34.7 ms, p<0.001) and higher E/A ratio (1.53±0.7 vs. 1.21±0.3, p<0.001). Statistically significantly higher MPI (0.56±0.09 vs. 0.44±0.07, p<0.001), longer IRT (112.3±13.4 vs. 91.8±12.1 ms, p<0.001), longer DT (182.1±30.6 vs. 161.5±43.5 ms, p=0.003), shorter ET 279.6±20.3 vs. 298.8±36.8 ms, p<0.001) and higher E/A ratio (1.53±0.7 vs. 1.22±0.4, p<0.001) were observed during the acute infection period than after clinical recovery. Left ventricular ejection fraction was similar in the controls, during the acute infection period and after clinical recovery.
