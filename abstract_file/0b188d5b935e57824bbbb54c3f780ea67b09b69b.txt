Abstract

Globalization and the openness of the world in case of emergencies can lead to a collapse in many areas and, as a result, to an imbalance of economic systems. In such conditions, the education system should maintain stability, be sufficiently flexible in terms of teaching methods and technologies, as well as the management of processes. In the authors' opinion, the most effective tool to manage reactively the learning process as a complex system is a feedback. In order that teachers have a real opportunity to control the quality of this process, it is necessary to identify objective criteria for the assessment of quality in the context of the differentiation of motivational attributes. In addition, this way provides for teaching staff a possibility to evaluate the effectiveness of a particular method to influence on the motivational criteria. As a case study, different student's groups were selected to compare their involvement in the process with traditional and online forms of learning, their performance and the impact of the learning form on the projects quality prepared by students.
