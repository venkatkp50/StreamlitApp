Abstract

e present study especially concerns the investigation of the Couette flow and heat transfer with thermal radiation through an inclined channel. Single-wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT) and multiple-wall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) are nanoparticles embedded in the host fluid. e dimensionless highly nonlinear differential equations (DEs) are solved via numerical scheme bvp4c. e effects of the physical parameters on heat transfer are presented in the form of graphs. e results demonstrate that the heat transfer is enhanced by using solid particle frictions (SWCNT and MWCNT). e large estimation of a magnetic parameter declines the velocity component. e current and existing results with their comparisons are shown in the tabular form for the validation of our code. e current results are in good agreement with their existing results. Generally, fuzziness or uncertainty is inherent in modeling, analysis, and experimentation. Due to the uncertain environmental conditions, fuzziness broadly exists in various engineering heat transfer problems. In this work, the nanoparticles' volume fraction of the SWCNT and MWCNT is taken as uncertain parameters in terms of triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs). e TFNs are controlled by the α − cut which has less computational effort for analyzing the fuzziness or uncertainties. Also, a comparison between the SWCNT and MWCNT through the membership function and the variability of the uncertainty is studied.
