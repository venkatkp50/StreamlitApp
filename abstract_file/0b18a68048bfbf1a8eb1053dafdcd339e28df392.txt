Abstract

Introduction Spinal extradural arachnoid cysts (SEACs) are rare expansive lesions that account for~1% of all spinal tumors. They develop as the result of arachnoid membrane herniation through a small dural defect and are mostly reported to be located at lower thoracic region and thoracolumbar junction. Case presentation We report a rare case of SEAC located in the cervicothoracic junction causing neurologic compression. Discussion Only 3% of all SEACs are observed in the cervical spine. They are the most common in young men and present with compressive symptoms. SEACs have potential to enlarge. As they are surgically removable lesions, early and definite diagnosis is important in preventing clinical deterioration. MRI is recommended for the diagnosis and preoperative planning.
