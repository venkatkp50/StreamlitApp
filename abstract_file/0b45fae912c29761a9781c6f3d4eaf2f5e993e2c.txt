Abstract

Many newly published articles have focused on the association between COVID-19 and thrombogenicity. Indeed, it has become a frequently observed phenomena. In this study, we report on a 45-year-old man with a COVID-19-positive test. His dramatic progression started 5 days after admission. He developed a right ventricular (RV) thrombus (rare condition) and multiple brain sites infarction. We discuss this phenomena by showing the extent to which the thrombosis can take place, the possible relation between inflammatory, D-dimer and case progression and suggest a treatment approach particularly in cases with multiple thrombogenicity organ involvement.
