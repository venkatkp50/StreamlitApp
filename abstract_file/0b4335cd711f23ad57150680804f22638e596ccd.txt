Abstract

A web-based self-management intervention improved physical activity but not exercise capacity. There is a need to develop and study accessible self-management interventions for COPD. https://bit.ly/3iT1yvUCite this article as: Robinson SA, Cooper JA Jr, Goldstein RL, et al. A randomised trial of a web-based physical activity self-management intervention in COPD. ERJ Open Res 2021; 7: 00158-2021Abstract Improving exercise capacity is a primary objective in COPD. Declines in exercise capacity result in reduced physical activity and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Self-management interventions can teach patients skills and behaviours to manage their disease. Technology-mediated interventions have the potential to provide easily accessible support for disease self-management. We evaluated the effectiveness of a web-based self-management intervention, focused on physical activity promotion, on exercise capacity in COPD. This 6-month randomised controlled trial (NCT02099799) enrolled 153 persons with COPD at two US sites (VABoston, n=108; VABirmingham, n=45). Participants were allocated (1:1) to the webbased self-management intervention (physical activity promotion through personalised, progressive step-count goals, feedback, online COPD-related education and social support via an online community) or usual care. The primary outcome was exercise capacity (6-min walk distance (6 MWD)). Secondary outcomes included physical activity (daily steps per day), HRQoL (St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire Total Score), dyspnoea, COPD-related knowledge and social support. Change in step-count goals reflected intervention engagement. Participants' mean age was 69 (SD=7), and mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s % predicted was 61% (SD=21%). Change in 6MWD did not differ between groups. Intervention participants improved their mean daily step counts by 1312 more than those in the usual care group ( p<0.001). Groups did not differ on other secondary outcomes. VABirmingham participants were significantly more engaged with the intervention, although site did not modify the effect of the intervention on 6MWD or secondary outcomes. The intervention did not improve exercise capacity but improved physical activity at 6 months. Additional intervention modifications are needed to optimise its COPD self-management capabilities.
