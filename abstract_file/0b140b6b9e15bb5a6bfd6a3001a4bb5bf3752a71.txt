Abstract

Objective: To evaluate patient acceptability and bowel preparation efficacy of sodium picosulfate-magnesium citrate (PICOPREP) for colonoscopy. Methods: A questionnaire survey regarding the patient acceptability of bowel preparation agent PICOPREP was administered to 54 patients, and its efficacy was evaluated using the Ottawa Bowel Preparation Scale (OBPS). Results: Eighteen (33.3%) participants reported that PICOPREP is very easy to drink, 30 (55.5%) easy, four (7.4%) acceptable, one (1.9%) difficult, and one (1.9%) very difficult. The flavor was very good as reported by eight (14.8%) participants, good by 25 (46.3%), neutral by 20 (37.0%), bad by one (1.9%), and very bad by none. The number of patients who requested PICOPREP was 42 (77.7%), indicating its high acceptability. Evaluation of the OBPS score showed that the rectosigmoid colon had significantly better polyethylene glycol (PEG) scores than PICOPREP, but the entire colon did not show a significant difference between PICOPREP and PEG scores (1.09 ± 0.65 vs. 1.17 ± 0.76, p = 0.632 in the right colon; 0.48 ± 0.52 vs. 0.72 ± 0.66, p = 0.079 in the mid colon, 0.93 ± 0.49 vs. 0.63 ± 0.52, p = 0.012 in the rectosigmoid colon, and 3.28 ± 1.70 vs. 3.20 ± 1.90, p = 0.836 in the entire colon). Conclusion: PICOPREP is considered as one of the important options due to its good patient acceptability and high efficacy similar to PEG.Ottawa bowel preparation scale, patient acceptability, sodium picosulfate-magnesium citrate The incidence of colorectal cancer is increasing in Japan, with a high number of deaths in both men and women; however, it is widely known to be curable This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. if detected and treated at an early stage. 1 However, colorectal cancer has no subjective symptoms at an early stage. Therefore, colonoscopy is recommended for screening and early detection. 2 Still, the current colonoscopy consultation rate remains insufficient.
