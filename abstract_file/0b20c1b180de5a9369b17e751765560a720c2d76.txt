Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Abstract The current study aimed to examine the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on patientrelated delay with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) at a tertiary center in the United Kingdom. The study demonstrated a significant delay in symptom-to-first medical contact and a higher cardiac troponin-I level on admission in patients with STEMI during the COVID-19 pandemic versus the pre-COVID era.Journal Pre-proofData analysis was performed with SPSS, version 24.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, New York, USA). Categorical variables are summarized as numbers and percentages and compared using Pearson's χ 2 test. Continuous variables are presented as mean ± SD or median (interquartile range) and compared using Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney test as appropriate. Outliers were defined as any value which falls more than 1.5 times the IQR above the third quartile (75 th Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f percentile) or below the first quartile (25 th percentile). P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsA total of 139 patients were screened during the described time frames, 115 patients (COVID era n=46, pre-COVID era n=69) met our inclusion criteria and for whom full data were available. Twenty-four patients were excluded due to lack of symptom-to-FMC records (n=13), unclear symptom onset (n=5), lack of in-hospital echocardiography (n=4), or deferral of primary PCI due to severe frailty (n=2). The mean age was 64.9±11 years and approximately two third of the study cohort were men. The majority of patients in both groups (85%) presented through EMS. None of the patients in the COVID-19 era group had the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 infection by the time of their hospital discharge. The study groups were well balanced for various baseline characteristics (Table 1) .The delay in symptom-to-FMC was significantly longer in COVID era (227 [65-790] vs.119 min, P= 0.01) compared to pre-COVID era group (Figure 1a) .In the COVID-19 era, time from symptom to FMC was < 2 hours in 34.8%, 2 to <6 hours in 30.4%, 6 to <12 hours in 8.7 %, and > 12 hours in 26.1% of the cohort. The corresponding percentages in the pre-COVID-19 era were 50.7%, 34.8%, 14.5%, and 0% of the cohort, respectively.The cTn-I level on admission (normal: 14-47 ng/L) was also significantly higher in the COVID versus pre-
