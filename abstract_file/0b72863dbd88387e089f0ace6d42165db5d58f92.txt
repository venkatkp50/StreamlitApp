Abstract

Let us take warning from another's wound" -Saint Jerome, Letter 54, To Furia, AD394The role of the case report has evolved over time, reflecting the evolution of medicine itself. In ancient times, classical texts by physicians such as Hippocrates and Galen formed the basis of medical education. These reports, written with limited understanding of the underlying pathophysiology, provided a framework for the empirical treatment of disease.
