Abstract

Cancer patients in adolescents and young adults (AYA) generation aged 15-39 years have various psychosocial needs during their treatment course such as school enrollment, finding employment, marriage, and fertility. It is difficult for medical professionals to gain experience related to providing medical care and consultation support to these kinds of AYA generation cancer patients. There is a need to provide information and establish both support and medical care systems that are able to meet the diverse needs unique to this generation. This review will explain how to launch an AYA support team (AST). We have worked and established the AST since 2016, which is medical care teams that provide support according to the life stage of each individual patient and build a multidisciplinary AYA generation patient support system. The team-building process consisted of two main projects: building and enlarging multidisciplinary team and establishing screening process of psychosocial needs of AYA generation patients. Multidisciplinary healthcare professionals got involved in the AST with already-existing patient support functions in our center: the patient support center, which is an outpatient department and the palliative care team, which is an inpatient interdepartmental team. The AST systematically finds patients in need of assistance and offers them support as a multidisciplinary team. The AST also established a procedure that systematically gathers information about the needs of patients by using a screening tool. In addition, the AST provides the following specialized services: reproductive medicine, supporting cancer patients with children, employment support, and peer support. The AST has been established and sophisticatedly worked. It can flexibly provide various psychosocial support services. This review will explain how to launch an AST.
