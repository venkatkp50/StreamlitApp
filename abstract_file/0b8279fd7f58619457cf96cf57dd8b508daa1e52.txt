Abstract

In daily life, there are a variety of complex sound sources. It is important to effectively detect certain sounds in some situations. With the outbreak of COVID-19, it is necessary to distinguish the sound of coughing, to estimate suspected patients in the population. In this paper, we propose a method for cough recognition based on a Mel-spectrogram and a Convolutional Neural Network called the Cough Recognition Network (CRN), which can effectively distinguish cough sounds.
