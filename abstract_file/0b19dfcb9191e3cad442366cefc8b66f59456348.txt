Abstract

Background: The characteristics of human parainfluenza virus type 4 (hPIV4) infection are not thoroughly understood. We therefore clarified the characteristics of hPIV4 in Korea. Method: From January 2013 to December 2017, children admitted with respiratory tract infection at the Department of Pediatrics in Chung-Ang University Hospital were enrolled in the study. Nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens were obtained from patients and tested for hPIV types by multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. We retrospectively reviewed subject medical records, focusing on epidemiological and clinical characteristics. Results: Of the 12 423 NPA specimens, 8,406 were positive by multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for nine respiratory viruses, and 1,018 were positive for one of the four types of hPIV: 1,018 specimens led to the detection of 1,029 hPIVs; 3ss (31.3%) were positive for hPIV1, 120 (11.7%) were positive for hPIV2, 356 (34.6%) were positive for hPIV3, and 231 (22.4%) were positive for hPIV4. Of the hPIV-positive patients, the mean age was 2.3 years (range, 0.1-12.7 years), 225 (97.4%) had no underlying disease, and 178 (77.1%) had a fever with a duration of 4.1 AE 2.3 days and a peak temperature of 39.0 AE 0.7Â°C. The most common diagnosis in hPIV4 infection was pneumonia (44.2%), followed by bronchiolitis (26.0%) and upper respiratory tract infection (24.3%). Only 2.2% of patients were diagnosed with croup. Although the most prevalent overall type of hPIV was hPIV3, hPIV4 generally caused acute respiratory tract infection in summer and early fall in an irregular annual pattern. Conclusions: Human parainfluenza virus type 4 is an important common pathogen of respiratory tract infections in pediatric patients in Korea.
