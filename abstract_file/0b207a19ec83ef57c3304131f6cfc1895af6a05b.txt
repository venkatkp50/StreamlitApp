Abstract

Purpose: Modern image guided radiation therapy is dependent on information technology and data storage applications that, like any other digital technology, are at risk from cyberattacks. Owing to a recent escalation in cyberattacks affecting radiation therapy treatments, the American Society for Radiation Oncology's Advances in Radiation Oncology is inaugurating a new special manuscript category devoted to cybersecurity issues. Methods and Materials: We conducted a review of emerging cybersecurity threats and a literature review of cyberattacks that affected radiation oncology practices. Results: In the last 10 years, numerous attacks have led to an interruption of radiation therapy for thousands of patients, and some of these catastrophic incidents have been described as being worse than the coronavirus disease of 2019 impact on centers in New Zealand. Conclusions: Cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, making combatting these attacks more difficult for health care organizations and requiring a change in strategies, tactics, and culture around cyber security in health and radiation oncology. We recommend an assume breach mentality (threat-informed defense posture) and adopting a cloud-first and zero-trust security strategy. A reliance on computer-driven technology makes radiation oncology practices more vulnerable to cyberattacks. Health care providers should increase their resilience and cyber security maturity. The increase in the diversity of these attacks demands improved preparedness and collaboration between oncologic treatment centers both nationwide and internationally to protect patients.
