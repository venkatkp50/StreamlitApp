Abstract

medRxiv preprint Six-hundred and thirty-four symptomatic patients were followed by GPs. The overall mean age was 46.97 years (SD 20.05, range 0-92) and 57.73% were women. Of these, 244 patients (38.49%) were seropositive for IgM and/or IgG. : medRxiv preprint During the follow-up period, 27.13% of symptomatic patients attended the ED, 11.83% were hospitalized and about 2% died.Results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the OR for a positive test was significantly increased in patients who had fever (>38 o C), ageusia and contact with a patient diagnosed with COVID-19.The seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among asymptomatic individuals in the general population was lower than expected.Approximately 40% of the symptomatic patients followed by GPs during the peak months of the pandemic in Barcelona, were positive. Fever (>38 o C), anosmia, ageusia and contact with a patient diagnosed with COVID-19 were associated with a positive test result. Nausea, vomiting, n (%) 50 (20.49%) 45 (11.54%) 95 (14.98%) 0.002 Skin lesions, n (%) 23 (9.43%) 31 (7.95%) 54 (8.52%) 0.517 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.
