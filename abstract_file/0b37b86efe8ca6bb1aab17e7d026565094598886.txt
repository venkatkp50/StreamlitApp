Abstract

The survey was disseminated to 5,694 individuals and 507 complete surveys were obtained (response rate of 8.9%). Respondents indicated that they obtained the most useful information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic through professional associations and internet/online news resources. However, 30% of the orthodontists believed information regarding personal financial guidelines was lacking. Most respondents identified delayed treatment progress and temporary staff layoffs as the two most negative ramifications of mandated office closures. Approximately 93% of practices applied for and utilized some sort of stimulus funding offered through the CARES Act. Respondents indicated that the COVID-19 related office closures resulted in an average of 50% decrease in net revenue.The survey found that the COVID-19 pandemic had a broad and significant impact on patient care and financial aspects of US orthodontic practices in 2020. Though generally accepting of the federal and state recommendations, respondents appeared to desire more guidance during the early phase of the pandemic.
