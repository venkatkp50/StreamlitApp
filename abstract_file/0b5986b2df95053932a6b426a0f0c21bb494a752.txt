Abstract

Pyrrolotriazine 1 is an important precursor to remdesivir. Initial results toward an efficient synthesis are disclosed consisting of sequential cyanation, amination, and triazine formation beginning from pyrrole. This route makes use of highly abundant, commoditized raw material inputs. The yield of triazine was doubled from 31% to 59%, and the synthetic step count was reduced from 4 to 2. These efforts help to secure the remdesivir supply chain.
