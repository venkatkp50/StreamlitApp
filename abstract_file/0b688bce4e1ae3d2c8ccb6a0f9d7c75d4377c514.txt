Abstract

The authors analyze the SARS-CoV-2 infection course in Cyprus using two models: a compartmental model and a particle model. After fitting the model parameters using recorded infections up to July 15, they provide forecasts for the future. Their forecasts proved completely wrong with respect to the actual evolution of the epidemic. Already at the time of submission of the paper the cumulative numbers of infection had exceeded the upper bound of what the authors report in the figures of the paper. The inconsistency between their expectation and reality can be appreciated by looking at the reported infection and the range considered by the authors.Data from WHO on the SARS-CoV2 cumulative confirmed infection cases in Cyprus retrieved on January 6 2021 from https://covid19.who.int/region/euro/country/cy shown together with a rough estimate of the range considered by the authors in the submitted manuscript (green dotted line).
