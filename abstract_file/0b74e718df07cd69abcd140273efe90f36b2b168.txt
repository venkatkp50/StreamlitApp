Abstract

Psychological and psychosocial issues are one of the prime areas to be focused on in SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. However, those patients' mental, social, and emotional parts are still not being focused on while treating the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. Thus, we integrated both eastern and western medicine to discuss its impact on the mental and psychological issues of the patient. We treated a 52-year-old man who was infected with COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 and had a sign and symptoms of fever, sore throat, running nose, cough, and tiredness. The patient was treated with integrated medicine, where we combined both eastern and western medicine to treat all aspects of health, i.e., physical, mental, emotional, and social. With the intervention we applied, his health was getting better day by day, and on the 16th day, his SARS-CoV-2 came negative. In addition, his mental health was also much better than the initial days of intervention. The integrated medicine therapeutic strategy effectively treats COVID-19 patients in all dimensions of health.
