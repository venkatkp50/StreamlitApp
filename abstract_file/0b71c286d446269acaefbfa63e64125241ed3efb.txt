Following the initial description of the virus, a huge number of clinical studies and case reports have been published which were supplemented by some basic research reports. Unfortunately, HBoV research still relies on clinical studies and case reports with accompanying cell culture studies as the major source of information on HBoV biology, as so far no animal model has been identified.
