Abstract

Background: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-COV2) depends on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) enzyme complex for its genomic replications and thus can be inhibited by nucleoside analogues. An example is Remdesivir, which is a non-obligate chain terminator of RdRp. Therefore, we investigate the activities of Remdesivir against COVID-19. Method: This is a systematic-review and meta-analysis of the literature on the effectiveness of Remdesivir in the management of COVID-19 through MEDLINE (
