(which was not certified by peer review) Abstract 1 To allow a return to a pre-COVID-19 lifestyle, virtually every country has initiated a 2 vaccination program to mitigate severe disease burden and control transmission; over 3 3.6 billion vaccine doses have been administered as of July 2021. However, it remains 4 to be seen whether herd immunity will be within reach of these programs, especially 5 as more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge. To address this 6 question, we developed a data-driven model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission for 7 Shanghai, China, a population with low prior immunity from natural infection. We 8 found that extending the vaccination program to individuals aged 3-17 years plays a 9 key role to reach herd immunity for the original SARS-CoV-2 lineages. With a 10 vaccine efficacy 74% against infection, vaccine-induced herd immunity would require 11 coverages of 93% or higher. Herd immunity for new variants, such as Alpha or Delta, 12 can only be achieved with more efficacious vaccines and coverages above 80-90%. A 13 continuation of the current pace of vaccination in China would reach 72% coverage 14 by September 2021; although this program would fail to reach herd immunity it 15 would reduce deaths by 95-100% in case of an outbreak. Efforts should be taken to 16increase population's confidence and willingness to be vaccinated and to guarantee 17 highly efficacious vaccines against more transmissible variants of concern. . ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.23.21261013 doi: medRxiv preprint 108 2021 for strategy 1, 2, and 3, respectively (Fig. 1G-I) .
