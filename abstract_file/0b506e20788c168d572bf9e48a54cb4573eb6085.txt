Abstract

Serotonin is a critical monoamine neurotransmitter molecule stored and released from enterochromaffin (EC) cells into the gut submucosa, transmitting the vomiting signal to the brain. We studied one mechanism by which vomiting is induced in pigs infected with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) by characterization of swine EC cells by immunohistochemistry. Conventional or gnotobiotic (Gn) 9-day-old pigs [PEDV-inoculated (n = 12); Mock (n = 14)] were inoculated orally (8.9-9.2 log 10 genomic equivalents/pig) with PEDV PC21A strain or mock. This is the first identification of serotonin-positive EC cells in swine by immunohistochemistry and mainly in intestinal crypts, regardless of infection status. They were morphologically triangular-shaped or round cells with or without apical cytoplasmic extensions, respectively. At post-inoculation hour (PIH) 16 or 24, when vomiting was first or frequently observed, respectively, PEDV infection resulted in significantly reduced numbers of serotonin-positive EC cells in duodenum, mid-jejunum, ileum, or colon. However, two of three PEDV-inoculated Gn pigs that did not yet show vomiting at PIH 16 had numbers of serotonin-positive EC cells in duodenum, ileum and colon similar to those in the negative controls. These findings suggest that serotonin release from EC cells (increased serotonin levels) into the gut submucosa might occur early PEDV post-infection to stimulate the vagal afferent neurons, followed by vomiting. Serotonin might be involved in the mechanisms related to vomiting in PEDV-infected piglets. We also found that mid-jejunum was the primary site of acute PEDV infection, and that systemic innate and pro-inflammatory cytokine responses were induced during the acute stage of PEDV infection.
