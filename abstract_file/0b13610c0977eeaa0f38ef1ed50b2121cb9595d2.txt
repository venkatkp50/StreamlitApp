Abstract

Background: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a deadly pandemic in the 21st century, resulting in many deaths, economic loss, and international immobility. Vaccination represents the only mechanism to defeat this virus. Several intramuscular vaccines have been approved and are currently used worldwide.Main body: However, global mass vaccination has not been achieved owing to several limitations, including the need for expertise to administer the injectionbased vaccine, improper distribution of the vaccine, and lack of cold chain facilities, particularly in resource-poor, low-income countries. Mucosal vaccines are typically administered either orally or nasally, and several studies have shown promising results for developing these vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 that might serve as viable alternatives to current vaccines. SARS-CoV-2 invades the human body via oral and nasal mucosal surfaces; thus, an oral or nasal vaccine can trigger the immune system to inhibit the virus at the mucosal level, preventing further transmission via a strong mucosal and systematic immune response. Although several approaches toward developing a mucosal vaccine are currently being tested, additional attention is required.Conclusion: In this article, the current approaches used to develop effective oral and nasal mucosal vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and their benefits, prospects, and challenges have been summarized.Immun Inflamm Dis. 2022;10:e604.wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/iid3 |
