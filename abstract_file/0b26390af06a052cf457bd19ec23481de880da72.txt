Abstract

The interplay between viral respiratory infections and cardiovascular disease has been most comprehensively researched using seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses as case studies. Here, we summarize the latest international observational research and clinical trials that examined the association between influenza, influenza vaccines, and cardiovascular disease, while contextualizing their findings within those of landmark studies. Recent Findings Most recent observational literature found that one in eight adults hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza infection experienced an acute cardiovascular event. The latest meta-analysis of the cardioprotective effects of influenza vaccine found a 25% reduced risk of all-cause death. There are four large cardiovascular outcome trials assessing the cardioprotective effects of different influenza vaccine strategies. Among these, the INVESTED study showed there is no significant difference between the high-dose trivalent and standard-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccines in reducing allcause mortality or cardiopulmonary hospitalizations in a high-risk patient group with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Summary Persons with cardiovascular disease represent a high priority group for viral vaccines; hence, using robust evidence to increase vaccine confidence among patients and practitioners is integral as we prepare for a possible influenza resurgence in the coming years.
