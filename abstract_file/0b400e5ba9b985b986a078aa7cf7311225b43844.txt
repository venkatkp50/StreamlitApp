Abstract

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has severely impacted health systems, economic and social progress globally in 2020. The rollout of vaccines in several parts of the world is being hailed as a solution to the crisis. With newer and more virulent serotypes on the horizon and limited vaccine available, evaluation of safety and immunogenicity is critical for rationalization of vaccine use in public health.
