Abstract

Over the last decades, the use of phylogenetic methods in the study of emerging infectious diseases has gained considerable traction in public health. Particularly, the integration of phylogenetic analyses with the understanding of the pathogen dynamics at the population level has provided powerful tools for epidemiological surveillance systems. In the same way, the development of statistical methods and theory, as well as improvement of computational efficiency for evolutionary analysis, has expanded the use of these tools for vaccine and antiviral development. Today with the Coronavirus Disease 2019 , this seems to be critical. In this article, we discuss how the application of phylodynamic analysis can improve the understanding of current pandemic dynamics as well as the design, selection, and evaluation of vaccine candidates and antivirals.ARTICLE HISTORY
