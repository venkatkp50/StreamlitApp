Abstract

We hypothesized that an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol for patients undergoing female pelvic reconstructive surgery would conserve hospital resources without compromising patient safety. Methods In June 2020, an ERAS protocol designed to promote same-day discharge was initiated that included pre-operative hydration, a urinary anesthetic, non-narcotic analgesia, perineal ice, a bowel regimen, enrollment of the family to assist with care, and communication regarding planned same-day discharge. We compared demographic, operative, hospital stay, complications, and cost data in patients undergoing pelvic organ prolapse or incontinence surgery over 4 sequential months pre (PRE; N = 82) and post (POST; N = 91) ERAS implementation using univariate statistics. Results There were no differences in demographics, operative details, or complications (p > 0.05). There were no significant differences in overall revenues or expenses (p > 0.05), but bed unit cost was significantly lower in the POST group ($210 vs $533, p < 0.0001). There was a trend toward an increased operating margin in POST patients ($4,554 vs $2,151, p = 0.1163). Significantly more POST surgeries were performed in an ambulatory setting (73.6% vs 48.8%, p = 0.0008) and resulted in same-day discharge (80.2% vs 50.0%, p = 0.0003). There were no differences in the rates of emergency room or unexpected clinic visits (p > 0.05). Prescribed post-operative opiate dose was significantly reduced in POST patients (p < 0.0001). Conclusions In patients undergoing female pelvic reconstructive surgery, an ERAS protocol facilitated transfer of procedures to an ambulatory surgical site and permitted same-day discharge without increasing complications, clinic visits, or emergency room visits. It also reduced bed unit cost and may improve operating margins.Publisher's note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.
