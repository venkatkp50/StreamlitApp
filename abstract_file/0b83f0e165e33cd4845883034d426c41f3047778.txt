Abstract

We present an asymptomatic 70-year-old man referred for an 18 F-FDG PET/CT for initial staging of a Hodgkin lymphoma. 18 F-FDG PET/CT showed bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy (stage II). Incidentally, the CT demonstrated bilateral ground-glass opacities with low-grade 18 F-FDG activity. CT findings were suspicious for COVID-19 pneumonitis.
