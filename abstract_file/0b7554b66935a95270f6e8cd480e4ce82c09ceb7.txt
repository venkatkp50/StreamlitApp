Abstract

UK; the common in infections to be explored are all regularly monitored conditions within the network. ï‚· A limitation of the study is that a validated case definition of AA is not available for primary care databases; this will be mitigated by additional analysis to explore the sensitivity of findings when non-specific alopecia diagnostic codes (e.g. unspecified alopecia) are included.on the quality of infections recording the quality of recording of these infection events higher in this network than other data sources.An ontological approach to detecting cases of AA and associated comorbidities will improve accuracy compared to the use of diagnostic codes alone.(69) Exclusion of individuals with potentially confounding conditions (i.e. other causes of hair loss) will also improve the accuracy of our estimates. The algorithms used to detect common mental health conditions have been previously validated in UK primary care. The completeness of GP data coding for prescriptions, referrals and issue of Med 3 certificates will ensure that our findings on AA and comorbidity management are robust and reliable, and the "episode typing" functionality of the RCGP RSC database will ensure incident and prevalent cases are appropriately assigned. The RCGP RSC database has been shown to be a representative sample of
