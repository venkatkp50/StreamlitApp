Abstract

The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein presents a surface with enormous membrane binding potential to host tissues and organelles of infected cells. Its exposed trimeric head binds not only the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), but also host phospholipids which are missing from all existing structures. Hence, the membrane interaction surfaces that mediate viral fusion, entry, assembly and egress remain unclear. Here the spike:membrane docking sites are identified based on membrane optimal docking area (MODA) analysis of 3D structures of spike proteins in closed and open conformations at endocytic and neutral pH levels as well as ligand complexes. This reveals multiple membrane binding sites in the closed spike head that together prefer convex membranes and are modulated by pH, fatty acids and post-translational modifications including glycosylation. The exposure of the various membrane interaction sites adjusts upon domain repositioning within the trimer, allowing formation of intermediate bilayer complexes that lead to the prefusion state while also enabling ACE2 receptor recognition. In contrast, all antibodies that target the spike head would block the membrane docking process that precedes ACE2 recognition. Together this illuminates the engagements of the spike protein with plasma, endocytic, ER or exocytic vesicle membranes that help to drive the cycle of viral infection, and offers novel sites for intervention.
