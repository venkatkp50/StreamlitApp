Abstract

Breast cancer (BC) is the most diagnosed and second leading cause of death among women worldwide. Elevated levels of lipids have been reported in BC patients. On the other hand, lipids play an important role in coronavirus infections including the newly emerged disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and designated COVID-19 by WHO. Cancer patients including BC have been reported to be at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is mostly attributed to the chronic immunosuppressive status of cancer patients along with the use of cytotoxic drugs. Here in this review, we highlighted the role of dyslipidemia associated with BC patients in the incidence and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Elevated levels of lipids namely phospholipids, cholesterol, sphingolipids, and eicosanoids in the serum of BC patients and their relocalization to the alveolar spaces can increase susceptibility and/or severity due to SARA-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, manipulation of dyslipidemia in BC patients should be recommended as prophylactic and therapy against SARS-CoV-2 infection.
