Abstract

Longitudinal serum samples and nasopharyngeal/nasal swab samples were collected from forty-eight individuals (median age 66yrs) with Covid-19 PCR-positive test results at Link√∂ping University Hospital. Samples were collected from initial visit and for 6 months follow up. Presence of serum IgG and IgA against SARS-CoV-2 antigens (S1-spike, nucleocapsid and NSP3) were analyzed. Nasal swabs were tested for presence of IgA against the outer envelope S1 spike protein. Ninety-two percent of participants were seropositive against SARS-CoV-2 recombinant proteins at day 28 from study entry and all (100%) were seropositive from samples collected at 2 months or later. The most common antibody responses (both serum IgG, mainly IgG1 and IgA) were detected against the S1-spike protein and the nucleoprotein. In samples collected from nasal tissues considerably lower frequencies of IgA-positive reactivities were detected. Sixteen to 18 percent of study participants showed detectable IgA levels in nasal samples, except at day 60 when 36% of tested individuals showed presence of IgA against the S1-spike protein. The study suggests that the absolute majority of studied naturally infected Covid-19 patient in the Linkoping, Ostergotland health region develop over 6 months lasting detectable levels of serum IgG and IgA responses towards the SARS-CoV-2 S1-spike protein as well as against the nucleoprotein, but not against the non-structural protein 3.
