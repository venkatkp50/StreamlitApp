Abstract

Natural products provide a rich source of potential antimicrobials for use in treating infectious diseases for which drug resistance has emerged. Foremost among these is tuberculosis.Assessment of the antimycobacterial activity of nargenicin, a natural product that targets the replicative DNA polymerase of Staphylococcus aureus, revealed that it is a bactericidal genotoxin that induces a DNA damage response in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and inhibits growth by blocking the replicative DNA polymerase, DnaE1. Cryo-electron microscopy revealed that binding of nargenicin to Mtb DnaE1 requires the DNA substrate such that nargenicin is wedged between the terminal base pair and the polymerase and occupies the position of both the incoming nucleotide and templating base. Comparative analysis across three bacterial species suggests that the activity of nargenicin is partly attributable to the DNA binding affinity of the replicative polymerase. This work has laid the foundation for target-led drug discovery efforts focused on Mtb DnaE1.Antimicrobial drug discovery, cryo-electron microscopy, DnaE1, DNA damage, DNA polymerase, DNA replication, DNA damage, drug resistance, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium smegmatis, nargenicin discoveries involving natural products have added impetus to exploring this target further: firstly, griselimycin, a cyclic depsipeptide discovered more than 50 years ago, was shown to bind with high affinity and selectivity to the -clamp (DnaN) at the site of interaction with DNA polymerase and other DNA metabolizing enzymes (Kling et al., 2015) . During DNA replication, the -clamp interacts with DnaE1, the replicative DNA polymerase termed variously DnaE, DnaE1, or PolC in different bacteria, greatly enhancing the processivity of the polymerase. Griselimycin interferes with the protein interaction between DnaE1 and the βclamp affecting the processivity of DNA replication (Kling et al., 2015) . The mechanistic novelty of griselimycin led to the development of the analogue, cyclohexyl-griselimycin, which has improved potency and stability, and demonstrated comparable efficacy to rifampicin when used in combination with first-line drugs in a mouse infection model (Kling et al., 2015) .Secondly, studies in Staphylococcus aureus identified the replicative DNA polymerase, DnaE, as the target of nargenicin A1 (referred to here as nargenicin) (Painter et al., 2015) , which belongs to a class of partially saturated alicyclic polyketides comprising an octalin ring ( Figure
