Abstract

COVID-19 is a new pandemic disease that is affecting almost every country with a negative impact on social life and economic activities. The number of infected and deceased patients continues to increase globally. Mathematical models can help in developing better strategies to contain a pandemic. Considering multiple measures taken by African governments and challenging socio-economic factors, simple models cannot fit the data. We studied the dynamical evolution of COVID-19 in selected African countries. We estimated a time-dependent reproduction number, R 0 for each country studied to offer further insights into the spread of COVID-19 in Africa. We found that at the beginning the pandemic, R 0 ≤ 4 for all the countries studied; three months later, R 0 ∼ 1 with fluctuations in-between.
