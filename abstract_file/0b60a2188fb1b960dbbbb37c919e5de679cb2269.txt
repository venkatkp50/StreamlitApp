Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 Abstract We study the variation of tropospheric NO 2 vertical column densities (TropNO 2 VCDs) over East China during the 2005-2020 lunar new year (LNY) holiday seasons to understand factors on the reduction of tropospheric NO 2 during the outbreak of COVID-19 in East China using Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) observations. TropNO 2 VCDs from OMI and TROPOMI reveal sharp reductions of 33%-72% during 2020 LNY holiday season and the co-occurring outbreak of COVID-19 relative to the climatological mean of 2005-2019 LNY holiday seasons, and 22%-67% relative to the 2019 LNY holiday season. These reductions of TropNO 2 VCD occur majorly over highly polluted metropolitan areas with condensed industrial and transportation emission sources. COVID-19 control measures including lockdowns and shelter-in-place regulations are the primary reason for these tropospheric NO 2 reductions over most areas of East China in 2020 LNY holiday season relative to the 2019 LNY holiday season, as COVID-19 control measures may explain ~87%-90% of tropospheric NO 2 reduction in Wuhan as well as ~62%-89% in Beijing, Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and Pearl River Delta (PRD) areas. The clean air regulation of China also contributes significantly to reductions of tropospheric NO 2 simultaneously and is the primary factor in the Sichuan Basin area, by explaining ~56%-62% of the tropospheric NO 2 reduction there. Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2020; Earth Observatory NASA, 2020; Lian et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020). Meanwhile, the outbreak of COVID-19 happened during the 2020 lunar new year (LNY) holiday season (a.k.a. spring festival) as the 2020 LNY's day was January 25, 2020 based on the lunar calendar. The LNY holiday season in China usually lasts for approximately 40 days and is herein defined as 14 days before the LNY's day and 25 days after (Figure 1). During the LNY holiday season, the tropospheric NO 2 abundance indicates "holiday effects" over China that are characterized by two high peaks before/after the national LNY holiday and a trough in the middle. This pattern shifts with the LNY's day on the Julian calendar (Tan et al., 2009; Zhang et Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 4 al., 2019; more in section 2.1). The COVID-19 lockdown in China started on January 23, 2020 and lasted through the entire 2020 LNY holiday season. As a result, studies on tropospheric NO 2 variation during the outbreak of COVID-19 shall take account of the impacts of LNY holiday seasons and shifts of LNY days on the Julian calendar every year (Liu et al., 2020). Also, China has begun to conduct new emission regulations since 2010, after which tropospheric NO 2 has been decreasing rapidly nation-wide (de Foy et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2016). These clean air regulations may also contribute to the observed tropospheric NO 2 reduction during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China. Significant reduction in tropospheric NO 2 vertical column densities (TropNO 2 VCDs) was observed by satellite instruments during the COVID-19 lockdown period (Bauwens et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020), which may be caused by a combination of "holiday effects" of LNY, meteorological conditions, control measures and lockdowns due to the COVID-19 outbreak, and the continuation of clean air regulations for clean air in China. The LNY "holiday effects" of TropNO 2 VCDs can be canceled out in this study since this study only focuses TropNO 2 VCDs over LNY holiday seasons. The meteorological influences on tropospheric NO 2 should be small in this study because meteorological conditions were normal in 2020 LNY holiday seasons compared to the 2005-2019 climatology, and 40-day average TropNO 2 VCDs smooth out most weather induced variability(European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2020; more discussions in Section 4.2). As such, the goal of this study is to understand the variation of TropNO 2 VCDs in East China during the 2005-2020 LNY holiday seasons and quantify contributions by both COVID-19 control measures and clean air regulations to the reduction of TropNO 2 VCDs during 2020 LNY holiday season in East China. We combine tropospheric NO 2 observations from Ozone Journal Pre-proof temperature, no lighting and inactive biosphere (Lin, 2012). The dominant contributor to NO2 variation is anthropogenic emission that shifts with the lunar calendar. As a result, studies on tropospheric NO 2 variation during the outbreak of COVID-19 shall take account of the impacts of LNY holiday seasons and shifts of LNY days on the Julian calendar every year. Journal Pre-proof developed by the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute and based on the NO 2 DOMINO(Dutch OMI NO2) algorithm with significant improvements. TROPOMI measures tropospheric NO 2 with a pixel size of 7 km Ã— 3.5 km at nadir, and the resolution has been improved to 5.5 kmPlain. The regression slope between OMI and TROPOMI level 3 data is 1.71 (Figure 2 (e)). A similar overestimate of OMI on tropospheric NO 2 over TROPOMI was also found over China in January 2019 (Cheng et al., 2019). These discrepancies may be caused by many factors, Journal Pre-proof measures-air-quality-derived-satellite-observations (accessed 6.1.20). European Space Agency, 2018.
