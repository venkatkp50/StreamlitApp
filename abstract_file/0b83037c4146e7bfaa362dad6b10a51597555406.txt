Abstract

It is vital to adhere to the prescribed public health measures in order to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and prevent a second wave with potential disruptive national lockdowns. Asymptomatic infected are estimated to be around a third of the official data, but their real number can be much higher if the individuals with one or two minor symptoms are included. The results emphasise the need for coordinated control measures that account for the interactions among different regions in Italy, and potentially among the countries in Europe.None.2
