Abstract

Doctors need to wear complete protective equipment when large numbers of patients flood into the emergency room. Taiwan has so far managed to prevent a large scale community outbreak, city forces wearing face masks on public transportation, and keep social distancing to stem the virus from spreading. The protective device may be contaminated and must be replaced. In the situation of limited resources, how to take care of the physiological needs of the doctor without increasing the chance of contamination during replacement is a consideration. By reducing the chance of contamination during removal and storage, the previous designs were analyzed and improved. We proposed three improved designs to reduce the contact. Design-A features a mask with a water channel that allows the user to remain hydrated without removing the cover. Design-B has a folding pattern that hides the outer surface. Design-C combines the mask with the brim of a cap which form an extended air-intake area. Through understanding the problem, related product began distribute on the market, Design-D extend the mask usages period with less contact.Contributions: Fang Lin Chao proposed design questions, guide brainstorming, model, and organize manuscripts.Funding: None.
