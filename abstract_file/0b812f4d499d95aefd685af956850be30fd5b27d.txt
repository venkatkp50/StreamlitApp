Abstract

To control the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus , China imposed rigorous restrictions, which resulted in great reductions in pollutant emissions. This study examines the characteristics of air pollutants, including PM 2.5 (particles with aerodynamic diameters < 2.5 mm), gas pollutants, watersoluble ions (WSIs), black carbon (BC) and elements, as well as the source apportionment of PM 2.5 in Suzhou before, during and after the Chinese New Year (CNY) holiday of 2020 (when China was under an unprecedented state of lockdown to restrict the COVID-19 outbreak). Compared to those before CNY, PM 2.5 , BC, SNA (sulfate, nitrate and ammonium), other ions, elements, and NO 2 and CO mass concentrations decreased by 9.9%e64.0% during CNY. The lockdown policy had strong (weak) effects on the diurnal variations in aerosol chemical compositions (gas pollutants). Compared to those before CNY, source concentrations and contributions of vehicle exhaust during CNY decreased by 72.9% and 21.7%, respectively. In contrast, increased contributions from coal combustion and industry were observed during CNY, which were recorded to be 2.9 and 1.7 times higher than those before CNY, respectively. This study highlights that the lockdown policy that was imposed in Suzhou during CNY not only reduced the mass concentrations of air pollutants but also modified their diurnal variations and the source contributions of PM 2.5 , which revealed the complex responses of PM 2.5 sources to the rare, low emissions of anthropogenic pollutants that occurred during the COVID-19 lockdown.
