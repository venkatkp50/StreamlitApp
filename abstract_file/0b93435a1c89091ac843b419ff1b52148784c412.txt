Abstract

This paper is an introductory to the special thematic session "Web Accessibility Observatories". The presented papers in this session tackle different dimensions of accessibility evaluation from different perspectives e.g. user requirements elicitation for large scale evaluation of websites, using meta data of digital artefacts such as chatbots to assess their accessibility, physical versus digital accessibility and tools to evaluate easy language on websites. Holistic web accessibility evaluation is a complex task that requires powerful cloud infrastructure to cope with the huge amount of data produced during the evaluation process according to legal frameworks.
