1 Abstract 18 T and B cell repertoires constitute the foundation of adaptive immunity. Adaptive immune 19 receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq) is a common approach to study immune system 20 dynamics. Understanding the genetic factors influencing the composition and dynamics 21 of these repertoires is of major scientific and clinical importance. The chromosomal loci 22 2 Introduction 39 The immune system's success in fighting countless evolving pathogens depends on a dy-40 namic and diverse set of B and T cell receptors. Due to the longevity of immunological 41 memory, high throughput sequencing of adaptive immune receptor repertoires (AIRR-seq) 42 provides detailed insights into the past and present encounters of the human immune sys-43 tem [21]. It can teach us about fundamental immune processes and reveal dysregulation, 44 with broad implications for biomedicine. B and T cell receptors are assembled during differ-45 entiation of hematopoietic stem cells, by a complex process involving somatic recombination 46 of a large number of germline-encoded V, D, and J gene segments, along with junctional di-47 versity that is added at the boundaries where these segments are joined together [40]. This 48 V(D)J recombination process creates a diverse repertoire of receptors that together with the 49 innate immune system form the first line of defense against pathogens. 50 Genetic factors are expected to influence the structure and functionality of AIRRs [23, 51 52]. However, understanding these genetic effects is confounded by lack of knowledge 52 about the population genetics of the TCR and BCR encoding genomic loci, and the special 53 challenges involved in describing the germline gene set of any individual [9]. The lack of 54 knowledge about these loci is due to difficulties in reliably mapping repetitive elements and 55 undocumented structural variations with short read sequencing. Many TCR genes were 56 reported in the decade after their first discovery [25]. Complete sequences of the TCR 57 encoding loci were reported in 1985 [24, 70, 61], and this led to the development of the TCR 58 encoding genes nomenclature by the ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT) group [30]. Since then, very 59 few allelic variants have been entered into the IMGT reference directories of germline genes. 60 In fact no new allelic variants of the TCR variable region genes have been named this century 61 despite published studies suggesting that the IMGT TCR reference directory may be far from 62 complete [33, 35, 60]. 63Until recently, there has been a similar lack of attention paid to the documentation of 64 BCR encoding loci, because the direct genomic sequencing of these loci is also very chal-65 lenging [66, 16]. This changed, both with a method for targeted long-read direct sequenc-66 ing of the BCR heavy chain encoding locus [49], and with the realisation that BCR encod-67 ing undocumented germline alleles and genotypes can be reliably inferred from AIRR-seq 68 data [10, 19, 17, 47], as well as haplotypes [28, 45], and chromosomal deletions within the 69 BCR encoding loci [22]. Even though TCR V(D)J gene rearrangements are generated by 70 analogous mechanisms to BCR rearrangements, to date there is no published data about 71 TCR germline allele inference and structural variation in the TCR encoding loci. Recently, 72there were attempts to extract BCR and TCR encoding allelic information from short read 73 whole genome sequencing data [72, 27, 33] , but these approaches were not validated with 74 targeted sequencing or AIRR-seq, and therefore are subject to criticism regarding the relia-75 bility of the inferences [65, 9]. Hence, to study genomic variations in TCR encoding loci and 76 their relations to the expressed repertoires, there is a need to adapt BCR inference tools to 77 TCR data. 78 In T cells, due to lack of somatic mutations, most studies sequence only a small fraction 79 of the variable region. AIRR-seq data can be generated by methods that differ in the length 80 of their coverage of V(D)J sequences. 5' RACE amplifies the whole V(D)J region from the 81 3' end of the J region to the 5' end of the mRNA molecule. BIOMED-2 primers [62] amplify 82 partial VDJ sequences from the J gene to the framework-2 (FR2) of the V gene, while the 83 Adaptive Biotechnologies [48] approach generates only 87 nucleotides from a fixed posi-84 tion within each TRBJ gene in FR4, and includes the complementary determining region 85 3 (CDR3) and a fraction of the TRBV gene from FR3. As there are TRBV alleles that are 86identical to other TRBV alleles for varying lengths from their 3' ends, it can be impossible to 87 2 unambiguously identify the gene and allele source of these partial V(D)J sequences. Thus, 88 the development of a TRBV genotype inference method requires the thorough documenta-89 tion of any gene pairs that can be impossible to distinguish for a given sequencing approach. 90 Here, we adapt a B cell inference pipeline to TRB AIRR-seq data (Fig. 1a) , to work 91 with these three types of sequencing approaches (Fig. 1b) , and infer undocumented alleles, 92 single and double chromosome deletions, genotypes, and haplotypes. The pipeline was 93 adapted to deal with the gene assignment ambiguity problem, which is especially important 94 in the analysis of data-sets of partial sequences (Fig. 1c-d) . This is an even greater problem 95 in data-sets of partial sequences (Fig. 1c-d) . We applied this pipeline to four of the largest 96 AIRR-seq data-sets currently available and revealed a rich picture of germline variability, and 97 a demonstration of how a single nucleotide polymorphism dramatically affects the composi-98 tion of the whole repertoire. These results may have important implications to TCR based 99 immunotherapy and disease diagnosis. 100 3 3 Results 101 102 To explore allelic variation in the TRBV locus, we inferred the sets of alleles carried for 103 each expressed TRBV gene in many individuals (personal genotypes). For this, we took a 104 multi step approach, in which we first assigned each sequence to the most likely allele(s) 105 using IgBLAST [69] with a reference panel of all the documented TRBV alleles as they 106 appear in IMGT [30]. Then, we used IgDiscover [10] to detect candidate sequences that 107 have not previously been documented in IMGT. Hereafter, we will refer to such sequences 108 as "undocumented alleles". Following this step, we re-ran IgBLAST [69] with an extended 109 reference germline sequence set that includes the candidates for undocumented alleles. 110 Finally, we inferred the personal genotype of each gene and individual using TIgGER [20]. To 111 ensure our confidence in the inference of undocumented alleles, we took steps that reduce 112 the influence of sequencing errors. First, we inspected the allele usage within the data-set 113 140Another genomic variation we explored in DS1 is in the 5' UTR. Consensuses of the 5' 141 UTR were constructed as previously described in Mikocziova et al. [38, 39]. We compared 142 the consensus sequences to the upstream regions, that include leader 1 (L-PART1), leader 143 2 (L-PART2), and the upstream leader 1 sequence (Supp . Table 1) , and found 31 undoc-144 umented upstream sequences. The L-PART1 and L-PART2 of 10 of these sequences are 145 absent from IMGT, and the L-PART1 of TRBV10-3*02 is also absent from IMGT (Supp. Ta-146 ble 2). Four out of the 11 L-PART1 absent sequences and six out of the 10 L-PART2 absent 147 sequences were also observed in long-read assemblies (Supp. Table 2 ). Two sequence 148 5 variations were observed in L-PART2, both were associated with TRBV13*01 and were also 149 observed in the long-read assemblies. In L-PART1, we found 15 sequence variations from 14 150 different alleles, 13 of them were also observed in the long-read assemblies. In addition, we 151 found four alternative splicing sequences from three different alleles. The first two are from 152 clusters of TRBV23-1, an ORF gene that lacks a functional splice donor site [36]. As a re-153 sult, the 5'UTR consensus sequence of TRBV23-1*01 contains an intron between L-PART1 154 and L-PART2. Both consensus sequences differ from the previously reported upstream se-155 quence by the number of copies of the TTTTG motif (Supp. Fig. 7) . The other two alternative 156 splicing variants were found upstream of the TRBV7-7 alleles. Here, both the documented 157 492 493 494 4.7 Gene usage comparison 495 The differences in gene usage between groups were analyzed using a two-tailed Mann-496
