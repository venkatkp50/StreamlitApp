Abstract

Background. Deformed wing virus (DWV) is a virulent virus that causes honeybee disease. DWV can exist as a latent infection in honeybees, outbreak into epidemics, and cause serious damage to beekeeping cross the world, including Vietnam. Methods. The two DWV strains circulating in Vietnamese honeybee, Apis cerana, were first isolated from adult honeybees in North Vietnam (DWV-NVN) and South Vietnam (DWV-SVN). Their complete nucleotide sequences were determined, aligned, and compared with other DWV strains. Results. The two Vietnamese DWV strains comprised 10,113 bp and contained a large single open reading frame (ORF) of 2,893 amino acids, initiating at nucleotide 1,130 and terminating at nucleotide 9,812. Multiple nucleotide sequence alignment between these two DWV-VN strains and DWV strains in A. mellifera was performed. The DWV-VN strains showed a low genetic identity (from 91.4% to 92.0%) with almost of these strains, but lower identities (89.2% and 89.4%) with UK2 and (89.6%) with the China2 strain. Low identities (91.7% and 91.9%) were also observed between the China3 strain (in A. cerana) and the DWV-VN strains, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequence alignment showed high genetic similarities (97.0%-97.9%) when the USA1, Chile, and China3 strains were compared to the DWV-VN strains. This ratio was 96.7% and 96.8% when the Korea1 strain was compared to the DWV-SVN and DWV-NVN strains, respectively. Numerous amino acid substitutions were identified in the L, VP3, and RdRp sequences. Notably, we observed six substitutions positioned at amino acids 27 (E > I), 98 (S > T), 120 (A > V), 153 (M > T), 170 (D > F), and 174 (Y > F) in the L protein, two amino acid changes at positions 980 (S > A) and 1032 (E > T) in VP3, and one amino acid change at position 2627 (R > C) unique to the DWV-VN strains. Phylogenetic analysis based on complete genome sequences, RdRp sequences and Simplot analysis indicated that there was a significant difference between DWV-VN strains in A. cerana and DWV How to cite this article Thu HT, Lien NTK, Lanh PT, Duong BTT, Hoa NT, Phuoc MH, Thai PH, Quyen DV. 2020. Genome analysis and phylogenetic characterization of two deformed wing virus strains from Apis cerana in Vietnam. PeerJ 8:e9911 http://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.9911 strains in A. mellifera. The results suggested that the genetic variations of the DWV-VN strains in A. cerana help them to adapt geographical conditions and may lead to change the viral pathogenicity of DWV-VN strains.
