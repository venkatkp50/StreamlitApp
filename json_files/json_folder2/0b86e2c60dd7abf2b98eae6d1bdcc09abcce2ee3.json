The aim of this study was thus two-fold: clarify the differential effects of short versus long-term presenteeism and corroborate the mediating effect of effort exertion on the relationship between presenteeism and workrelated outcomes. We adopt a three-wave panel design and measure all the variables at three different points (initially, after one week and after one year) to understand the effects of presenteeism over time. Our sample consists of 361 Chinese employees working in diverse industries in Taiwan. We analyze the panel data using structural equation modeling and bootstrapping. Our results reveal that presenteeism is positively associated with increased effort, work engagement, and job performance after one week. By contrast, presenteeism is negatively associated with job performance and work engagement though positively associated with emotional exhaustion after one-year. Our research contributes to clarify paradoxical results regarding presenteeism's consequences, as well as corroborating that effort exertion mediates the relationship between presenteeism and work outcomes. We also identify practical implications for organizations managing employees working remotely, a more common reality with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ensuing lockdowns and digitalization which has started to become the norm for a significant proportion of working sectors. Finally, we suggest recommendations for future research on presenteeism.",

            "text": "Presenteeism, defined as working while ill (Johns, 2010) , has a wide range of consequences for people and organizations; however, research regarding presenteeism in various disciplines has yielded inconsistent results (Ruhle et al., 2020) . Longitudinal research conducted over one year has revealed a strong, negative relationship between presenteeism and personal well-being (Skagen and Collins, 2016) as well as job performance (Leijten et al., 2014) . However, a systematic review of cross-sectional presenteeism studies revealed negligible or nonsignificant relationships between presenteeism and performance ratings (Lohaus and Habermann, 2019 Research over shorter intervals has also revealed positive relationships between presenteeism and job performance (3-month interval; Lu et al., 2013) and mental health (2-month interval; Lu et al., 2014) . These inconclusive results in presenteeism research call for further exploration on the consequences of presenteeism over time (Skagen and Collins, 2016) . Furthermore, a theory that could potentially explain the uneven findings when considering short or long-term presenteeism research is missing. In recent theoretical contributions, presenteeism is viewed as a neutral act, without positive or negative valence (Ruhle et al., 2020) . Therefore, this research aims to shed light on these contradictory results by applying the cognitive activation theory of stress (CATS; Ursin and Eriksen, 2004) and the conservation of resources theory (COR; Hobfoll and Wells, 1998) and by reviewing empirical evidence regarding presenteeism behavior over two time spans (one week and one year). We thus aim to achieve a more nuanced understanding of \"bad presenteeism\" (Lu et al., 2013; Cooper and Lu, 2016) .",

            "text": "Research regarding the effects of presenteeism has primarily focused on predicting work-related outcomes, such as job performance and emotional exhaustion (Skagen and Collins, 2016) . These outcomes are thought to be influenced by \"effort exertion. \" Hockey (1993) highlighted the concept of effort exertion which other research has applied to link work behaviors to related outcomes (Brown and Leigh, 1996; Hockey, 1997) . Overall, there are few studies in the organizational behavior field regarding effort exertion mechanisms (Yeo and Neal, 2004) . The effects of the effort exerted at work and the time over which such effort is exerted are often overlooked when describing personal and organizational outcomes. Therefore, drawing on CATS and COR theories, we predict that effort exertion at work is a key underlying psychological mechanism to understand whether presenteeism leads to two distinct circumstances, namely, increased or decreased performance over different time spans. Figure 1 depicts our conceptual research model. This research makes three valuable contributions to the presenteeism field. First, based on the CATS and the COR theories and our multiple follow-up research design, we shed light on the conflicting results regarding presenteeism and we hypothesize and test a temporal presenteeism model with short and long-term effects (one week and one year) on personal well-being and organizational effectiveness. Second, by incorporating the effort exertion construct as a key mediator, we establish a process model of presenteeism -effort exertionhealth/behavioral outcomes to increase our understanding of how the neutral act of presenteeism is translated into future outcomes over various timespans. Finally, presenteeism behavior, although widely scrutinized in Western literature, is considered a key virtue in the Confucian cultural context (Chinese Culture Connection, 1987) , emphasizing values such as hard work, diligence, and perseverance (Bond, 1988) . The Chinese work culture is thus an ideal context to examine the generalizability of Western presenteeism research and to further explore the psychological mechanisms that explain the paradoxical short and long-term outcomes of presenteeism.",

            "text": "Inspired by a recent review across disciplines (Ruhle et al., 2020) that cautioned against overgeneralizing the negative effects of presenteeism behavior, we considered presenteeism to be an act without positive or negative valence. We thus avoided obscuring the possible positive effects of this behavior. Although presenteeism has long been conceived as a counterproductive work behavior (Aronsson and Gustafsson, 2005 ) that reduces employee well-being and organizational effectiveness over the long term, for example, 1.5 years (Demerouti et al., 2009 ) and 2 years (Conway et al., 2014; Gustafsson and Marklund, 2014) , recent research has suggested that the negative effects of presenteeism in terms of productivity loss and on personal and organizational outcomes have been overstated (Johns, 2012; Cooper and Lu, 2019; Ruhle et al., 2020) . For example, Lu et al. (2014) found no lasting effects of presenteeism on mental health, physical health, or burnout over a two-month interval. Another study adopted a three-month interval and found no evidence of long-lasting or damaging effects on productivity or job performance (Lu et al., 2013) . Due to these inconclusive findings, recent research has suggested that presenteeism can also be considered an adaptive coping strategy for individuals and may increase short-term job performance without damaging personal health (Karanika-Murray and . We propose that the length of time that workers adopt presenteeism behavior should be considered to examine its effects on personal well-being and organizational effectiveness. This approach is consistent with Skagen and Collins' suggestion (2016) that future research on presenteeism should consider timeframes to understand the long-term consequences of presenteeism. Thus, to help explain the different outcomes of presenteeism over different time spans, we apply CATS theory (Ursin and Eriksen, 2004) .",

CATS explains the effects of the expectation of stress in determining personal and organizational outcomes; these expectations are demand-control (resource) expectancy and effort-reward expectancy. CATS also incorporates a time perspective and explains the effects of stressors over different time intervals by including the time expectancy of a stressor. In fact, the basic assumptions of CATS theory (Ursin and Eriksen, 2004) are that stressors are normal and healthy stimuli and that the stress response is necessary. Corroborating work by Hockey (1993 Hockey ( , 1997 , which highlights the importance of considering the biological context of behaviors in explaining human behavior, CATS theory maintains that, if an individual expects a stressor will be resolved within a short time, the stress response is simply an increase in stimulation without any detrimental health effects. However, if stressors persist for longer than the expected time, stress can contribute to negative health outcomes.",

Researchers have thus far conceived displaying presenteeism behavior as comparable to exerting intensive effort. Specifically, working through illness instead of taking sick leave has been seen as the amount of effort expended in work-related tasks (Miraglia and Johns, 2016) . However, overt behaviors like presenteeism may require or encourage employees to dedicate extra effort to work, though they are distinct concepts. Although presenteeism can result in dedicated effort, people with a suboptimal physiological condition may be psychologically absent and thus exert limited effort while working. Unlike the observable act of presenteeism, effort exertion is not immediately visible (Kanfer, 1990) .

COR theory postulates that individuals confronted with resourcedepleting circumstances adopt behaviors to preserve their remaining resources. Research has consistently shown that resource-depleting scenarios (such as working long hours or working through illness) cause further losses such as poor long-term performance and engagement (Lu and Chou, 2020) . Employees who are chronically subject to these resource-depleting circumstances, although they exert effort and allocate their limited resources to their work, still prioritize retaining their personal resources to compensate for their suboptimal situations. However, applying limited energy resources for constant overwork while feeling ill or exhausted not only negatively affects physiological and psychological functions but also personal well-being (Skagen and Collins, 2016) . Accordingly, people with diminished resources experience high levels of emotional exhaustion (McGregor et al., 2016) and are likely to have difficulties in continuing to exert additional efforts at work, stay engaged, and maintain high levels of performance (H4).

To facilitate the recruiting process, we provided students with a recruitment ad which articulated the study purpose. Eligible study participants were individuals with fulltime jobs. In the ad, we encouraged participation by offering a monetary incentive; we ensured that participants who completed the three survey waves would receive a compensation of NT $150 (approximately US $5). Students then posted the ad in a number of chat groups in Line. They also asked their peers to help further spread the ad. Interested participants contacted the corresponding author via Line by scanning a QR code in the ad, later receiving an informed consent form. In the latter, we again assured them that their participation was voluntary and that their responses would be confidential. We re-approached participants again in one week, as well as 12 months after their initial participation. We sent follow-up reminders to participants who did not complete the survey within 2 days after receiving it.",

Following their approach, we estimated three models: (1) Model 1: a null measurement model, (2) Model 2: multifactor measurement model with the proposed latent constructs, and (3) Model 3: measurement model with an additional method factor. If a common method effect existed, Model 3 would fit the data significantly better than Model 2. Then we would need to determine the amount of variance in the model contributed by the single method factor. To do that, we computed the average variance extracted (AVE) for the latent constructs against the method factor. It has been argued that, to rule out the presence of pervasive method variance, the variance explained by the method factor should be less than 25% of the total variance (Williams et al., 1989) . The results demonstrated that: Model 1 [\u03c7 2 = 3328, p < 0.001, \u03c7 2 /df = 27.09, Tucker-Lewis index, TLI = 0.56, CFI = 0.42, RMSEA = 0.17]; Model 2 [\u03c7 2 = 1112, p < 0.001, \u03c7 2 /df = 2.39, TLI = 0.91, CFI = 0.91, RMSEA = 0.05]; Model 3 [\u03c7 2 = 2269.11, p < 0.01, \u03c7 2 /df = 21.03, TLI = 0.51, CFI = 0.61, RMSEA = 0.15].

The aim of this study was two-fold: shed light on the inconsistent results of previous presenteeism studies by investigating its short and long-term effects and understand the psychological mechanisms transforming neutral presenteeism behavior into positive or negative outcomes. In accordance with recent cross-discipline reviews (Ruhle et al., 2020) , we consider effort exertion to be the underlying mechanism for presenteeism's effects. We test a process-based model, namely, the presenteeism-effort exertion-outcomes linkage, to analyze the relationship between overt presenteeism behavior and distinct outcomes.

Some scholars have documented the beneficial effects of taking time off during non-work time (e.g., not thinking about work after regular working hours) on future personal well-being and organizational outcomes.

In addition, in a five-wave follow-up study, Meier and Cho (2019) found that switching-off psychologically after work can decrease the negative impact of work stressors on family relationships, in particular, the relationship with partners.

Lu and Chou (2017) have applied social cognitive theory (Bandura, 1997) to explain Chinese self-efficacy in displaying presenteeism behavior. The internalized Confucian cultural norms regarding both hard work and diligence as well as the social relatedness and interpersonal harmony of Chinese employees may function as push-and-pull factors for personal decisions regarding time commitments at work. However, such behavior harms employee performance and well-being over time. Therefore, organizations must attempt to decrease these practices to prevent the \"accumulative consequences on downstream health\" (Johns, 2010, p. 533 ).",

This viewpoint provides implications for organizations and individuals given current trends regarding the adoption of digital practices and the increased virtualization of work, processes which the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated. Thereby, employees may also continue to work during illness or return to work too soon, as they do not want to let down their managers and colleagues because they believe that their fellow employees do not consider them sufficiently unwell to take time off (Hayes et al., 2020) . Research regarding the impacts of presenteeism by employees with infectious conditions has found that people frequently continue to work while experiencing contagious flu-like symptoms, raising particularly serious public health concerns given the current pandemic (Webster et al., 2019) . Therefore, organizational practices should consider that those who have contracted a fairly \"mild\" case of COVID-19 might return to work while experiencing symptoms such as chronic fatigue and cognitive difficulties several months later; this, in turn, could damage individual well-being, vigor, and organizational effectiveness over the long-term.",
