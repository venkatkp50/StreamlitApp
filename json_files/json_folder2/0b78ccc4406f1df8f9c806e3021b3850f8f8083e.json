            "text": "Background: The Drug Quality and Security Act passed in 2013 created a new voluntary category of compounders, referred to as outsourcing facilities. The regulatory landscape allows these facilities to compound on a larger scale in comparison with the typical compounding pharmacies, which positions them to potentially serve a role in overcoming drug shortages. Objective: The purpose of this article is to identify the number of drug products on shortage as reported by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that were also compounded by outsourcing facilities. Methods: All current and resolved drug shortages through January 27, 2020, as reported by FDA, were compared with the 503B product reports from July 2018 through June 2019 submitted to FDA by outsourcing facilities. The active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and dosage form for each product on shortage were compared with the 503B product reports to identify similarities. Results: There were 344 unique APIs on the FDA drug shortage list and 774 unique APIs on the 503B product reports. After comparison of the APIs on the drug shortage list with those on the product reports, 27% of unique APIs (74 of 272) were included on both lists, and of these, 18% (50 of 272) of the APIs on the drug shortage list were compounded by outsourcing facilities in the same dosage form as what was on shortage. Conclusion: The regulatory landscape positions outsourcing facilities to play an important role in providing access to medications while on shortage. However, when comparing the drugs on shortage as reported by FDA with the 503B product reports, there was minimal overlap. Additional research into why outsourcing facilities are not taking on a larger role in overcoming drug shortages should be explored.",

            "text": "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines a drug shortage as \"a period of time when the demand for the drug within the United States exceeds the supply of the drug.\" 1 There are various reasons that may lead to a drug being on shortage, with manufacturing issues, production delays, and issues surrounding the raw materials needed to manufacture the product being the most common. 2 In 2018, at the request of senators and members of the House of Representatives, FDA convened an interagency Drug Shortages Task Force to study the problem, determine the root cause of drug shortages, and to make recommendations for solutions. 3 This task force identified 3 major causes of drug shortages: lack of incentives to produce less profitable drugs, the market does not recognize and reward manufacturers for mature quality management systems, and logistical and regulatory challenges that make it difficult for the market to recover after a disruption. 3 Drugs on shortage are typically sterile injectable products or those in which a generic product is commercially available. 3 The peak of the drug shortage crisis was in 2011 when more than 250 shortages were reported to FDA. 4 Although the number of new drug shortages has decreased since then, there has been an increase in the number of drugs on shortage, and the shortages are lasting longer than in the past. 3 Drug shortages have had a major impact on the drug supply chain and patient access to medications. In 2017, the Institute for Safe Medication Practices surveyed pharmacy directors, Disclosures: The author has 2 grants funded by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to evaluate the use of bulk drug substances nominated for use in compounding by outsourcing facilities as outlined in the Drug Quality and Security Act.

From the nearly 300 respondents, 71% reported that they were unable to provide patients with the recommended drug or treatment. This resulted in patients receiving a less effective drug to treat their condition or treatments were delayed altogether. 5 Medication errors of patients receiving the wrong dose or concentration have also been linked to drug shortages. 5, 6 As a result, drug shortages continue to pose a challenge to public health and continue to remain a top priority for FDA with efforts focused on medically necessary products that have a significant effect on public health. 1, 4 Although FDA works to mitigate drugs shortages and has helped prevent hundreds of drug shortages each year, there is a need to explore alternative strategies to help reduce the impact on patient care while a drug is on shortage. 4 Pharmacy compounding describes the act of combining, mixing, or altering of the ingredients of a drug to create a new medication tailored to the needs of an individual patient. 7 Compounding of a product is generally done pursuant to a patient-specific prescription when a commercially available product is not available to treat that patient. This could be due to a patient allergy to an ingredient in the commercially available product or the need for a different concentration, route of administration, or dosage from that which is available. Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act grants compounded products various exemptions, including the need to undergo FDA approval, certain labeling requirements, and the need to follow current good manufacturing practices (CGMP) in the preparation of the product. 8 Compounding under section 503A is done by a pharmacist in a state-licensed pharmacy or federal facility or by a licensed physician. 8 With the passage of the Drug Quality and Security Act (DQSA) in 2013, the FD&C Act was amended to include a new section, 503B. 9 Compounding under section 503B is done under the supervision of a pharmacist in a new category of voluntary compounding facilities, referred to as outsourcing facilities. These facilities are not required to be state-licensed pharmacies but register directly with FDA and are, therefore, predominately regulated and inspected by FDA. 10 Compounded products prepared in an outsourcing facility are granted similar exemptions regarding the need for FDA approval and labeling, but 1 major difference is that outsourcing facilities are required to follow CGMP. 10 In addition, outsourcing facilities are required to report to FDA every 6 months the drugs compounded during the previous 6 month period, must compound at least 1 sterile product, and are not restricted to compounding pursuant to a patient-specific prescription. 10 Outsourcing facilities are able to compound using a bulk drug substance, or pure active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), if the drug appears on a list that has been created by FDA, the 503B Bulks List, or if it appears on the shortage list maintained by FDA. 10 To protect the drug application process, regulations prohibit outsourcing facilities from compounding a product that is essentially a copy of a commercially available product. 11 However, if the drug appears on the FDA drug shortage list at the time of compounding, distribution, and dispensing, this restriction is waived. 11 Although FDA prefers to address drug shortages by working through the global supply chain to restore supplies of FDA-approved drugs, compounding could serve as an interim solution to help manage the shortage in real time. 12 When a drug is on the shortage list, the ability to compound without receipt of a patient-specific prescription and the additional leniencies granted to outsourcing facilities, including the use of a bulk drug substance and the waiver of the essentially a copy provision, outlines a framework to allow these facilities to serve a role in providing drug products currently on shortage.",

            "text": "The regulatory structure of outsourcing facilities creates a framework that outlines a role for outsourcing facilities to provide access to drugs while they are on shortage. If a drug is on shortage and unavailable from the manufacturer, the outsourcing facility would likely be forced to compound the drug using the bulk drug substance. Pursuant to the DQSA, outsourcing facilities are only able to compound using a bulk drug substance if it is on a list that has been established by FDA, the 503B Bulks List, or if the compounding, dispensing, and distribution of the product occurs while the drug is on the shortage list, defined as 60 days of the drug appearing on the shortage list. 10, 16 In addition, if the drug is on the shortage list, the restriction prohibiting outsourcing facilities from compounding essential copies of commercially available products is waived. 11 Outsourcing facilities are also required to compound sterile products, the most common type of drug on shortage, and are required to follow CGMP. This indicates that these facilities have implemented minimum requirements for the methods, facilities, and controls used in their compounding process ensuring that the product is safe and contains the right drug in the right strength. 17, 18 When this is combined with the ability of outsourcing facilities to compound in large quantities and to provide compounded products for use in another health care setting, such as a hospital or practitioner's office, there is a clear guide for the role that outsourcing facilities can play in providing drugs that are on shortage. However, when comparing the drugs on shortage as reported by FDA with the 503B product reports, there is minimal overlap.

The American Society of Health System Pharmacists held a roundtable in 2017 to discuss avenues to minimize the impact of drug shortages on patient care, and 1 potential solution was the use of outsourcing facilities. 19 However, several challenges were identified that could serve as barriers to this solution. One challenge was the unpredictable nature of drug shortages. 19 When taking into consideration the length of time in which a product will be on shortage compared with the time needed to increase production of the drug, some facilities may deem this endeavor to not be financially viable.",

While the 503B Bulks List is in development, FDA divided the bulk drug substances nominated for inclusion on the list into 3 categories. Bulk drug substances that were added to category 1 were submitted with sufficient information for evaluation, and while the list is in development, outsourcing facilities can compound using substances in category 1 regardless of whether the drug is on shortage. 16 Although not every drug was nominated for inclusion on this list, the nominations can serve as a guide for the drugs that outsourcing facilities are interested in compounding. Of the category 1 substances, 72 were on the shortage list during the reported time; however, only 32 were reported as being compounded by outsourcing facilities. Compounding using a bulk drug substance in category 1 would not be affected by the time to increase production as the compounding, dispensing, and distribution is not restricted to the time in which the substance is on shortage. Therefore, an outsourcing facility had the ability to compound using an additional 40 bulk drug substances that were on shortage without concern for the time in which the drug was on shortage.",

Outsourcing facilities report to FDA in January and June of each year all products compounded within the previous 6-month period. 20 These reports do not indicate the specific date in which a product was compounded; therefore, a direct connection between the compounding of a product and a drug going on shortage cannot be made. In addition, the reports do not indicate whether the product was compounded using the bulk drug substance or a commercially available product, which also limits the ability to connect compounding to a drug shortage. Another limitation is an analysis of the decisionmaking process a health care institution uses when developing strategies to overcome drug shortages. If there is not a demand for an outsourcing facility to compound a drug on shortage, then the role of the outsourcing facility in overcoming that shortage will be limited.",
