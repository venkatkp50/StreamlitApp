            "text": "Background: Capnocytophaga canimorsus (C. canimorsus) infections are rare and usually present with unspecific symptoms, which can eventually end in fatal septic shock and multiorgan failure. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) related coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), on the other hand, is predominantly characterized by acute respiratory failure, although other organ complications can occur. Both infectious diseases have in common that hyperinflammation with a cytokine storm can occur. While microbial detection of C. canimorsus in blood cultures can take over 48 h, diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 is facilitated by a widely available rapid antigen diagnostic test (Ag-RDT) the results of which are available within half an hour. These Ag-RDT results are commonly verified by a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), whose results are only available after a further 24 h. Case presentation: A 68-year-old male patient with the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia was referred to our Intensive Care Unit (ICU) from another hospital after testing positive on an Ag-RDT. While the initial therapy was focused on COVID-19, the patient developed a fulminant septic shock within a few hours after admission to the ICU, unresponsive to maximum treatment. SARS-CoV-2 NAATs were negative, but bacteremia of C. canimorsus was diagnosed post-mortem. Further anamnestic information suggest that a small skin injury caused by a dog leash or the subsequent contact of this injury with the patient's dog could be the possible point of entry for these bacteria. Conclusion: During the acute phase of hyperinflammation and cytokine storm, laboratory results can resemble both, sepsis of bacterial origin or SARS-CoV-2. This means that even in the light of a global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, where this diagnosis provides the most salient train of thoughts, differential diagnoses must be considered. Ag-RDT can contribute to early detection of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, but false-positive results may cause fixation errors with severe consequences for patient outcome.",

            "text": "In December 2019, the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged from Wuhan/China and triggered the worldwide coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic [1, 2] . Clinically relevant SARS-CoV-2 infections primarily cause pneumonia, which can potentially result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but other organ systems than the patient's lungs can subsequently be affected, too [2] . World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines recommend rapid antigen diagnostic tests (Ag-RDT) as a fast, widely available early detection method for SARS-CoV-2 proteins. These tests should always be complemented by a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) [3] . Antigenspecific point-of-care tests contribute to the overall testing capacities due to their simple handling and rapid and laboratory-independent results. Ag-RDT are especially useful in pre-symptomatic or early symptomatic patients and in communities with a high prevalence of active SARS-CoV-2 infections. Especially in regional hospitals Ag-RDTs are used to detect SARS-CoV-2 infections, since results of the gold standard NAAT are usually available only on the following day [3] . Here, we present the case of an assumed COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosed with an initial positive Ag-RDT result that post-mortem turned out to be C. canimorsus sepsis, which resulted in a lethal outcome (Fig. 1 ).",

Duplex ultrasound examination was performed for the diagnosis of suspected acute peripheral arterial occlusion. The patient's past medical history included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, arterial hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux and myocardial infarction. No history of immunosuppression or substance abuse was reported. Anamnestically, he reported to have travelled to Switzerland a few weeks earlier, where the incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2-infections was 122 per 100,000 inhabitants at the time [4] . The diagnosis of COVID-19 was considered likely, given the respiratory impairment and positive test for SARS-CoV-2 antigens by an Ag-RDT (NADAL\u00ae, Nal von Minden GmbH, Moers, Germany). Given the patient was admitted prior to the roll-out of vaccines in Germany, he was not vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. Consequently, he was sent to the specialized COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) of the University Medical Centre in Goettingen for further treatment of suspected COVID-19pneumonia and acute peripheral arterial occlusion only a few hours after first hospital admission. The ICU is specialized in ARDS treatment and a member of the ARDS network Germany as well as the extracorporeal life support organization (ELSO). It is staffed with ICU specialized nurses and doctors with appropriate training and expertise. ",

Non-invasive ventilation was used to support breathing, and bronchodilatory therapy was initiated due to severe bronchial spasm. A chest X-Ray showed moderate opacities on both lower lobes. The patient was started on appropriate vasopressor therapy (norepinephrine) as well as empirical antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam plus clarithromycin) to cover for the possible diagnosis of community acquired pneumonia. High serum concentrations of interleukin-6 (> 50,000 pg/ml) and high C-reactive protein (up to 278.8 mg/l) levels were consistent with hyperinflammation and a severe cytokine storm. Suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection led to combined drug therapy with camostat mesilate, remdesivir and dexamethasone, which was the standard treatment of the ICU at the time. Further analyses of the blood sample showed lactic acidosis (lactate: 6.7 mmol/l) and confirmed progressive acute kidney injury. As buffering with trometamol and therapy with crystalloid solutions did not improve the overall kidney function, we escalated continuous renal replacement therapy with citrate anticoagulation and continuous cytokine hemadsorption. Both of the patient's lower limbs were examined via computer tomography angiography, showing no evidence for an acute peripheral occlusion. Upon visual examination, the right leg showed two small abrasions (1 to 2 cm) with dry scab covering the wound, but without signs of local inflammation. A nasal swab test was taken for a NAAT.",

But even further to this, a rapid antigen test probably pushed the initially attending staff more towards the diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 infection. In this case a NADAL\u00ae COVID-19 rapid antigen test (Nal von Minden GmbH, Moers, Germany) was performed. Independent studies confirm a sensitivity of 100% for high viral loads, a sensitivity from 41.7 to 77.8% for low viral loads and a specificity of 99.3% [13] . Because sensitivity can be < 100%, confirmatory testing by NAAT is recommended [3] . As confirmatory testing by NAAT was negative on two occasions we assume a false-positive Ag-RDT. The patient was not administered with empiric antimicrobials at the community hospital. However, in case of sepsis each hour of delay in antibiotic treatment increases the risk of mortality [14] . Treatment with piperacillin plus tazobactam and clarithromycin was started only after ICU admission, again committing the fixation error and assuming a community-acquired pneumonia in addition to COVID-19 and not considering possible sepsis. According to international recommendations a prophylactic use of antibiotics in COVID-19 is not recommended, however if a community-acquired pneumonia is suspected antibiotics should be applied [15, 16] .",

As the present case illustrates, these guidelines as well as history taking, and thorough clinical examination make a significant contribution to a patient's outcome. Medical teams face great levels of stress during the current pandemic, be it by increasingly long shifts or facing the risk of catching the virus themselves. With such increasing levels of stress, cognitive errors such as a fixation error are more likely to happen. In this example, a suspected case of COVID-19 diagnosed on the base of a false-positive Ag-RDT result and suspected acute arterial occlusion led to a biased decision and ultimately to a delayed antibiotic treatment. This is also what the transfer report from the community hospital suggests: The clinician in charge at the community hospital documented a suspected COVID-19 pneumonia and an acute arterial occlusion of the right leg, which supports the belief that there was a fixation error rather than a failure to appreciate the severity of the patients' illness. In the end, ICU and emergency teams should always question the anamnesis, laboratory results and clinical findings and consider different diagnoses and trains of thoughts. Even if a diagnosis like SARS-CoV-2 infection might temporarily be the most salient diagnosis. Well-established guidelines are a great first port of call, but even the most experienced team should be reminded that fixation errors can occur and should be prevented by being reminded of cases like the one presented here.",
