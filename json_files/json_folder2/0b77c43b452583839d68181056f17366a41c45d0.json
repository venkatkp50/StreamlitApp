We sought to characterise the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on bicycle-related injuries in children presenting to a tertiary care paediatric ED. Methods: We conducted a descriptive, cross-sectional study of ED visits to a large urban tertiary children's hospital, comparing March to October 2020 (the study period) to the same date range 2 years prior (i.e. March to October 2018-2019). We included children 0-17.99 years presenting for a bicycle-related injury. We compared absolute visit counts of bike injuries per month, demographics, triage acuity, injury type and disposition.",

            "text": "Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the volume and presentations to emergency departments (EDs) in both adult and paediatric populations have changed. Multiple studies noted an overall decrease in non-COVID-related presentations as well as an increase in overall acuity. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] There has been ongoing focus in understanding these new trends, what their implications are, and how to best address them as the pandemic continues. Studies have shown mixed results with regards to injury and trauma. Some studies have shown a decline in home-related injuries and trauma 1,6,7 while others have suggested an increase in specific home-related injuries, such as burns and poisonings. 8, 9 These findings are understood in the context of fewer organised sports, decreased utilisation of cars and an overall increase in children at home. Nevertheless, the mandatory stay-at-home orders have had a clear influence on the rate of home-related injuries and presentation to EDs. The onset of stay-at-home orders began in March 2020, encouraging working-from-home, minimising inperson interactions and eliminating non-essential travel. The initial lockdown was followed by progressive openings and lifting of restrictions from stages 1 to 3. With quarantine and cancellation of school and summer camps, there has been an increased use of bicycles. 10 As previous studies have demonstrated, more bicycle use can lead to an increase in cycling-related injuries. 11 This risk is not evenly distributed; rather, the risk of injuries is highest amongst children. 11 In children, the types of injuries seen with bicycles are most commonly abrasions and soft tissue injuries, followed by extremity injuries, lacerations and head injuries. 11, 12 In addition, the vast majority of injuries occur close to home. 11 Serious injuries have also been well documented. These include severe head trauma, internal organ injury and bleeding (largely related to handle-bar injuries), and death. [11] [12] [13] [14] To date, there has been no specific exploration of paediatric bicycle-related injuries during the COVID-19 pandemic. We sought to characterise the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on bicycle-related injuries in children 0-17.99 years presenting to a tertiary care paediatric ED. This was primarily done by describing the incidence of bicycle-related injuries presenting to the ED during the COVID-19 Pandemic as compared to a similar cohort in previous years. Secondary objectives examined changes in bicycle-related injuries, acuity, disposition and outcome.",
