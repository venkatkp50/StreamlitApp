            "text": "Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), took more lives than combined epidemics of SARS, MERS, H1N1, and Ebola. Currently, the prevention and control of spread are the goals in COVID-19 management as there are no specific drugs to cure or vaccines available for prevention. Hence, the drug repurposing was explored by many research groups, and many target proteins have been examined. The major protease (M pro ), and RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) are two target proteins in SARS-CoV-2 that have been validated and extensively studied for drug development in COVID-19. The RdRp shares a high degree of homology between those of two previously known coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Methods: In this study, the FDA approved library of drugs were docked against the active site of RdRp using Schrodinger's computeraided drug discovery tools for in silico drug-repurposing. Results: We have shortlisted 14 drugs from the Standard Precision docking and interaction-wise study of drug-binding with the active site on the enzyme. These drugs are antibiotics, NSAIDs, hypolipidemic, coagulant, thrombolytic, and anti-allergics. In molecular dynamics simulations, pitavastatin, ridogrel and rosoxacin displayed superior binding with the active site through ARG555 and divalent magnesium. Conclusion: Pitavastatin, ridogrel and rosoxacin can be further optimized in preclinical and clinical studies to determine their possible role in COVID-19 treatment.

A new strain of RNA virus of the Coronaviridae family was isolated from the patient's bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and was originally unique initially referred to as 'WH-Human 1' coronavirus (and later known as '2019-nCoV') was. The novel virus was with 60-140 nm diameter with 9-12 nm long spikes, with the virion comparable to the corona of the sun. Viral genome analysis revealed that it is made of ~30k nucleotides, and has 89.1% nucleotide similarity to SARS-like CoV (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) 1 . The human CoV B814-strain was isolated in 1965 from the nasal discharge of a patient with a common cold. Since then, 30 specific strains were identified. Seven hCoVs have been reported previously causes disease, including HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and 2019-nCoV (now established as SARS-CoV-2) 2 . SARS-CoV emerged during the period 2000-2004, and it was discovered that the infection was descended from animals and bats as intermediate hosts 3 . MERS-CoV was diagnosed for the first time in Saudi Arabia 4 . The World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on 12 January 2020. The same outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern by the WHO on 30-January-2020 due to rapid transmission mortality rate 5 . The International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) proposed the name of nCoV as SARS-CoV-2 6 .",

The remdesivir and favipiravir are comparatively expensive than dexamethasone and not affordable for people at developing countries. Vaccine development, convalescent plasma, interferon-based therapies, small molecule medications, cell-based therapy, and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are the various likely future medications and pathways being investigated 7 . The development of a drug is expensive and time-consuming with a high attrition rate, which is unacceptable in the current global emergency. Hence, there is a great interest in repurposing the existing drugs and speed-up to develop antiviral therapies 8 . The national health commission (NHC) of the People's Republic of China recommends the use of \u03b1-interferon (IFN-\u03b1), lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, chloroquine phosphate, and arbidol as antiviral therapy against SARS-CoV-2. Other agents such as inhibition of fusion/entry (camostat mesylate, baricitinib, arbidol and chloroquine phosphate), the agents that disrupt SARS-CoV-2 replication (remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir/ritonavir), the agents that suppress excessive inflammatory response (corticosteroid), convalescent plasma, vaccines (inactivated vaccine, recombinant subunits vaccine, nucleic acid-based vaccine, adenoviral vector vaccine, recombinant influenza viral vector vaccine), a combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine (ShuFeng JieDu capsules and Lianhua Qingwen capsules) are also gaining therapeutic interest 9 .",

SARS-CoV-2 replication is facilitated through a multi-subunit replication/transcription complex of non-structural viral proteins. The key aspect of the nsp complex is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp; nsp12). The central RdRp domain is divided into three subdomains, the thumb, palm, and right-handed cup-like fingers, which is less than 500 long amino acids length 11 . A high level of homology has been found between SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV RdRp 13 . The RdRp requires extra factors such as nsp7 and nsp8, for its activity 14 . Remdesivir, which was recently approved by US-FDA for COVID-19, inhibits RdRp 15 . Furthermore, researchers have explored RdRp-target for in silico repurposing of drugs. Hence, this proves that Nsp12 or RdRp is an attractive target for inhibiting viral replication. In the current study, we assessed USFDA approved drugs to impede the RdRp activity of SARS-CoV-2 through an in silico drug-repurposing strategy.",

The amino acid framework of SARS-CoV RdRp linked to the Nsp7 and Nsp8 cofactors 24 . Structurally, the RdRp protein is divided into the N-terminal and polymerase domains. The N-terminal domain extends from amino acid residues 1 to 397. The polymerase domain extends from amino acids 398 to 919 and is similar to the previously reported SARS-CoV nsp12 (PDB ID: 6NUR). The RdRp polymerase domain is subdivided into three structurally different subunits, namely the finger subunit (398-581 and 628-687 amino acids), palm subunit (582-627 and 688-815 amino acids), and thumb subunit (816-919 amino acids), which embraces a \"right-handed\" shaped conformation 15 . The active site is located at the hinge interface between the finger and thumb subunits of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, which is an evolutionary conserved in both the coronaviruses reported earlier, ie. MERS and SARS-nsp12. The active site of nsp12 is situated in the middle of the substrate domain where the synthesis of RNA takes place as an RNA template is accessed from the template input channel and nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) from NTP input channel 25 . Structural assessment of SARS-CoV-2 defined in RdRp displayed the presence of seven retained motifs (A-G motifs), which play a key role in the association of substrate and nucleotides. They also play a key role in catalysis of the attachment of the NTP. Antiviral drugs function by binding to first replicated base pairs and thereby stopping the chain elongation cycle. The sensitivity of the RdRp binding to the RNA prototype has been enhanced by the interaction of the nsp7 and nsp8 co-factors with RdRp. The RNA polymerization activity appeared to be impaired in the presence of remdesivir active triphosphate (RTP), which is being investigated in clinical trials. Remdesivir blocked the polymerization process of RdRp at 1 mM and 10 mM ATP completely. However, remdesivir alone on its own or in its monophosphate form did not demonstrate activity at 5 mM concentration. Remdesivir monophosphate was found to be covalently linked to the primary strand in protein structure to the pyrophosphate moiety and three magnesium as catalytic ions. The ligand-protein interaction of remdesivir also has two hydrogen bonds, with the uridine base, which leads to a stable complex formation. Predominant interactions include those with K545 and R55 side chains, the interaction of magnesium ions with the backbone of the phosphate diester, as well as with the primary strand RNA. Seven conserved motifs from A to G represent the nsp12 RdRp catalytic active site, among which the palm subdomain with an SDD sequence (residues 759-761) in motif C, including amino acid residues D760 and D761 in the coordination of the two magnesium ions. The template-primer RNA, which oriented in the same fashion as template-primer RNA in the poliovirus RdRp elongation complex and residues involved in binding as well as interactions to 2\u2032-OH groups, was found to be highly conserved 15 .",

The SP docking was performed on 500 molecules, which exhibited good interactions with the RdRp and had topped in the docking score. Among the 500 molecules, 14 displaying top SP-docking scores and the conserved interactions with the active site as that of remdesivir were shortlisted based on visual inspection (Table 1) .

            "text": "Molecular docking of FDA-approved drugs for RdRp led us to shortlist 14 molecules. There were many proposals of RdRp inhibitors for repurposing, especially by in silico computational simulations. One previous report used the ZINC drug database to screen SARS-CoV-2 RdRp inhibitors 13 . They studied 78 commonly used antiviral drugs and drugs which are currently in clinical trials for COVID-19 for molecular simulations and reported the possible in silico repurposing of drugs. They have listed the top 20 drugs from the ZINC-drug database that included the currently used antiviral drug valganciclovir, anti-bacterial drugs such as chlorhexidine, ceftibuten, cefuroxime, novobiocin, the anti-asthmatic drugs fenoterol and cromolyn, the antitumour drugs such as fludarabine, idarubicin, the antimalarial drug atovaquone, the muscle relaxant pancuronium, the anti-allergic cortisone, the contraceptive tibolone, the hepatoprotective silybin, the anti-diarrheal drug diphenoxylate, the anti-amenorrheal bromocriptine, and chenodeoxycholic acid, which is used to dissolve gallstones. In the same study, the investigators shortlisted the top-20 natural compounds as RdRp inhibitors. Another group of researchers studied the feasibility of known RNA-polymerase inhibitors to repurpose as anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs 42 . The drugs they studied are broadspectrum antiviral agents such as remdesivir, 5-fluorouracil, ribavirin and favipiravir. However, they noted that the SARS-CoV-2 might evolve to acquire drug resistance mutations against these nucleoside inhibitors. The virtually combined deep learning and molecular docking simulations approach identified potentially useful 49 most promising FDA-approved drugs for repurposing in COVID-19 43 . The selected drugs in this study were anidulafungin, velpatasvir, glecaprevir, rifabutin, procaine penicillin G, tadalafil, riboflavin 5'-monophosphate, flavin adenine dinucleotide, terlipressin, desmopressin, elbasvir, oxatomide, enasidenib, edoxaban and selinexor. Another group of computational chemists studied the FDA-approved drugs by virtual screening for the three proteases of SARS-CoV-2, M pro , PL pro and RdRp 44 . They have shortlisted promising antiviral drugs such as simeprevir, ledipasvir, idarubicin, saquinavir, ledipasivir, partitaprevir, glecaprevir, and velpatasvir. They also shortlisted several novel drugs such as antiviral raltegravir; antidiabetic amaryl, antibiotics retapamulin, rifimixin, and rifabutin; antiemetic fosaprepitant and netupitant. Another group of researchers used a multi-targetted approach and shortlisted molecules such as \u03b4-viniferin, myricitrin, taiwanhomoflavone A, lactucopicrin 15-oxalate, nympholide A, afzelin, biorobin, hesperidin and phyllaemblicin B. These molecules have the affinity for SARS-CoV-2 M pro , RdRp and hACE2 45 . Furthermore, a group of researcher have proposed well-tolerated, cost-effective drugs to combat COVID-19 which has the affinity for both M pro and RdRp. The compounds they have shortlisted are ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, conivaptan, paliperidone, and tipranavir 46 .",

Authors have attempted to find the possibility of finding drug in the repository of available drug bank which can be repurposed.Many of the articles are appearing where computational tools have been utilized targeting the major protease (M pro ), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) which are two validated target proteins till now.Authors have docked the FDA approved library of drugs against the active site of RdRp using Schrodinger's computer-aided drug discovery tools for in silico drug-repurposing. They have shortlisted 14 drugs from the Standard Precision docking and interaction-wise study of drugbinding with the active site on the enzyme. These drugs are antibiotics, NSAIDs, hypolipidemic, coagulant, thrombolytic, and anti-allergics. Also, they have carried out MD simulation studies on the best among those. The study will be useful for further explorations for in vitro and in vivo studies. The authors have focused only on computational studies and in vitro studies on selected few would have been handy.Overall, the work is well drafted with minor errors and is suitable for the researchers who are looking for molecules to be studied in vitro on COVID-19.",
