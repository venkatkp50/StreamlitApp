Economic forces, including urban agglomeration, industrial districts, concentration of large companies (both before and after the beginning of the 'lockdown') and a north-south gradient, are the most significant predictors of the strength of COVID-19 infection. These effects are statistically more robust in the spatial models than in the aspatial ones. We interpretate our results in the light of pitfalls related to data reliability, and we discuss policy implications and possible avenues for future research.",

After the quarantine imposed in some of the most infected municipalities in the north of the country -Codogno, in the province of Lodi (Lombardy), and V\u00f2 Euganeo, 1 in the province of Padua (Veneto)a full quarantine strategy was established by the national government on March 11, 2020, with the objective to counter the spreading of the virus and lower the pressure on the public health system.",

In addition to preparedness (e.g., through strengthening health systems), which requires long-term investment, it is equally important to understand how to improve territorial resilience to pandemic shocks in the short run. Research into COVID-19 in Italy suggests that its spatial spreading has been far from uniform; hence, academic interest is now devoted to understanding the 'conditioning factors' that may explain the spatial variation of COVID-19 cases and related mortality. Among these factors, there is growing consensus that a wide range of factorsdemographic, economic, and environmentalmay explain the intrinsic variation of detected COVID-19 cases over space. The spreading of the virus can be affected by place-specific factors and the degree of connectiveness of local economies to wider global networks, for example, mimicking a transmission through jump modes. This article aims to contribute to this lively debate by investigating the determinants of contagion in Italy during the first wave of the pandemic. Our analysis confirms that there is a positive and significant correlation between COVID-19 diffusion and a set of socioeconomic variables related to population age structure, urbanization, climate, presence of large firms, and spatial clustering of manufacturing activities.",

Second, the significant economic determinants associated with COVID-19 contagion at the province level suggest that the management of economic activities can be the object of policies to enhance the preparedness for future occurrence of pandemics and shocks through an appropriate organization of work both within large establishments and along local production networks of suppliers and subcontractors that are the typical organization of firms operating in industrial districts.",

For example, focusing on a sample of 119 regional economies in nine EU countries, Kapitsinis (2020) provides early evidence on a variety of underlying factors affecting the spreading of COVID-19. Air quality, demographics, global interconnectedness, urbanization trends, and historic trends in health expenditure as well as the policies implemented to mitigate the pandemic were found to have influenced the regionally uneven mortality rate of Italy was the second country severely affected by the spread of the virus, after the causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first detected in the human population in Wuhan City, Hubei Province (China) around the beginning of December 2019. In this regard, the Italian case is particularly interesting due to the highly concentrated and spatially persistent patterns of the early diffusion of the virus (Figure 1 ), at least compared with neighboring countries (for an account of the high spatial concentration of excess mortality across EU regions, see Guibourg, 2020) .",

A simple visual inspection of spatiotemporal pattern of across Italian provinces ( Figure 1 ) hints at the effectiveness of lockdown measures in counteracting the contagion, a result already pointed out by studies in the related literature. Bertuzzo et al. (2020) , for instance, have confirmed that the virus transmission was substantially reduced during the lockdown. Cross-country panel analysis confirms that lockdown has been effective in reducing the R 0 index, that is, the number of people infected by each infected person, and that its efficacy has continued to hold 20 days after the introduction of the policy (Alfano & Ercolano, 2020) .",

Table 1 reports the estimated percentage of local units drawn from a SVIMEZ report and estimates based on official statistics (Italian National Institute of Statistics, ISTAT) data. On the one hand, it is evident that some essential servicessuch as public utilities, education, healthcare, and transportcontinued functioning even during the lockdown, most of them thanks to extensive use of teleworking. On the other hand, several nonessential service sectors have had to stop their activities completely. The provisioning of essential goods and services inevitably determines a risk of contagion for those workers who are involved. In the case of manufacturing, six out of ten local units have closed down. In the cases of construction and trade, the percentages are higher, 70% and 86%, respectively. Since in industrial activities the fraction of teleworkable employment is low, local economies highly specialized in industrial activities may have been subject to some degree of propagation of the disease even during the lockdown because of the size of industry employment. For this reason, our hypothesis is that different local economic structure may have played a moderating effect on the reduction of COVID-19 cases after March 11, 2020; therefore, we included an index of relative industrial specialization as a control variable.",

Early epidemiological studies on hospitalized patients suggest that older people have a higher probability of being severely affected by the virus (e.g., Chen et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020) . The empirical evidence produced so far confirms that, at least in the first wave of the epidemic in Italy, the virus has spread rapidly in more densely populated areas, and in areas where the incidence of older population was higher (Bourdin et al., 2020; Musolino & Rizzi, 2020) .",

Nevertheless, the role of temperature and other weather conditions is still controversial. For example, Palialol et al., 2020 suggest that warm climate can diminish the virus transmission, but they find that the effect of temperature is stronger in cold climates. They show that the number of COVID-19 cases is negatively correlated with temperature and humidity, but not with precipitation. This is in line with recent observations of faster spread of the virus in cold and dry environments (Antonietti et al., 2020; Araujo & Naimi, 2020; Confalonieri et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) .",

As noticed, the geographical distribution of COVID-19 across Italian provinces is highly uneven, and therefore it is deemed to be subject to spatial correlation (e.g., Bourdin et al., 2020; Ghosh & Cartone, 2020) . Spatial aspects in model specifications can be classified into two main categories, namely spatial dependence and spatial heterogeneity. First, any econometric analysis for the issue at hand must verify and eventually handle the presence of spatial dependence, the fact that the value assumed by a certain dependent variable (e.g., cases) and/or independent variables depends on the value that the same variable assumes in the neighboring regions. Second, spatial heterogeneity should be accounted for since it is particularly relevant for the case of Italy (among others, Benedetti et al., 2020; Panzera & Postiglione, 2014) . To control for this second concern, we assume discrete heterogeneity (Anselin, 2010) and we explicitly consider two different exogenous regimes (Le Gallo & Dall'erba, 2003 , 2006 by dividing Italy into north and south provinces and estimating separate spatial models, allowing model coefficients and other parameters to vary between the two groups.",

First, the positive relation between the north-south gradient and the strength of COVID-19 infection points to the relevance of a well-known dichotomy in the Italian economic and social conditions. This study could therefore be useful also for the design of containment policies addressing EU targets, such as Objective 1 regions of the Lisbon strategy, as southern Italy completely corresponded with Objective 1 regions. At the same time, our results indicate the need for locally differentiated containment policies based on a comprehensive understanding of spatial conditions as far as the spreading of contagion is concerned. A system differentiating administrative regions (NUTS-2 level) with a vast series of restrictions based on a set of multiple indicators has been adopted in Italy since fall 2020. This system seems to be better adapted to recognize priorities in containment actions based on the local diffusion of COVID-19, although criticism exists on the fact that administrative regions, especially the largest in size (e.g., Lombardy) and those most differentiated in socioeconomic conditions (e.g., Campania), are too heterogeneous as far as the spreading of virus is concerned. In this way, many provinces and municipalities in affected regions where heavy restrictions were undertaken, can have zero or few contagions, free hospitals, and no deaths from COVID-19. A refined spatial modulation of containment measures is thus necessary, and this study suggests that provinces are sufficiently homogeneous contexts as far as territorial and socioeconomic variability is concerned.",

The territories widely equipped with infrastructures and services and integrated on a global scale, which in ordinary conditions are attractive for economic and residential activities, have emerged as particularly at risk because they are more exposed to the spread of the contagion. On the other hand, in the context of social distancing, the peripheral areas that tend to be considered vulnerable have revealed the advantages of greater availability of space and more rarefied interpersonal contacts. Nonetheless, the pandemic has also made more evident than before how infrastructuredigital and physicalis in short supply in more remote areas and should be a policy priority to foster economic development. In fact, first evidence with Irish data suggests that more affluent, dense and highly populated, better educated, and better broadband-provisioned towns have greater potential for social distancing and remote working (Crowley & Doran, 2020) . In the 'new normal', it is likely that housing choices will change in light of new spatial organization of workplaces (teleworking), and new housing and leisure preferences. Accordingly, it will be interesting to understand, in retrospect, whether and to what extent the emerging behaviors during the emergency period have translated into permanent changes in territorial structures and whether these changes have had positive effects on the well-being of local communities. More importantly, policymakers and practitioners should consider whether and how to adapt regional policies and urban planning to these possible modifications in individual preferences.",

The variance of the dependent variable for the whole sample is nearly 2,500 times larger than the mean. After the regression, we tested the Poisson goodness of fit (gof) of the model (with the Stata poisgof command). Results are: LR \u03c7 2 (7) = 104,379.55; Prob > \u03c7 2 = 0.0000; Pearson goodness of fit = 55,236.38; Prob > \u03c7 2 (94) = 0.0000. The large value for \u03c7 2 in the gof is another indicator that the Poisson distribution is not a good choice. A highly significant (p < 0.05) test statistic from the gof indicates that the Poisson model is inappropriate.",

            "text": "3 As for the classic LM tests proposed by Anselin (1988) , the critical value to reject the null hypothesis of no spatially lagged dependent variable, at 5% significance, amounts to 9.36, while the critical value to reject the null hypothesis of no spatially autocorrelated error term amounts to 5.72. When using the robust LM tests proposed by Anselin et al. (1996) , the hypothesis of no spatially lagged dependent variable must still be rejected, though only at 10% significance, whereas the hypothesis of no spatially autocorrelated error term can no longer be rejected; the robust LM test for the spatial lag amounts to 3.72 and for the spatial error to 0.08. If both the conditions hold true, it indicates that the spatial lag model (SAR) is more appropriate (Elhorst, 2014) . Both tests are based on the residuals of the OLS model and are asymptotically distributed as a \u03c7 2 distribution with one degree of freedom. The important difference is that the robust LM-error test corrects for the presence of local spatial lag dependence. Similarly, the robust LM-lag statistic tests the null hypothesis of no spatial correlation in the dependent variable, correcting for presence of local spatial error dependence. Nevertheless, Elhorst (2014) also suggested that the initial approach of spatial econometrics with a central focus on the spatial lag model (SAR) and the spatial error model (SEM), with one type of interaction effect, is too limited and that the focus should shift to other models such as the spatial Durbin model (SDM). Unfortunately, in this case, the interaction effects among the dependent variable on the one hand and interaction effects among the error terms on the other hand are only weakly identified.",
