As the determinants of vaccination differ across vaccines, target groups and contexts, we investigate COVID-19 vaccination intention using data from university students from three countries, the Netherlands, Belgium and Portugal, and the 5C model. This model includes five antecedents of vaccination: Confidence, Complacency, Constraints, Calculation and Collective Responsibility. First, we show that the majority of students have a positive propensity toward getting vaccinated against COVID-19, though only 41% of students are completely acceptant. Second, using the 5C model, we show that 'Confidence' and",

For the first objective, 297 the percentage of students who indicated a certain degree of willingness to get vaccinated against 298 COVID-19 were calculated. For the second objective, one-sided ordinary least squares (OLS) 299 regression analyses were conducted with the 5C subscales as independent variables, vaccination 300 intention as a dependent variable, and country and gender as control variables. We controlled for 301 country differences by including country dummies, and Dutch students were used as a reference 302 group. The standardized coefficients of the regression analysis were used to assess the effect sizes 303 of all Cs to conclude which of these components is most important in explaining COVID-19 304 vaccination intention among students. Finally, for the third objective, mediation analyses were 305 conducted using the PROCESS macro in SPSS [54] . The models were estimated for all predictors 306 of a particular C at the same time; consequently, the direct and indirect effects were estimated 307 while controlling for the other predictors of the C. All resulting paths were therefore as if they 308 have been estimated simultaneously using simultaneous equation modeling [54] . Three regression 309 models were estimated. Model 1 includes the independent variables and controls, with 310 vaccination intention as the dependent variable. This model presents the total effect for the 311 independent variables (c, see Fig 2) . Model 2 includes all independent variables and controls, 312 with the mediator as the dependent variable. This model includes path 'a' (Fig 2) . Finally, Model 313 3 includes-next to the independent variables and controls-the mediator as a predictor, with 314 vaccination intention as the dependent variable. This model contains the direct effect (c' , Fig 2) 315 and path b (Fig 2) . To estimate the indirect effect, bias-corrected bootstrapping was used to 316 generate a 95% confidence interval (CI). Bias-corrected bootstrapping is now considered the 317 standard for testing mediation [55, 56] . A common seed was used so that at each run, the 318 bootstrap confidence intervals were based on the same set of 10,000 resamples from the data 319 (85.49%) indicated that they intended to get vaccinated within a range between 'probably' and 334 'definitely', only 40.9% of the students were totally convinced to get vaccinated ('definitely 335 yes'). Only a very small group was totally resistant to COVID-19 vaccination (1.58%) and 336 indicated that they will 'definitely not' get vaccinated. Almost 1 out of 10 students (9.41%) 337 indicated a negative propensity toward COVID-19 vaccination, as they answered within a range 338 between 'probably not' and 'definitely not'.

As the determinants of vaccination differ across vaccines, target groups and Confidence'. The perceived risk of COVID-19 for one's social circle and altruism, the need to 32 belong and psychopathy traits indirectly affect vaccination intention through 'Collective Responsibility'.The development of a vaccine has been recognized as a crucial means to halt the spread of 38 COVID-19. Since effective vaccines against COVID-19 have been developed [1][2], the greatest 39 challenge is to ensure sufficiently high vaccination rates to establish herd immunity. The 40 estimates of the needed vaccination rates to achieve herd immunity range from 67% to 95% [3-41In 2019, the World Health Organization declared 'vaccine hesitancy' one of the top ten 43 threats to global health[6]. Vaccine hesitancy is defined as the refusal or reluctance to get 44 vaccinated despite the availability of a vaccine[7]. Vaccine hesitancy has become more 45 problematic in recent decades[8], with the highest levels of skepticism being found in Europe 46[9]. In a sample of over 7,000 Europeans, 18.9% of respondents reported being unsure about 47 getting vaccinated against COVID-19, while 7.2% indicated that they will certainly not get 48 vaccinated[10]. Even more pessimistic numbers have been shown in a UK and Irish sample, with 49 only 65% and 69% of respondents fully willing to get vaccinated, respectively[11]. 50Governments and public health agencies must be prepared to address COVID-19 vaccine 51 hesitancy[12]. Given its novelty, much is still unknown about the acceptance and motivation 52 behind COVID-19 vaccination. This vaccine differs from previous vaccines in many respects: 53 development speed, innovativeness of the techniques used, uncertainty regarding the magnitude 54 and extent of its effectiveness, and potential side effects. As vaccination willingness is context-, 55time-, place-, and vaccine-dependent [13], research on COVID-19 vaccination intention and its 56 antecedents is needed, preferably across a variety of target groups and countries. 57 Previous literature reports potential barriers to vaccine acceptance at different levels [14], 58 ranging from the political and sociocultural levels to the individual level. At the aggregate level, 59 in addition to factors such as the availability and cost of vaccines [7], trust in health officials, the 60 media and governments play an important role in vaccination intention [8]. At the individual 61 level, studies have, among others, shown the relevance of psychological theories of behavior for 62 vaccine acceptance, like the theory of planned behavior [15-17]. Several models have been 63 developed to integrate previous literature on vaccination behavior, such as the 3C [7], 4C [15] 64 and 5C models [18]. The most recent model, the 5C model, includes five psychological 65",

A French translation was available [27], while a Dutch translation 174 was performed by two native Dutch speakers individually, after which a consensus meeting took 175 place to discuss and decide on inconsistencies. All items are scored in a way such that a higher 176 score indicates a higher degree of the C assessed. The scores of one of the items of the Collective 177 Responsibility subscale was reversed to be in line with this scoring ('When everyone is 178 vaccinated, I don't have to get vaccinated too'). Internal consistency, as reflected by Cronbach's 179 alpha, is acceptable in our sample: Confidence \u03b1 =.87, Complacency \u03b1=70, Constraints \u03b1=.69, 180 Calculation \u03b1=.76, Collective responsibility \u03b1=.71. 181",

The table shows that all Cs are significantly related to vaccination intention in the 348 expected direction based on the previous literature. Higher Confidence in the vaccine and higher 349 feelings of Collective Responsibility both lead to higher intentions to get vaccinated against 350 COVID-19, while higher Complacency, Calculation and Constraints lead to lower COVID-19 351 vaccination intentions.
