            "text": "Turkey, with rich tourism diversity and destinations, has experienced considerable changes in the tourism sector as one of the top ten most visited countries over two decades. Research shows that increasing mutual interaction and integration among countries and different cultures encourage visitors and contribute to tourism sector development. In this respect, in the light of available data, globalization performance in Turkey has been ongoing above the world average since 1970. On the other hand, the country has suffered terror attacks that are a significant deterrent factor for tourism. Hundreds of bombings and armed assaults occurred until very recently. However, empirical evidence on the role of terrorism and globalization in the tourism sector is not sufficient to clearly understand tourist behaviors and to provide new insights into the literature. Considering the probable effects of globalization and terrorism, Turkey is an excellent case to investigate tourism sector development within this framework. Therefore, this study aims to investigate how tourist arrivals to Turkey react to globalization level and terror attacks by using advanced time-series analysis covering the period 1980-2018. Results reveal that globalization and terrorism are essential determinants of tourist arrivals in Turkey.",

            "text": "Tourism sector has gained significant momentum as a result of economic development, decreases in air transportation costs, and technological advances. According to recent research by the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC 2019a), the contribution of the tourism sector to global gross domestic product is 10.4% and 319 million jobs, which corresponds to 10% of the total employment in 2018. Table 6 .1 presents the world's top ten countries in the number of international tourist arrivals and tourism receipts. The total number of tourists reached 1,460 billion in 2019, growing by 3.6% as compared to 2018. Nine out of the top ten countries enjoyed favorable growth rates in the number of tourist arrivals. France remained the world's most popular tourist destination hosting more than 90 million foreign tourists, followed by Spain, the United States, China, and Turkey. Alongside these countries, Mexico, Thailand, Germany, and the United Kingdom also managed to enter the top ten tourist destinations worldwide. International tourism receipts reached $1,479 billion in 2019, growing 1.5% compared to the previous year. The United States is the top tourism earner by far, followed by Spain, France, Thailand, and the UK.",

            "text": "A striking insight from Table 6 .1 is that while the United States ranks third in the number of tourist arrivals, it earns the most revenue from tourism by far. The share of the United States in tourist arrivals is around 5.5%, while the percentage of its tourism receipts is 14.5%. Another aspect worth mentioning is that the improvement in the number of tourist arrivals to Turkey is not in line with its tourism receipts. While Turkey ranks as the 6th most popular tourist destination, it ranks only 13th in terms of tourism receipts. To make a comparison, Turkey hosted 51.2 million tourists with a tourism receipt of $29.8 billion, while Germany hosted 39.6 million tourists with a receipt of $41.6 billion. In other words, Germany generated $10 billion more in tourism revenue than Turkey despite hosting 10 million fewer visitors than Turkey. As a result of increased wealth and life expectancy, lower transportation costs, better pensions and advertising, worldwide tourism has been growing since the 1950s. Between 1950 and 2019 the number of international tourist arrivals has grown massively from 25 million to 1.5 billion. On the other hand, the short-term tourism sector is highly volatile due to domestic and foreign shocks. Among the various shocks affecting the tourism sector, diseases and terrorism are the most harmful ones. Broke out in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019, Covid-19 hit tourism sector so hard that UNWTO (2020a) projects that the number of international visitors will drop by 60-80% in 2020, contrary to the previous forecast of 3-4% growth. The tourism sector also takes a massive hit by terror attacks. Since the beginning of the twenty-first century, terrorism has been on the rise. There has been a five-fold increase in terror-related deaths since 2000. Terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 , in New York, Bali bombings in 2002 , 2004 Jakarta bombings, 2005 London bombings, 2006 Egypt bombings, 2008 Mumbai attacks, 2013 Nairobi armed assault, 2015 November Paris attacks, 2016 March Brussel attacks, 2016 Nice attack, March 2017 London attack, 2019 Sri Lanka attacks are only some of the terrorist incidents that the world has witnessed. Buckelew (1984, p. 18 ) defines terrorism as \"Violent, criminal behaviour designed primarily to generate fear in the community, or in a substantial segment of the community, for political purposes.\" Based on Buckelew's definition, it could be said that the fundamental purpose of terrorism is to inspire fear so that people change their behavior. In most of the terrorist attacks, tourist destinations are the main target. The reason behind this is to use tourists as a political tool to attract more media coverage.",

As for the epidemics, it takes relatively longer, 21 months, to bounce back from an epidemic. However, the situation might be different for Turkey as the country has suffered several attacks in the last two decades. Tourism losses have a substantial impact on Turkey's economy, where tourism constitutes a significant share (20%) of total exports. Given the importance of tourism in Turkey's economy, analyzing the determinants of tourism demand in Turkey is an appealing research area. Turkey has several distinct features that make the country an essential venue for study. Firstly, Turkey is an excellent case to analyze as the country hosted 51.2 million tourists in 2019, which gave it a sixth spot in the world rankings. Understanding the dynamics of tourism demand in Turkey plays an important role in achieving sustainable tourism. The results obtained from this study may also provide hints for other countries.",

Therefore, we analyze the determinants of tourism demand in Turkey in a multivariate framework incorporating globalization and terrorism. Turkey is the only country in the top ten tourist destinations consistently and severely suffering from terrorism/violence. In his book published in 1984, Buckelew stated that Turkey had managed to bring endemic terrorism under control. As opposed to the author's statement, the country has been fighting terrorism for nearly 40 years. On the other hand, globalization has become the main driver of the tourism sector since it integrates countries through economic, societal, and cultural aspects and enables them to get in touch more closely . Given the pivotal role of globalization in the tourism sector, one may consider Turkey as one of the most globalized countries because the globalization performance of the country has been over the world average globalization level since the 1970s (Bilgili et al. 2020) .",

The results of the study confirm the existence of the hypothesis that \"the frequency of acts of terrorism cause a larger decline in international tourist arrivals than the severity of these acts.\" An important implication of the study is that tourism destinations could recover from even severe terror incidents so long as the incidents are not repeated. Drakos and Kutan (2003) developed a consumer-choice model to investigate the regional effects of terrorism. This study employed monthly data from 1991:01 to 2000:12 for Greece, Israel, and Turkey. In addition to the harmful effects of terrorism on tourism, the authors found evidence of substitution between countries as tourism destinations if one appears safer than the other. An essential finding of the study regarding Turkey is that Turkey's tourism market share dropped by 5.21% as a result of terror incidents between 1991 and 2001.",

Therefore, a third option in controlling unit root properties of variables is to use Fourier approximation that allows capturing known and unknown breaks through the use of low-frequency components (Enders and Lee 2012a, b; Rodrigues and Taylor 2012) . In this process of Fourier approximation, known and unknown structures of breaks are regarded through Eq.

According to the results, an increase in the income level of visitors increase the number of tourist arrivals by 2.258%, which confirms the theoretical expectation that tourists respond to income rise by increasing their demand for tourism. Similarly, rises in relative price and relative exchange rate as well, which are essential determinants for both the purchasing powers of foreign visitors and destination preferences, increase the number of tourist arrivals. However, one may conclude that terrorism matters for the tourism sector in Turkey since it has a detrimental impact on tourist arrivals, and the coefficient of terrorism with a negative sign is higher than those of other regressors in the estimation. Results on the role of terrorism in the tourism sector are in line with findings of Bhattarai et al. (2005) , Drakos and Kutan (2003) , Llorca-Vivero (2008) , Thompson (2011 , Yap and Saha (2013) , Yaya (2009) , among others. On the other hand, some discussion points arise for Turkey to underline threats in the tourism sector in terms of terror attacks. Accordingly, the well-known hypothesis recalls that \"the frequency of acts of terrorism cause a larger decline in international tourist arrivals than the severity of these acts.\" Turkey is almost subjected to daily terror attacks as can be verified by daily data of the Global Terrorism Database. Although a vast majority of them targeted military or police powers in the southeast region, which is far from major tourist destinations of the country, these attacks may create a considerable uncertainty or may be a robust dissuading factor for visitor decisions in choosing Turkey. One may claim that tourist arrivals to Turkey have increased over time despite terror attacks, but this claim should be justified by revealing and comparing potential and available tourist numbers. In parallel with this argument, Yaya (2009) examined the effect of terrorism on the number of tourist arrivals to Turkey using monthly data 1997:01-2006:12. The findings of the study show that there exists a negative but relatively small impact of terrorism on tourism. However, our results show that terror attacks are the most influenced factor affecting tourist arrivals.",

However, countries may not increase tourism receipts in parallel with the increase of arrivals since tourists may prefer not to get out of hotels with full service during their vacations which are made especially for summer holidays due to the probability of any victimization. So, this may be an alternative explanation of why Turkey is not ranked within the top ten countries by tourism receipts even though it always takes part in the most visited ten countries (see Table 6 .1). This discussion is in line with the findings of Montes and Bernab\u00e9 (2020) , showing that tourists from developed countries are more sensitive to violence than developing countries. More specifically, they found that every death as a result of violence in Rio de Janeiro scares away almost four tourists from developed countries and three tourists from developing countries.

            "text": "The tourism sector is a major source of employment, government revenue, and foreign currency for many economies since it provides a considerable employment opportunity and creates a huge demand for domestic products. However, it is affected by many variables that increase or decrease the number of visitors and/or tourism receipts and needs to be well managed to get its potential benefits and increase economic added values from tourism. To this end, the impacts of driving factors and their roles in shaping tourism policies should be well investigated and revealed in detail. Turkey is an emerging economy in which the tourism sector has a significant share and needs to improve gains from tourism, given its tourism potential. On the other hand, it suffers from a chronic terror problem that should be emergently solved, which constrains the further expansion of the tourism sector. To reveal how tourist arrivals react to terror attacks in Turkey, this study investigates the effects of globalization and terrorism on tourist arrivals by using yearly data covering the period 1980-2018 through time series econometric methods. Firstly, stationarity conditions of time series data used in the study were tested through Fourier unit root tests that allow known and unknown breaks, and then the cointegration relationship was confirmed by the Fourier cointegration approach. Finally, FMOLS and DOLS estimators were carried out to get long-run cointegration parameters that show how 1% change in the related variable would affect the response variable. Empirical findings indicate that terror attacks have a detrimental effect on tourist arrivals, while globalization, relative prices, and exchange rate, foreign income have a positive influence on the tourism sector. Combining the facts and empirical results, the study provides valuable insights and discussion points for the tourism sector in Turkey. For instance, Turkey cannot reach the potential tourism gains despite its visitor numbers, and visitors are highly sensitive to terror attacks, as is verified by our findings. Also, research reveals that visitors who may spend more money from advanced or high-income countries are more vulnerable to terror attacks than other visitors coming from developing or lowincome countries. Besides, it is accepted that the frequency of terror attacks has a more significant negative impact on tourist arrivals than the severity of these acts. Therefore, terrorism is one of the most important problems in the tourism sector in Turkey. Policymakers should focus on not only military or security purposes in combating terrorism but also, they realize the potential economic loss from the tourism sector due to terror attacks and spend more efforts to convince all agents to struggle with violence and terrorism firstly. On the other hand, results suggest that global integration helps shape the tourism sector, and it leads to an increase in the number of tourist arrivals that may also result in more gains from the tourism sector. So, policymakers should expand the integration level by also designing good relationships with other countries to get more benefits and gains from the sector.",
