            "text": "The increasing implementation of and reliance on machine-learning (ML) algorithms to perform tasks, deliver services and make decisions in health and healthcare have made the need for fairness in ML, and more specifically in healthcare ML algorithms (HMLA), a very important and urgent task. However, while the debate on fairness in the ethics of artificial intelligence (AI) and in HMLA has grown significantly over the last decade, the very concept of fairness as an ethical value has not yet been sufficiently explored. Our paper aims to fill this gap and address the AI ethics principle of fairness from a conceptual standpoint, drawing insights from accounts of fairness elaborated in moral philosophy and using them to conceptualise fairness as an ethical value and to redefine fairness in HMLA accordingly. To achieve our goal, following a first section aimed at clarifying the background, methodology and structure of the paper, in the second section, we provide an overview of the discussion of the AI ethics principle of fairness in HMLA and show that the concept of fairness underlying this debate is framed in purely distributive terms and overlaps with non-discrimination, which is defined in turn as the absence of biases. After showing that this framing is inadequate, in the third section, we pursue an ethical inquiry into the concept of fairness and argue that fairness ought to be conceived of as an ethical value. Following a clarification of the relationship between fairness and non-discrimination, we show that the two do not overlap and that fairness requires much more than just non-discrimination. Moreover, we highlight that fairness not only has a distributive but also a socio-relational dimension. Finally, we pinpoint the constitutive components of fairness. In doing so, we base our arguments on a renewed reflection on the concept of respect, which goes beyond the idea of equal respect to include respect for individual persons. In the fourth section, we analyse the implications of our conceptual redefinition of fairness as an ethical value in the discussion of fairness in HMLA. Here, we claim that fairness requires more than non-discrimination and the absence of biases as well as more than just distribution; it needs to ensure that HMLA respects persons both as persons and as particular individuals. Finally, in the fifth section, we sketch some broader implications and show how our inquiry can contribute to making HMLA and, more generally, AI promote the social good and a fairer society.",

In this scenario, the Covid-19 pandemic has made the topic even more urgent: in fact, it has sped up the design and use of novel solutions based on ML for many health-related services, such as health population monitoring (e.g. contact tracing apps), remote assistance and homecare (e.g. telemedicine), and hospitalsand-care access management in response to clinics' overload. This increasing deployment of and reliance on ML algorithms that are trained mainly on patients' personal data to make decisions on health and healthcare have been uncovered as beneficial in terms of health research, operational efficiency, healthcare resources' management and waste reduction, but also as potentially harmful to the promotion of fairness. A recent example of the latter concern is the ML-based software that was applied in thousands of hospitals in the United States of America (US) that runs access to specially resourced care programmes. It has been found to be biased and to reify social disparities, favouring White patients over sicker Black patients in determining patients-in-need priority scores due to an erroneous use of past medical expenditures, which are historically lower among Black patients, as a proxy for determining access to extra medical support (Obermeyer et al. 2019) .",

At the end of the section, we question whether the concept of fairness so understood is adequate for the discussion of fairness in HMLA or whether the latter calls for a more complex concept of fairness that requires more than just non-discrimination and an exclusively distributive dimension, and that includes features and criteria that extend beyond the consideration of biases.",

Moreover, we highlight that fairness not only has a distributive but also a sociorelational dimension. Finally, we pinpoint the constitutive components of fairness. In doing so, we base our arguments on a renewed reflection on the concept of respect, which goes beyond the idea of equal respect to include respect for individual persons.",

However, because of their complex architectural features, they can easily lead to a lack of transparency and tend to turn into an opaque black box (Pasquale 2015); therefore, auditing and the correction of flaws such as biases and technical inaccuracies is an extremely challenging task to perform, even when ML algorithms' secret trade can be disclosed.",

            "text": "Most of the current scholarship acknowledges the production of unfair outcomes due to biases as one of the main concerns related to ML (Grote and Berens 2020; Morley et al. 2020 ) and argues that ML systems, rather than simply guarding against these harms passively, should be used proactively to advance ML algorithmic fairness in healthcare (Rajkomar et al. 2018) . To this aim, a growing corpus of (mostly technical) literature has been focusing on detecting and fixing biases in HMLA, insofar as biases are deemed to be the main cause of health unfairness (Rajkomar et al. 2018; Char 2018; Obermeyer et al. 2019) , and the latter is in turn understood mainly as algorithmic discrimination (Angwin et al. 2016; Hardt et al. 2016) . 1 Algorithmic discrimination is usually understood as the production of discrimination (O'Neil 2016; Noble 2018; Eubanks 2018; Benjamin 2019) in the consideration or treatment of members of protected groups or categories; this discrimination is mostly traced back to the presence of 'automation bias' and 'bias by proxy' in ML algorithmic models. Automation bias is the large-scale spread through ML processes of social and cultural biases that are deeply embedded in the historical training data used to fuel ML algorithms (Hu 2017; Turner Lee, 2018; Noble, 2018; Benjamin, 2019; Richardson et al. 2019; Abebe et al. 2020) . Bias by proxy occurs when unanticipated proxies for protected variables (gender, race, etc.) can still be used to reconstruct and infer, by proxy, biases that are highly difficult to detect and eliminate, even though an attempt was made to prevent some biases by excluding them from the historical data used to train the ML model (Fuster et al. 2017; Gillis and Spiess 2019) . This operationalisation of fairness as non-discrimination via non-biased ML models is evident when considering the most prominent methods to ensure fairness in algorithmic decision-making and ML, which today consist of 'discrimination prevention analytics and strategies' (Romei and Ruggeri 2014) and 'fairness-and discrimination-aware data mining techniques' (Dwork et al. 2011; Kamishima et al. 2012) . These methods are based on the technical engineering of anti-discrimination criteria, their integration into the ML classifier and on the control of the distortion of data used to train the algorithms; they also emerge from the main initiatives on fairness in ML in the industry (Ochigame 2019) .",

This is because in the specific corpus of literature still being developed on healthcare and ML, the underlying concept of fairness emerges mainly as an absence of biases leading to discrimination, and discrimination in turn is understood mostly-if not exclusively-as intertwined with distributive issues (Obermeyer et al. 2019; McCradden et al. 2020; Corbett-Davies and Goel, 2018; Benjamin 2019; Friedler et al. 2016; Barocas, 2014; Kleinberg et al. 2017 ).

However, this understanding of fairness has been criticised for relying excessively on technical parity and dataset neutrality that is achievable via the elimination of references to protected groups' identities (McCradden et al. 2019) and for not always providing the best techniques to achieve fairness in HMLA. In fact, in the health domain, the integration of differences between identities is appropriate because there is a reasonable presumption of causation (McCradden et al. 2020) , as in the case of biological differences between genders that can affect the efficacy of pharmacological compounds. Omitting variables such as gender and race can diminish accuracy and exacerbate discrimination, instead of mitigating it, while the presence of sensitive attributes can allow HMLA to disclose differently biased correlations, and therefore, help HMLA's designers to develop auditing meta-algorithms that, as they are trained on them, can work for their correction. As in the case of HMLA for health programmes' enrolment (Obermeyer et al. 2019) , the removal of sensitive attributes neither prevents the development of biased HMLA nor implies the design of fair HMLA.",

Among the negative factors determining health insurance rates, as well as access to subsidised care programmes, is whether the subject is a smoker. As smoking is recognised as the cause of many diseases, the subject is evaluated by HMLA as being likelier to incur by choice in more medical expenses. On the basis of this correlation, the HMLA may evaluate the subject as not being in financial need, in charge (by choice) of more medical costs, and if ill, with a lower probability of healing from a specific disease. This may cause the subject to experience higher insurance rates or exclude or place her at the bottom of waiting lists for accessing subsidised health programmes, as she is evaluated with no economic priority and, as a smoker, also less entitled to it from both a medical and social standpoint. However, this correlation using a neutral connotator, such as smoking, is not effectively neutral and can reinforce disparities, although cleaned by references to sensitive connotators. Smoking is particularly diffuse, especially in the US, among those living in degrading and harsh socio-economic conditions, where access to health treatments, programmes or insurances is already deeply compromised. As a consequence, this correlation, if fixed, can lead to the design of HMLAs that perpetuate and reinforce, instead of mitigate, existing disparities.",

The general idea underpinning these works is that wrongful discrimination is connected to moral disrespect-that is, disrespect for the discriminatees as persons (Eidelson 2015, p. 6 ). More precisely, an action is discriminatory if either the reasons underlying the action or the consequences brought about by the action do not respect the status of an agent as equal. In other words, it is 'the absence of appropriate responsiveness to someone's standing as a person' (Eidelson 2015, p . 7) that underpins moral disrespect and wrongful discrimination. The moral respect at stake here can best be captured by referring to the notion of recognition respect elaborated by Darwall (1977) : respect grounded in the recognition of the (equal) humanity of every person. 6 Highlighting the ethical significance of discrimination helps shed light on the ethical import of the relationship between discrimination and fairness: discrimination emerges as a moral wrong that shows disrespect for people in as far as it denies their standing as persons; that is, their moral equality. Denying someone's moral equality prevents mutual recognition as equals and fosters unequal treatment. It follows that the moral wrong of discrimination can prevent fairness in at least two ways: first, by having an impact at a sociorelational level, in that it creates a society of unequals, where people do not respect one another as (equal) persons, as they do not recognise each other as (equal) persons; second, by having an impact at a distributive level, by legitimising an unfair distribution 7 that can become structural. 8 As for fairness, ethical inquiry has mainly been aimed at investigating the basis of moral equality that fairness ought to ensure (Waldron 2017; Carter 2011; Sangiovanni 2017) , rather than at discussing the ethical significance of fairness as such. A widespread idea is that moral equality can be guaranteed through fair distribution; the latter, in turn, would require compliance with the principle of 'fair equality of opportunity' and a 'difference principle' (Rawls 1971) . Both principles regulate the distribution of benefits and burdens of social cooperation, but while the former prescribes arranging socio-economic inequalities in such ways that are not influenced by morally arbitrary factors and rather enable everyone's personal agency and self-realisation (Rawls 1971, p. 73) , the latter requires that-once the former principle is guaranteed-the overall scheme of cooperation and distribution does not discriminate against the (expectations of the) worst off.",

            "text": "The emphasis on the distributive dimension of fairness has led some scholars-labelled as luck egalitarians 4 Foundational questions about discrimination are familiar to legal scholars, too, and in recent years, in particular, there has been a renewed interest in philosophical questions about anti-discrimination law (Khaitan 2015; Hellman and Moreau 2013 ) aimed mainly at defining under what conditions discrimination ought to be prohibited. The focus of these inquiries, however, is on discrimination rather than on the relationship between discrimination and fairness. 5 However, drawing on Dworkin (2000) , Waldron (2017, p. 14) acknowledges that not every discrimination is wrongful; in fact, there might also be forms of unequal treatment or 'surface-level' discrimination that do not imply any moral wrongdoing, but rather are justifiable by an appeal to the whole range of human interests, as in the case, discussed by Waldron, of firefighters being selected for their physical fitness. 6 Darwall (1977) introduces the well-known distinction between recognition respect and appraisal respect, whereby the latter depends on the appraisal of a person's character. Darwall's account of recognition respect has been further elaborated on by Carter (2011) , who develops the notion of 'opacity-respect'; that is, recognition respect expressed through the idea that we have to treat every person as 'opaque', respecting them on the footing of moral equality, without engaging in an assessment of their personal merits or demerits (Carter 2011). 7 The question remains open regarding what ought to be distributed, such as with resources, opportunities or outcomes. This is the wellknown issue of the 'metrics' or 'currency' of justice: for an overview, see Brighouse and Robeyns (2010) . 8 Just to mention one of the most problematic cases, consider racial injustice; it is historically rooted, socially shaped and institutionally entrenched in distributive policies: see Shelby (2016) , Kelly (2017) . (Anderson 1999) -to claim that fairness requires treating people as equals by considering individual choices and their effects on distribution. In this view, distribution, to be fair, ought to be 'ambition-sensitive' (or choice-or responsibility-sensitive) and 'endowment-insensitive'. The former condition requires that distribution depend on choices made by individuals in ways that reflect their option luck, whereas the latter condition requires that distribution does not depend on differential brute luck. Brute luck is fortune, over which individuals have no control, while option luck is the upshot of risks that were, in some sense, deliberately taken and for which individuals have responsibility. 9 However, luck egalitarian accounts have been criticised for being too harsh in as far as they would eventually lead to abandoning the so-called 'negligent victims', or those who would end up in a bad situation due to the risks they had deliberately taken. This abandonment, it has been claimed, would be deeply disrespectful of persons (Anderson 1999; Scheffler 2003; Wolff 1998 Wolff , 2010 , as it would ultimately clash with the acknowledgement of every person's moral equality. Moreover, it would not only have a discriminating impact at the distributive level towards the 'negligent victims', but it would also bring about socio-relational inequalities, as the 'negligent victims' would be looked at as less valuable citizens, not deserving equal respect, due to the choices they made.",

In this view, as already noted, fairness is aimed at the creation of a society of equals where no wrongful discrimination occurs. However, if we dig deeper into the socio-relational dimension of fairness, we find that it requires more than this kind of non-discrimination: it also requires guaranteeing everyone an equal 'right to justification' (Forst 2014) . The right to justification expresses the ethical demand that no 'relations should exist that cannot be adequately justified towards those involved' (Forst 2014, p. 6) ; it points to the need for intersubjective relations and structures that do not discriminate against anyone, protect every person's status of an equal and express (equal) respect for the equal moral worth of every person.",

It seems that if we are truly serious about respecting persons, we ought to respect them not only as instances of rational agency, but also as the particular individuals that they are' (Noggle 1999, p. 454) .

While fair equality of opportunity, the difference principle and the right to justification are grounded in the acknowledgement of the equal moral worth of every person and require a commitment to ensure equal respect for persons as persons, their effective implementation depends on many factors that affect people's conditions and prospects in life. They also have an impact on their capability to make up their own minds as well as on the opportunities that they have, in ways that vary from individual to individual.

We also questioned whether the definition of a fair HMLA as bias-free HMLA emerging from the literature is enough to promote fairness via AI, specifically HMLA in healthcare, or whether a more complex account of fairness is needed. In Sect. 3, we showed that an ethical inquiry into the concept of fairness can help us to adequately elaborate the ethics principle of fairness and clarify that fairness neither overlaps with non-discrimination nor only has a distributive component but rather entails the consideration of both a distributive and a socio-relational dimension. Specifically, we argued that fairness is an ethical value entailing three components, all grounded in the need to respect persons both as persons and as particular individuals: fair equality of opportunity, difference principle and equal right to justification.",

However, as we have shown, it has been understood and used only in a narrow sense, as being aimed at preventing discrimination through distribution; the underlying idea is that non-discrimination is ensured by HMLA if HMLA guarantee an equal allocation of outcomes, performances or resources (i.e. demographic parity) for protected and nonprotected groups. Moreover, this condition is satisfied via solutions mainly coinciding with parity models (Hardt et al. 2019; Corbett-Davies and Goel, 2018; Rajkomar et al. 2018; Friedler et al. 2016) designed to produce nondiscriminatory predictions by eliminating references to protected groups' identities, such as sensitive attributes like race or gender (McCradden et al. 2020) . However, as argued in the previous sections, the focus on non-discrimination, pursued through the removal of sensitive attributes and the pursuit of neutral or parity models, does not lead to fairness in HMLA and can sometimes even perpetuate and reinforce wrongful discrimination and existing disparities. However, if the removal of specific attributes and the use of neutral models per se do not promote fair equality of opportunity, what does fair equality of opportunity require when applied to promote fairness in HMLA?",

It is now clearer why neither the development of neutral and parity models for HMLA nor the ML's labelling or categorisation of people in groups on the basis of standard or macrogeneralised attributes can foster fairness; rather, they can obscure some crucial differences, whose non-consideration is critical from both a medical and social standpoint and can deeply undermine the respect for persons, both as persons and as particular individuals, who as such are situated in deeply different socio-economic contexts. Fair equality of opportunity and the difference principle require that HMLA are informed with sensitive traits (gender, age and race) to the extent that they can play as decisional nodes to evaluate who in a certain health domain may require compensatory tools (i.e. the implementation of extra health measures, support or facilities) if explicitly requested by the subject. The 'explicitly' clause is crucial, as not every person, although a member of a protected group per antonomasia, would really need or be willing to be defined as such. For example, an elderly person may require further assistance to access a programme whose application procedure is only online, or she may not; in both cases, the person, ignored in her need or considered vulnerable when she is not, if unheard, can feel differently treated and not properly recognised as the particular individual she is. For this reason, as we will argue below, HMLA should also inform the patient, subject to their decision about the profile or label they have been assigned (e.g. if they are evaluated as belonging to a certain group and why), and consequently intervene, displaying compensatory options when explicitly asked or properly recognised by HMLA. In this way, HMLA would put the person in the position to participate in the specific modelling and alignment of the profile assigned to her with the particular individual (with specific needs, features and ground project) that she is.",

They can also intervene via, for example, not-profilable semi-structured interviews, while implementing at the same time meta-algorithms capable of detecting and fixing pernicious biases reflecting historical inequalities arising from them.",

            "text": "Moreover, as argued in Sect. 3, fairness as an ethical value entails a socio-relational dimension; this means that an equal right to justification is the third condition that ought to be ensured and implemented by a fair HMLA. The equal right to justification expresses the ethical demand that every person be respected as a subject who can offer and demand justification. As introduced via the formulation of the 'explicitly' clause, to promote fairness via HMLA, individuals should be recognised as the particular individuals that they are, with specific needs, vulnerabilities and ground projects. This is fundamental not only for the promotion of a society of equals regarding the distribution of opportunities, but also for the creation of a society of individuals who feel recognised in their voices and actions and are able to effectively understand how their chances and choices are influenced by HMLA. In particular, the right to justification requires that every person has the right to demand justification for the HMLA treatment (from decision to prediction) she is subjected to, not just in output but also in input and process. Therefore, ensuring an equal right to justification in HMLA entails that designers have a duty to take this demand into account in ways that are accessible to the subjects involved. Respecting the equal right to justification does not imply full transparency, as the latter is often unnecessary for a sufficient or adequate explanation to users; rather, it requires informing the patients about information as input and correlations as reasons leading to the development of a certain profile of them on the basis of which persons are subjected to certain decisions, such as having access or not to certain health facilities or a more or less high health insurance rate. This is of particular importance for at least two reasons. First, it would allow patients to ask for reasons for and eventually contest the outcomes/decisions they are subjected to and to ask for changes. This is crucial, as the current opacity characterising HMLA's functioning and, therefore patients' treatment constitutes an asymmetry of power, both in knowledge and in action between those that can be wrongly considered and those who are behind the HMLAs' design, use and deployment. Therefore, ensuring an equal right to justification would effectively mitigate asymmetries of power related to the question of who decides what. Second, it would allow patients to act against the epistemic injustice 11 that HMLA can produce. Indeed, by undermining 11 The issue of epistemic injustice was first extensively discussed by Fricker (2007) , who distinguishes two forms: testimonial injustice and hermeneutical injustice. The former occurs when a speaker the subject in knowledge, those who are unfairly treated are undermined in their position to participate in the modelling of HMLA as novel health determinants. As HMLA are increasingly applied to manage crucial tasks and services in healthcare, the silencing and exclusion of segments of populations from contesting and asking for revisions of HMLA means hindering fairness in as far as it concerns the promotion of a society of equals, where everyone ought to have an equal opportunity to participate in the processes of defining the (technological) structures that shape society.",

For example, distribution-related questions might be more pressing in countries that have more progressive welfare states, and there they would be tackled at the policy rather than business or provider level; this would imply that people expect institutions rather than the market to distribute access to healthcare fairly and that institutions-rather than the market-are held responsible for such a distribution and for the tools and methods of distribution to be fair. At the same time, people's real opportunities to access the distribution of healthcare fairly are strongly influenced not only by the political or economic setting but also by a wide range of factors that are socially or historically determined. In this regard, uncovering discrimination and biases in HMLA, making people aware of these discrimination and biases, and designing and implementing fair HMLA in ways that include those suggested in our paper may contribute to shedding light not only on the conditions for a fair distribution of healthcare through HMLA but also on the threats and opportunities of any distributive tool or methods.",

In particular, we argued that fairness as an ethical value has both a distributive and a socio-relational dimension and comprises three components: fair equality of opportunity, difference principle and equal right to justification. Finally, we analysed the implications of our conceptual redefinition of fairness as an ethical value in the discussion of fairness in HMLA and highlighted specific areas where further work needs to be done to operationalise fairness in HMLA. We claimed that an ethically informed principle of fairness requires ensuring that HMLA are designed and applied in compliance with fair equality of opportunity, the difference principle and the equal right to justification in ways that respect persons both as persons and as particular individuals and that acknowledge both the distributive and the socio-relational dimension of fairness. By doing so, we invite future research to not only focus on anti-discrimination and bias removal techniques but also to develop novel technical and policy-oriented tools and methods that can promote the fundamental components and dimensions of fairness, and therefore, effectively implement the AI ethics principle of fairness in HMLA.",
