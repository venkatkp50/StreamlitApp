Cardiovascular diseases, kidney damage and neuropathy are the main cause of high mortality rates among individuals with diabetes. One effective therapeutic approach for controlling hyperglycemia associated with type-2 diabetes is to target alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase, enzymes that catalyzes starch hydrolysis in the intestine. At present, approved inhibitors for these enzymes are restricted to acarbose, miglitol and voglibose. Although these inhibitors retard glucose absorption, undesirable gastrointestinal side effects impede their application. Therefore, research efforts continue to seek novel inhibitors with improved efficacy and minimal side effects. Natural products of plant origin have been a valuable source of therapeutic agents with lesser toxicity and side effects. The anti-diabetic potential through alpha-glucosidase inhibition of plant-derived molecules are summarized in this review. Eight molecules (Taxumariene F, Akebonoic acid, Morusin, Rhaponticin, Procyanidin A2, Alaternin, Mulberrofuran K and Psoralidin) were selected as promising drug candidates and their pharmacokinetic properties and toxicity were discussed where available.",

            "text": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is an endocrine metabolic disorder characterized by abnormal levels of glucose in the blood stream (Alrefai et al. 2002) . Owing to the unhealthy lifestyle activities, the global prevalence of diabetes is rising and the number of diabetes cases is projected to reach 578 million cases by the year 2030 (Saeedi et al. 2019 ). Insulin, a peptide hormone produced by the pancreatic b-cells, plays a key role in the regulation of blood glucose levels and energy metabolism. It is essential for a myriad of cellular functions including glucose uptake and transport, glycogen synthesis, fatty acid synthesis and protein synthesis. Insufficient production of insulin or insulin resistance impair the normal glucose homeostasis, which eventually lead to hyperglycemia (Wilcox 2005) . Chronic hyperglycemia can result in serious long-term complications including nerve damage, cardiovascular disease and kidney failure (Tripathi and Srivastava 2006) . Diabetes can be classified into two broad categories; type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes, also known as insulin-dependent diabetes, is one of the most common metabolic disorders occurring in childhood (Atkinson et al. 2014 ). The pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes involves T-cell mediated autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic beta-cells that produce insulin. Subsequently, this leads to a deficiency of insulin secretion in the body, resulting in the onset of the disease (Simmons and Michels 2015) . On the other hand, type 2 diabetes is the most prevalent form of diabetes, comprising 90-95% of all the cases (Fan 2017) . This form of diabetes is caused by a combination of insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion (Watada and Tamura 2017) . The insensitivity of the target tissues to insulin can be manifested by the failure of glucose uptake in the skeletal muscle cells, and also due to the increased formation of glucose in the liver (Ormazabal et al. 2018) . The major risk factors associated with the onset and the aggravation of type 2 diabetes include obesity, physical inactivity and vitamin D deficiency (Wu et al. 2014b) .",

In this vein, several pharmacological approaches have been used to control hyperglycemia which is the major cause of diabetes complications. Treatments often include insulin injection for patients of type I diabetes or oral medications combined with lifestyle changes for the management of type 2 diabetes (Aziz 2012) . The therapeutic intervention using non-insulin medications is based on reversing the pathophysiological abnormalities that contribute to hyperglycemia (Chatterjee and Davies 2015) . In other words, such drugs hinder glucose absorption, suppress hepatic gluconeogenesis and inhibit renal reabsorption of glucose. Examples of common anti-diabetic drugs that promote the aforementioned effects include alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, metformin and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors (Bhowmick and Banu 2017) . However, despite their prominent role in attenuating blood glucose levels, the adverse effects associated with these drugs are inevitable.",

(2018) reviewed the alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity of more than 280 natural and synthetic plant-derived xanthones and highlighted the importance of these molecules in the development of anti-diabetic agents. In the current review, published work related to alphaglucosidase inhibitors of plant origin between the years 2015-2020 were collected using various electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus and Science Direct. The search terms used to collect the relevant papers involved a combination of ''alphaglucosidase'' with either ''plant extracts'' or with each of the chemical classes and subclasses presented in this review. Those studies that examined the alphaglucosidase inhibitory activities of synthetic and nonplant derived compounds (e.g. microorganisms) were excluded from the study. This review primarily discussed the in vitro alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activities of different plant extracts and specific molecules along with their biological activities, pharmacokinetic properties and toxicity. The search resulted in identifying 290 chemically diverse molecules exhibiting in vitro alpha-glucosidase inhibition. MarvinSketch software (version 20.15, ChemAxon, Budapest, Hungary) was used to draw the chemical structures of the reported bioactive compounds. Eight molecules were identified as promising candidates for future research on type 2-diabetes drug discovery. The Fig. 1 Acarbose, miglitol and voglibose structures selection was based on the following criteria: (1) the inhibitory efficiency compared to the positive controls, and (2) the variability in the chemical structure and plant origin. Selected compounds were further discussed with respect to other bioactivities of pharmaceutical importance, pharmacokinetic properties and toxicity profiles.",

The digestion process begins with the secretion of amylases (EC 3.2.1.1) produced mainly by the pancreatic and salivary glands and catalyze the hydrolysis of starch into shorter polysaccharides (Mandel and Breslin 2012) . The acidic environment of the stomach inhibits the enzymatic activity of the salivary amylase, which will hinder further breakdown of starch. Upon entry into the small intestine, partially hydrolyzed starch is further converted by the pancreatic amylases which targets the a-1,4 bonds of the carbohydrate releasing dextrins (des Gachons and Breslin 2016). The final step in carbohydrates metabolism is mediated by alpha-glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.20) in the brush border of the enterocytes. The enzymes contain duplicated glycoside hydrolases (GH31) domains and they catalyze the hydrolysis of a-glucosidic linkages of disaccharides and oligosaccharides (Jongkees and Withers 2014; Lombard et al. 2014) . Reports have shown that alpha-glucosidase was 1.5-fold overexpressed in noninsulin-dependent diabetes patients contributing to the increase in postprandial glucose levels (Dyer et al. 2002) .",

The inhibition of alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase activity can therefore retard glucose liberation from complex carbohydrates modulating the onset of postprandial hyperglycemia, thereby rendering it an ideal target for the management of type 2 diabetes. Alpha-amylase inhibitors are mainly present in plants and the most studied molecules are glycoproteins isolated from kidney beans (Phase 2 \u00d2 product) (reviewed in Barrett and Udani 2011) . The most commonly prescribed alpha-glucosidase inhibitor is acarbose and it is a pseudo-carbohydrate isolated from actinomycetes (Luo et al. 2001) . Other available inhibitors include, voglibose (from microbial origin) and miglitol (derived synthetically from 1-deoxynojirimycin) (Tan et al. 2018) . The structural resemblance of these drugs with carbohydrates promote their attachment to the binding site of alpha-glucosidase enzyme. A recent in silico study found that these inhibitors interact with different residues of the enzyme including Phe178, Phe303, His280, His351, Arg315, Arg442 and Tyr158 (Ernawati et al. 2018 ). Acarbose, a pseudo-tetrasaccharide consisting of a valienol moiety linked via nitrogen to isomaltotriose. This molecule has a 10 4 to 10 5 times higher affinity for alpha-glucosidases compared to natural oligosaccharides and competitively inhibits this enzyme (Rosak and Mertes 2012) . The binding affinity of acarbose to the enzyme is much higher than the normal sugar substrates due to hydrogen bond formation between ASP 568 and the hydrogen atom of the amine group (Abuelizz et al. 2019) .",

The colorimetric-based quantitative method is among the most common and practical approaches that has been utilized for the verification of the inhibitory role of different compounds against alpha-glucosidase enzyme. This method is based on the measurement of the quantity of p-nitrophenol (pNP) released when p-nitrophenyl-a-D-glucopyranoside (pNPG) is hydrolyzed by alpha-glucosidase enzyme. This is followed by measuring spectrophotomerically the absorbance of the formed product which is characterized by a yellow color at 400 nm (Zhang et al. 2019) . Another assay commonly used for the detection of alphaglucosidase activity is the colorimetric/fluorometric glucose oxidase assay which allows the detection and quantification of glucose released in the reaction.",

The majority of studies in this review assessed bioactivity of molecules using alphaglucosidase enzyme isolated from yeast and used pNPG as a substrate. Additionally, different reference compounds have been utilized in the evaluation of the alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity of the various plant-derived compounds including acarbose, quercetin and 1-deoxynojirimycin. Although acarbose was the most commonly used positive standard, the reported IC 50 values for this inhibitor varied widely and fell in the range of 0.0013-1998.79 lM (Tables 1  and 2 , online resource 1). The great variability in the obtained IC 50 values for acarbose can be attributed to the different experimental conditions employed such as the enzyme source, the enzyme and substrate concentrations and the incubation times and temperatures. One consequence to that is the difficulty in interpreting results obtained from seperate papers and comparing bioactivities. The effect of the different experimental conditions and the various enzymes used on the sensitivity of the assay need to be assessed leading to a standardization of the protocol used.",

However, the active phytochemicals responsible for the observed alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity are still to be identified. The oral administration of Chrysophyllum caimito at a dose of 75 mg/kg of body weight was found to significantly decrease sugar blood level in diabetic rats (Arrijal et al. 2018) . Safety investigation have shown that the ingestion of leaves was safe and did not cause changes in the weight of the studied animals (Shailajan and Gurjar 2014) . Similarly, Ensete superbum has been reported to cause no death and no signs of acute toxicity at doses of 2000 mg/kg (Ganesan and Natesan 2017) .

For example, ethanol used to extract polar molecules, while petroleum ether is appropriate for the extraction of non-polar compounds (Snehlata et al. 2018) . For instance, the ethanolic extract (IC 50 = 0.027 mg/mL) of Adenosma bracteosum showed a higher inhibitory activity than the aqueous extract (IC 50 = 0.043 mg/ mL). The increased activity was associated with the detection of isoscutellarein-8-O-b-D-glucopyranoside in the ethanolic extract exhibiting a ten times higher inhibitory activity against alpha-glucosidase (IC 50-= 1.40 lg/mL) compared to acarbose (Nguyen et al. 2020) . Similarly, the petroleum ether extract of Hertia cheirifolia (L.)

The oral administration of up to 2000 mg/kg of the methanol extract of Hertia cheirifolia did not produce any signs of toxicity in mice for 14 days (Bouriche et al. 2016) suggesting that extracts from this plant can also be potential candidates for the treatment of diabetes.",

The acute oral toxicity of the methanolic extract of the leaves of Annona senegalensis was examined in mice. Results showed that Annona senegalensis has no toxic effects in mice up to a dose of 5000 mg/kg (Onwusonye et al. 2014 ). The ethyl acetate fraction of Liquidambar formosana leaf extract was rich in phenolic compounds, tannins and flavonoids .

French maritime pine bark extracts have also shown potent alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity compared to green tea extract and acarbose, and procyanidin oligomers were found to be responsible for this activity (Sch\u00e4fer and H\u00f6gger 2007) . Some of the identified plants in this review exhibiting alphaglucosidase inhibitory activity are already used as food or ingredient food for thousands of years in the human diet such as the fruit (acorn) of the Quercus species (\u00d3 mez et al. 2017) and are likely to be safe candidate for the development of dietary supplements. In addition to alpha-glucosidase inhibition, whole plant preparations contain a wide range of active compounds with anti-inflammatory and antioxidative activities that can improve diabetes health outcomes. Moreover, there are evidence that the synergistic interaction between compounds present in herbal preparation can improve the bioactivity of the crude extract (Reviewed in Rasoanaivo et al. 2011) .

This molecule (IC 50 = 121.2 lM) was isolated from Teucrium mascatense and it showed an inhibitory activity against alpha-glucosidase higher than acarbose (IC 50-= 942 lM). Enzyme inhibition is thought to occur when the hydroxyl groups of this compound interact with amino acids Asp68 and Arg439 in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-glucosidase enzyme through hydrogen bonding. This compound also forms hydrogen bonding with two water molecules located at positions 1026 and 1102 and the enzyme-inhibitor intereraction resembles the interaction with the hydroxyl groups of the first sugar substrate moiety (Rizvi et al. 2019 ).

They represent the second example of natural toxoids exhibiting alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity after the six wallitaxanes (A-F) isolated from Taxus wallichiana (Dang et al. 2017) . Nevertheless, the pharmacokinetic and toxicological aspects of natural and semi-synthetic Taxus-derived compounds have been comprehensively reviewed in (Hao et al. 2018 ). The anti-cancer drugs Taxol and Taxotere for instance have dose-dependent toxicities causing myelosuppression, peripheral sensory neuropathy, allergy, and taxane resistance (Yared and Tkaczuk 2012) . A newer generation of taxane drugs (BMS-275183, milataxel, ortataxel and tesetaxel) exhibited significantly lower toxicity and hypersensitivity in preclinical and clinical studies (Flores and Saif 2013) . However, the the activity of such molecules as alphaglucosidase inhibitors was never assessed. In addition, during the lengthly development of paclitaxel and docetaxel as anti-cancer agents, experiments showed that these molecules are non-water-soluble making their delivery more challenging (Singla et al. 2002) . Through controlled drug delivery using carrier systems such as nanocarriers, liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, nanoemulsions, nanocapsules and hydrogels better cellular absorption and safety was achieved (Mahajan et al. 2015) . In addition, extensive structure modification of taxanes has proved to generate new molecules with improved therapeutic index (Hu et al. 2014) . The availability and large-scale production of these molecules is another obstacle to overcome. Taxanes accumulate in plants at very low concentrations making their extraction very costly and presenting considerable environmental concerns as their production requires massive amounts of plant biomass. To overcome taxane supply crisis chemical synthesis, plant tissue cultures and microbial fermentation methods have been used (Shankar Naik 2019). The alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity of these molecules was so far only investigated in vitro. Considering the available information of structurally similar molecules, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of taxumariene alpha-glucosidase inhibitors should be judged carefully in the process of novel drug design. The rapid development in discovering and enhancing the activities of taxane analogs as anti-cancer drugs, and the presence of online databases providing information on discovered taxanes and their properties (Murugan et al. 2015) , can significantly support research development.",

While compounds 83 and 84 showed comparable IC 50 values and low inhibitory activity, the structurally similar compound gypsogenic acid (87) exhibited significantly higher inhibition that can be attribituted to the presence of a carboxy group at positions 23. The pentacyclic triterpenoid, akebonoic acid, was also remarkably efficient with an IC 50 value of 9 lM compared to 409 lM for acarbose ( Fig. 3; Table 2 ). Pentacyclic triterpenes are bioactive triterpenoids and are natural component in many medicinal plants and food sources such as fruits and vegetables. Further investigation on the enzyme inhibition kinetics of this compound demonstrated mixed-type inhibition against a-glucosidase (K i = 7.70 lM). Akebonoic acid was found to interact with the enzyme via hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. In addition to a-glucosidase inhibition, this molecule was found to significantly increase glucose uptake in insulin resistant human liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells (Wang et al. 2007 ). The dual antidiabetic activity of akebonoic acid makes of it a promising candidate for future preclinical and clinical investigations for the treatment of diabetes.",

Following an oral administration of 16 mg/kg, morusin was rapidly absorbed and metabolized into monoglucuronidated metabolites. The maximum concentration (Cmax) was 299.12 ng/mL and occurred at Tmax of 33.33 min, with an AUC0-? of 99.28 min lg/mL and a half-life time of 370.35 min. Additionally, plasma concentration-time profiles of morusin and its metabolites displayed two peaks after oral administration which can be attributed to enterohepatic re-circulation. Concerning metabolism, morusin was subjected into extensive glucuronidation in vitro and in vivo. The glucuronidation metabolism of morusin was mediated by four enzymes namely UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A7 and UGT2B7). Majority of these enzymes are primarily expressed in the liver and intestine suggesting that these organs are the main organs that heavily contribute to morusin glucuronidation. Furthermore, morusin undergo phase I oxidative metabolism catalyzed by Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP3A5, CYP3A4 and CYP2C19). The metabolism of this molecule in the liver and intestine is an important aspect in considering it as a drug candidate. However, morusin also showed potent inhibition against the drug-metabolizing enzymes CYP450s and UGTs, including CYP3A4 which is involved in the metabolism of over 50% of clinically used drugs (Shi et al. 2016a ). Drug-drug interaction of morusin with frequently administered medication for type 2 diabetes should be therefore carefully investigated during the development of morusin-derived antidiabetic drug. The acute toxicity of morusin was also examined in vivo in mice after an intraperitoneal administration at 1.75, 5.5, 17.5, 55 mg/kg dosages (Gupta et al. 2014 ). The lethal dose (LD 50 ) of this compound was found to be 20 mg/kg.",

Among these strategies was the synthesis of a niosome system consisting of non-ionic surfactant span 60 and cholesterol utilizing a thinlayer evaporation technique (Agarwal et al. 2018) . Interestingly, the nanomorusin exhibited better water solubility and anti-cancer activity than the free form of morusin.

The oral administration of rhaponticin resulted in a lower concentration of its metabolite (Cmax = 4.06 lM) than when injected intravenously (Cmax = 21.2 lM).

Rhaponticin showed no toxic effect when given up to 2000 mg/kg in adult male Wistar rats (Shi et al. 2020) . To enhance the bioavailability of rhaponticin, Liang et al.

This biotransformation is reflected by a rapid decrease in plasma levels of rhaponticin after the iv. dose (Tmax = 10 min) and an increase in plasma concentrations of rhapontigenin (Cmax = 0.18 lg/ml) after 52 min (Zhao et al. 2012) . Interestingly, this molecule displayed potent non-competitive yeast alpha-glucosidase inhibition (80% inhibition at 19.4 lM) and the molecule was classified as weak, negative, homotropic, M-modulator (Babu et al. 2004) . It is therefore important to emphasize that the low bioavailability of rhaponticin does not necessarily mean a reduced alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity as this molecule is biotransformed to potent inhibitor following administration. However, rhapontigen showed toxic effect in murine macrophage cells after treatment for 18 h at a concentration of 10 lM (Chong et al. 2021) . Consequently, investigating the safety of this metabolite when rhaponticin is administered, as alpha-glucosidase inhibitor is essential.",

Procyanidin A2, catechin and epicatechin were the major metabolities found in the rat plasma. The maximum concentration of procyanidin A2 was reached after 30 min of administration. Moreover, procyanidin A2 displayed a rapid clearance from plasma within 1 h after PSE intake. Interestingly, unlike, epicatechin, procyanidin dimers did not undergo conjugation or methylation in vivo which can help conserve their bioactivity in the intestine (Appeldoorn et al. 2009 ). In the context of using these molecules for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, the effect of carbohydrate-rich diet on the digestibility and bioavailability of procyanidins was also investigated (Serra et al. 2010) . Dimeric and trimeric procyanidins showed high stability when exposed to gastric and intestinal digestions and very limited absorption in the small intestine. In addition, carbohydrates intake was found to enhance the uptake of procyanidin monomers. The encapsulation of procyanidin fractions from Leucosidea sericea in silver nanoparticles was found to further enhance the stability of these compounds without altering their inhibitory effect against alphaglucosidase and alpha-amylase enzymes (Badeggi et al. 2020) . The stability of the nanoformulation of procyanidins is encouraging for the development of new alpha-glucosidase inhibitor as such drug needs to resist degradation by digestive juices and intereactions with intestinal microorganisms.",

Alaternin acted as a mixed-type inhibitor against alpha-glucosidase enzyme with high affinity reflected by a Ki value of 0.66 lM. The higher inhibitory activity of alaternin was attributed to the presence of free hydroxy groups at the C-1, C-6, and C-8 positions (Jung et al. 2017 ).

Molecular docking results revealed that the hydroxyl groups of this compound bind tightly with four residues at the active site of PTP1B with negative binding energy. The over-expression of PTP1B was associated with decreased insulin sensitivity in mice and the downregulation of insulin activity (Goldstein et al. 2000; Klaman et al. 2000) . A therapeutic approach using alaternin as drug candidate that targets both, the reduction of postprandial hyperglycemia and the enhancement of insulin sensitivity can be therefore very promising for the management of type-2 diabetes. Other reported bioactivities of alaternin include potent antioxidant ability against peroxynitrite with IC 50 value of 2.70 lM (Park et al. 2004) , and hepatoprotective effects on tacrine-mediated cytotoxicity with EC 50 value of 4.02 lM (Jung et al. 2004 ). Alaternin (10 mg/kg) also showed neuroprotective effect in vivo in mice by inhibiting nitrotyrosine and lipid peroxidation, suppressing the expression of iNOS and decreasing microglial activation (an indicator of inflammation) (Shin et al. 2010 ).",

Anthraquinones are usually found in plants as glycosides and the absorption of these molecules in the intestine involves the hydrolysis of anthraquinone glycosides to their respective aglycone forms. The absorbed molecules are further subjected to hepatic glucuronidation and eliminated through urine or bile (Mohammed et al. 2020) . Although alaternin has been shown to have several pharmacological properties, there have been no studies that describe the pharmacokinetic properties of this compound. However, the bioavailability and absorption of other analogues (e.g. emodin, chrysophanol and physcion) were extensively studied (Shia et al. 2009; Wu et al. 2014a) . These studies have shown the low bioavailability of the aforementioned molecules. For example, emodin have shown low bioavailability when administered orally in rats which can be attributed to its extensive in vivo glucuronidation (Shia et al. 2010) . Consequently, the oral administration of these compounds is not optimal because of poor intestinal absorption and low bioavailability in vivo. Oral administration of anti-diabetic drugs presents several advantages including ease of production, stability of the formulation, ease of administration and patient compliance. New approaches need to be investigated to enhance the absorption and bioavailability of anthraquinones as anti-diabetic drugs.",

Plant-derived compounds represent a natural source of bioactive compounds that can be used for the development of effective drugs against diabetes mellitus. This review identified 8 chemically diverse plant molecules exhibiting potent alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity compared to the positive controls (Taxumariene F, Akebonoic acid, Morusin, Rhaponticin, Procyanidin A2, Alaternin, Mulberrofuran K and Psoralidin) and can be considered as promising drug candidates for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.",

In addition to alphaglucosidase inhibition, interestingly four of the selected compounds (rhaponticin, procyanidins, alaternin and mulberrofuran K) showed broader anti-diabetic activities that contributed to improved insulin signaling. Such molecules can be very promising in the development of a single drug resulting in shortened therapy and increased efficiency in controlling glycemia. However, more pre-clinical and clinical studies on these molecules are needed to determine their mechanisms of inhibition, pharmacokinetics and toxicology. Very few studies if any investigated the bioactivity of these molecules in vivo as well as the long-term toxicological assessment of these compounds. In addition, the pharmacokinetic properties of the promising compounds need to be investigated in the frame of their application as alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. For example, the carbohydrate composition of a meal can have a strong effect on gastric secretions and hepatic blood flow which diretly affects flavonoid absorption (Schramm et al. 2003) . The stability of the selected compounds under gastro-intestinal conditions is therefore a key factor to be investigated. Plantderived molecules are also known to interfere with the absorption and metabolism of other pharmaceutical agents (Sprouse and van Breemen 2016) . It is therefore important to investigate this aspect especially if the described molecules will be used as supplements for the enhancement of existing therapies.",

As revealed in this review, the nature of this interaction broadens the range of molecules that can potentially inhibit alphaglucosidase.
