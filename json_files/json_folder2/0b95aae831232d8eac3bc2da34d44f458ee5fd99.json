We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. Eleven studies with a total of 172,569 patients were included in the metaanalysis. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio of the age-adjusted qSOFA for predicting mortality and disease severity were 0.69 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53-0.81), 0.71 (95% CI 0.36-0.91), and 6.57 (95% CI 4.46-9.67), respectively. The area under the summary receiveroperating characteristic curve was 0.733. The pooled sensitivity and specificity for predicting mortality were 0.73 (95% CI 0.66-0.79) and 0.63 (95% CI 0.21-0.92), respectively. The pooled sensitivity and specificity for predicting disease severity were 0.73 (95% CI 0.21-0.97) and 0.72 (95% CI 0.11-0.98), respectively. The performance of the age-adjusted qSOFA for predicting mortality and disease severity was better in emergency department patients than in intensive care unit patients. The age-adjusted qSOFA has moderate predictive power and can help in rapidly identifying at-risk children, but its utility may be limited by its insufficient sensitivity.",

If enrolled patients received a diagnostic code (e.g., International Classification of Diseases code) indicative of an infection or were diagnosed with sepsis/septic shock via consensus definition, we accepted them as patients with confirmed infection. In addition, if enrolled patients had signs or symptoms of infection (e.g., fever), or were treated for a bacterial infection (e.g., treated with therapeutic antibiotics), we inferred suspected infection. Studies were included if they reported sufficient data to construct a 2 \u00d7 2 contingency tables.

Currently, there is no widely used assessment tool for assessing the quality of studies of predictive risk scores. This study used a revised seven-item quality assessment scale 27, 28 , which was derived from the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool 29 and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale 30 . It comprises seven criteria: unbiased patient selection; representative of a wide spectrum of disease severity; predictor variables assessed blinded to outcome; outcome assessed blinded to the predictor variables; accurate definition of outcomes; availability of the same clinical data; and adequate follow-up 27, 28 . We defined adequate follow-up as a follow-up of > 90%. Two reviewers (SE and SHY) independently performed the methodological quality assessment. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion.",

            "text": "Statistical analyses. Summary estimates of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-), and pooled diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were calculated using a bivariate random-effects model 31 . The DOR of a test (or score) is the ratio of the odds of positivity among patients versus the odds among healthy individuals or a control group 32, 33 . When the DOR increases to greater than 1, the discriminative power of the outcome becomes greater 32 . We used summary receiver-operating characteristic (SROC) curves to calculate the area under the curve (AUC), which assisted in estimating the discriminative power of a test or score 33 . The AUC takes values between 0 and 1, with higher values indicating better test (or score) performance 34 . Heterogeneity of sensitivity and specificity were evaluated from the forest plots of the studies' estimates and using a \u03c7 2 test (P < 0.1, significant). In the presence of significant heterogeneity, we conducted meta-regression analysis and a priori planned subgroup analysis to explore the sources of heterogeneity using the following as covariates with 95% confidence interval (CI): patient source (ED vs. ICU); sample size (< 10,000 vs. \u2265 10,000); outcome (mortality vs. disease severity); scales for assessing mental status in age-adjusted qSOFA (GCS vs. Alert, Voice, Pain, Unresponsive [AVPU] scale); age-specific vital signs criteria (2005 IPSCC definition vs. others); center (single center vs. multicenter); and cut-off value (\u2265 2 vs. \u2265 1). We excluded studies in the meta-regression analysis if they used both the GCS and AVPU scale for mental status checks, or if their primary outcome was both in-hospital mortality and disease severity concomitantly. In addition, we also performed pooled analysis using www.nature.com/scientificreports/ one study population per study to examine whether the results were biased by including the same populations multiple times. As the reason for separation into different datasets from a study varies (e.g., outcomes, cutoff, age-specific vital signs criteria), we selected the data using the cutoff value of \u2265 2 and 2005 IPSCC definition as age-specific vital sign criteria. We measured publication bias with visualization of funnel plots and Egger's test. Statistical analyses and meta-analyses were conducted using R program, version 3.6.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria); P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.",

The qSOFA was initially recommended by the SEPSIS-3 task force as a readily available bedside tool 16, 36 , and the age-adjusted qSOFA has the same advantages: it does not require laboratory tests and enables prompt and repeatable assessment of patients. However, as a screening tool to identify 'at-risk patients' , the age-adjusted qSOFA satisfies the requirements for convenience and feasibility, but does not satisfy the requirement for high sensitivity 37 .

Thus, we intended to assess the predictive performance of age-adjusted qSOFA as a quick, easy, bedside screening tool for identifying these 'at risk patients' .

DOR of 6.57 in our result means that the odds of positivity (above cutoff value of age-adjusted qSOFA) in at risk patients is about six times higher than the odds of positivity in nonrisk patients. DOR does not depend on disease prevalence 33 . However, it depends on what criteria are used to define disease or pathological conditions of the study population (e.g., comorbidity, disease severity) 33 .

In this review, we could not compare the pooled predictive performance of the age-adjusted qSOFA with that of the SIRS criteria, because there were few pediatric studies that provided the required data. Schlapbach et al. 13 compared the predictive performance of the age-adjusted qSOFA with that of SIRS criteria for in-hospital mortality and showed that the age-adjusted qSOFA had a lower sensitivity but higher specificity and LR+ than those of SIRS criteria. Higher specificity and LR+ indicate that the age-adjusted qSOFA is a better scale for ruling in pediatric patients at risk of mortality. Regarding disease severity, van Nassau et al. 23 reported that age-adjusted qSOFA \u2265 2 criteria showed lower sensitivity and LR+ but higher specificity than those of SIRS \u2265 2 criteria in predicting prolonged hospitalization (length of stay \u2265 7 days).",

We investigated the factors affecting heterogeneity by meta-regression and subgroup analysis, although we could not investigate factors related to differing diagnostic criteria and specific clinical settings. Second, if the predictive ability of the age-adjusted qSOFA was assessed with different outcomes or with different criteria in a same cohort, we consider them as separate studies 54 . Because the pooled results of AUC and DOR were similar between results using one study population per study and results using several datasets from the same study population, the overall predictive power of the age-adjusted qSOFA for mortality and morbidity can be considered similar in both analyses. This also indicates that the results would not to be strongly biased by including the same populations multiple times. Nevertheless, our results still need to be interpreted and applied cautiously because the same study population were pooled. Third, most of the included studies are retrospective studies, which were not devised to the validate the age-adjusted qSOFA. Fourth, most of the studies were conducted in western countries. Further studies are required to ensure the applicability of the results of studies of the age-adjusted qSOFA to other countries. Fifth, we did not search gray literature, as we aimed to review the characteristics of published literature. Incorporating a gray literature search may help to minimize the effects of publication bias 55 ; however, we found no significant publication bias in this analysis. Sixth, long-term outcomes or healthcare costs were not available in the literature that was included; thus we could not evaluate these in this analysis. Finally, we could not compare the overall predictive performance of the age-adjusted qSOFA with other predictive biomarkers, due to the limited number of clinical studies.",
