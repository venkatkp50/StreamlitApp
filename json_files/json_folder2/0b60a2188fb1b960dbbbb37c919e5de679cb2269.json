TropNO 2 VCDs from OMI and TROPOMI reveal sharp reductions of 33%-72% during 2020 LNY holiday season and the co-occurring outbreak of COVID-19 relative to the climatological mean of 2005-2019 LNY holiday seasons, and 22%-67% relative to the 2019 LNY holiday season. These reductions of TropNO 2 VCD occur majorly over highly polluted metropolitan areas with condensed industrial and transportation emission sources. COVID-19 control measures including lockdowns and shelter-in-place regulations are the primary reason for these tropospheric NO 2 reductions over most areas of East China in 2020 LNY holiday season relative to the 2019 LNY holiday season, as COVID-19 control measures may explain ~87%-90% of tropospheric NO 2 reduction in Wuhan as well as ~62%-89% in Beijing, Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and Pearl River Delta (PRD) areas. The clean air regulation of China also contributes significantly to reductions of tropospheric NO 2 simultaneously and is the primary factor in the Sichuan Basin area, by explaining ~56%-62% of the tropospheric NO 2 reduction there. Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2020; Earth Observatory NASA, 2020; Lian et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020). Meanwhile, the outbreak of COVID-19 happened during the 2020 lunar new year (LNY) holiday season (a.k.a. spring festival) as the 2020 LNY's day was January 25, 2020 based on the lunar calendar. The LNY holiday season in China usually lasts for approximately 40 days and is herein defined as 14 days before the LNY's day and 25 days after (Figure 1). During the LNY holiday season, the tropospheric NO 2 abundance indicates \"holiday effects\" over China that are characterized by two high peaks before/after the national LNY holiday and a trough in the middle. This pattern shifts with the LNY's day on the Julian calendar (Tan et al., 2009; Zhang et Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 4 al., 2019; more in section 2.1). The COVID-19 lockdown in China started on January 23, 2020 and lasted through the entire 2020 LNY holiday season. As a result, studies on tropospheric NO 2 variation during the outbreak of COVID-19 shall take account of the impacts of LNY holiday seasons and shifts of LNY days on the Julian calendar every year (Liu et al., 2020). Also, China has begun to conduct new emission regulations since 2010, after which tropospheric NO 2 has been decreasing rapidly nation-wide (de Foy et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2016). These clean air regulations may also contribute to the observed tropospheric NO 2 reduction during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China. Significant reduction in tropospheric NO 2 vertical column densities (TropNO 2 VCDs) was observed by satellite instruments during the COVID-19 lockdown period (Bauwens et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020), which may be caused by a combination of \"holiday effects\" of LNY, meteorological conditions, control measures and lockdowns due to the COVID-19 outbreak, and the continuation of clean air regulations for clean air in China. The LNY \"holiday effects\" of TropNO 2 VCDs can be canceled out in this study since this study only focuses TropNO 2 VCDs over LNY holiday seasons. The meteorological influences on tropospheric NO 2 should be small in this study because meteorological conditions were normal in 2020 LNY holiday seasons compared to the 2005-2019 climatology, and 40-day average TropNO 2 VCDs smooth out most weather induced variability(European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2020; more discussions in Section 4.2). As such, the goal of this study is to understand the variation of TropNO 2 VCDs in East China during the 2005-2020 LNY holiday seasons and quantify contributions by both COVID-19 control measures and clean air regulations to the reduction of TropNO 2 VCDs during 2020 LNY holiday season in East China. We combine tropospheric NO 2 observations from Ozone Journal Pre-proof temperature, no lighting and inactive biosphere (Lin, 2012). The dominant contributor to NO2 variation is anthropogenic emission that shifts with the lunar calendar. As a result, studies on tropospheric NO 2 variation during the outbreak of COVID-19 shall take account of the impacts of LNY holiday seasons and shifts of LNY days on the Julian calendar every year.

In the following week, the government of China had announced mandatory \"shelter-in-place\" orders. These COVID-19 control measures and consequently minimized human activities in China and worldwide are expected to result in substantially reduced NO x (NO x = NO+NO 2 ) emissions due to the dominancy of anthropogenic NO x sources (Bauwens et al., 2020; Collivignarelli et al., J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f TROPspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) with fine resolutions but only available in 2019-2020 LNY holiday seasons.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 557, "end": 575, "text": "Tian et al., 2020)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 858, "end": 877, "text": "(Tian et al., 2020)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1209, "end": 1231, "text": "(Bauwens et al., 2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1232, "end": 1255, "text": "Collivignarelli et al.,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The LNY day is set according to the lunar calendar and varies from late January to early February on Julian calendars.

Millions of people in mainland China return to their hometowns from working places in the beginning of the holiday season and travel back to work sites towards the end of the holiday season (Li et al., 2016) . The LNY holiday season with a large migration usually lasts approximately 40 days, 14 days before the LNY's day and 25 days after, as shown in Figure 1 . The industrial and transportation-related emissions decrease before the LNY's day, stay at a relatively low level during the LNY holiday, and then gradually increase back to normal after the holiday.

The panel (a) reveals large hotspots of TropNO 2 VCDs over the North China plain and other metropolitan areas as labeled in the plot. High TropNO 2 VCDs are seen over China. The mean TropNO 2 VCDs are up to 0.47 DU and 0.68 DU in Pearl River Delta (PRD) and Yangtze River Delta (YRD) areas, respectively. The Beijing, Sichuan Basin and Wuhan areas show slightly lower TropNO 2 VCDs as 0.25 DU, 0.16 DU and 0.37 DU, respectively. Both OMI and TROPOMI with correction applied observed 0.1-0.4 DU reductions over East China in 2020 LNY holiday season relative to means of 2005-2019 LNY holiday seasons, as shown in panels (b) and (c) of Figure 3, respectively. TropNO 2 VCDs have decreased by 55%-72% over PRD, YRD and Wuhan metropolitans in 2020 LNY holiday season relative to mean TropNO 2 VCDs of 2005-2019 LNY holiday seasons, while a less significant decrease of 33%-58% is observed in Beijing and Sichuan Basin. Both OMI and TROPOMI observations show that tropospheric NO 2 reductions occur mainly in the North China Plain and other metropolitan areas that are highly polluted with concentrated industrial and transportation sectors. Ground NO 2 concentrations has also been reported to decrease sharply during COVID-19 lockdowns globally(Collivignarelli et al., 2020; Lian et al., 2020;Tob\u00edas et al., 2020). This of tropospheric NO 2 trends during LNY holiday seasons TropNO 2 VCDs had been increasing dramatically in China during the first decade of 21 st century due to the rapid development of economy and industry(Richter et al., 2005;Zhang et al., 2018).Since 2010, the Chinese government has strengthened pollution control measures to reduce national emissions of nitrogen oxides by 10% by 2015 compared with 2010 NO x emissions (de Foy et al., 2016; Hou et al., 2019; Vicedo-Cabrera et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2018). TropNO 2 VCDs in China started to decrease after reaching maximums around 2011-2012, depending on regions (Hou et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2019). These decreasing trends of TropNO 2 VCDs in China were mainly caused by the clean air regulations, while the contribution of meteorological factors was negligible (<1%) (Lin et al., 2019). As result, the time series of TropNO 2 VCDs over China indicate a \"concave\" shape with a peak around 2011-2012. Time scales of weather patterns are approximately 1-2 weeks or less (Seinfeld and Pandis, 2016). The stochastic patterns imposed by weather systems will be averaged out in this study since we are averaging TropNO 2 VCDs consistently over 40 days of LNY holiday seasons (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2020). Furthermore, to investigate the effect of meteorology on the reduction of TropNO 2 VCDs, meteorological and climatological data of 2005-2020 LNY holidays have been used. These data include temperatures at 2m above ground level (T2m) and 10m (T10m), wind speed at 10m above ground level (WS10m) from ERA5 (Hersbach et al., 2018) and MERRA-2 (Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2) (Gelaro et al., 2017), wind speed at 100m above ground level WS100m) from ERA5 and wind speed at 50m above ground level (WS50m) from MERRA-2. Meteorological conditions were normal during 2020 LNY holiday season, compared to climatological data of 2005-2019 LNY holiday seasons, as shown in Figures S4-S9. For example, the median T2m is approximately 285K over Wuhan in 2020 LNY holiday seasons as in Figure S4, which is close to the median T2m of LNY holiday seasons in any year in 2005-2019. Consequently, meteorological and climatological conditions are assumed to have no significant influences on the reduction of tropospheric NO 2 over East China during 2020 LNY holiday season. To capture the aforementioned \"concave\"-shape interannual variability , a quadratic regression model ( ) is utilized to fit the TropNO 2 VCDs time series of 2005-2019 LNY holiday seasons, where x and y represent the year and TropNO 2 VCDs during LNY holiday season of that year. The expected TropNO 2 VCDs during the 2020 LNY holiday season, without COVID-19 influence, can be predicted by linearly extrapolating the 2019 values with a slope of , where . The predicted 2019-2020 changes of TropNO 2 VCDs, calculated as the difference between 2019 values and the predicted 2020 values, are plotted at the level 3 grid using OMI data in the panel (a) of Figure 4. This change map indicates that TropNO 2 VCDs have negative trends over East China, especially in the highly polluted North China Plain and other metropolitan areas, due to the clean air regulations of China. The real reductions of tropospheric NO 2 in 2019 and 2020 LNY holiday seasons, as observed by OMI and TROPOIMI, are ~1-9 times greater than the corresponding predicted changes (Figure 4 (b)-(c)). Tropospheric VCDs declines by 22%-67% in the 2020 LNY holiday season relative to the 2019 LNY holiday season. These negative changes indicate that COVID-19 control measures and clean air regulations both contribute to reductions 2020 LNY holiday season over East China.
