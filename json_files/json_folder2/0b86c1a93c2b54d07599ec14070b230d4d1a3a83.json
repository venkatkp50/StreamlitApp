ACE2 is highly expressed in the lung's type II alveolar cells, cardiac myocytes, cholangiocytes and in lower amounts in hepatocytes in the liver, as well as the proximal tubule cells of the kidney, bladder urothelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine, among others, while being weakly expressed on the surface of epithelial cells in the oral and nasal mucosa and nasopharynx [2] [3] [4] . In most cases, the immune response is self-competent, leading to recovery. However, in some patients, the immune response is unbalanced and non-competent, with age, gender and comorbidities such as arterial hypertension or diabetes being acknowledged risk factors. As a consequence, these patients require hospitalization, with various levels of clinical manifestations that need to be managed appropriately. Respiratory distress in the form of bilateral pneumonia was highlighted as the main adverse clinical manifestation [5] . However, as the pandemic advances, we have learned the systemic nature of the disease, which affects multiple organs and is accompanied by thrombotic events (which may occur in infected patients even post-recovery) [6] [7] [8] .",

However, there is controversy regarding their use [26, 27] . As an example, ibuprofen has received bad publicity, as it was hypothesized that its administration would result in overexpression of ACE2, which would in turn increase the risk of cell entry by the virus. Even today, despite a number of manuscripts disproving this hypothesis, paracetamol is prioritized as an antipyretic over ibuprofen [28] [29] [30] [31] . Regarding the use of corticosteroids, a recent study showed that low-dose dexamethasone, especially in severely ill COVID-19 patients (i.e., intensive care unit (ICU)-hospitalized patients with respiratory distress), greatly improved their survival [32] . However, the publicity around this publication and the lost information in press releases has contributed to the generalized use of corticosteroids in many hospitals, which may not always be beneficial to a patient not requiring this intervention, as they may disturb or further unbalance an already noncompetent immune response [33] [34] [35] .",

Anticoagulants (low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) being among them) were initially administered only to those patients presenting thrombotic events or those either immobilized or ICU-hospitalized. Gradually, with the generated knowledge and pandemic progression, several hospitals implemented thromboprophylaxis to all COVID-19 patients immediately upon admission and even after hospital discharge, to prevent complications and thrombotic events that have been reported as a common sequel to the infection. In fact, the term immunothrombosis has been established to refer to the thrombosis of septic shock and acute immune responses due to infections of different etiology [17] . To date, the effectiveness of therapeutic LMWH has been emphatically studied in ICU-hospitalized patients, and information on non-ICU hospitalized or prophylactic approaches in COVID-19 patients is lacking.",

Our aim is to critically review the current assumptions regarding patient treatment and to establish priorities for the management of COVID-19 patients, considering, above all, that with no specific treatment available, a risk-benefit rationale must be applied to each patient.

The survival probability (SP) at 1 week was 88.1%, and it was 75.1% at 2 week, reaching 50% at 26 days (Figure 1a ). The median in-hospital length of stay was 7 days, which was maintained in discharged patients and was 6 days for those who died (Figure 1b and Figure S1a ). The distribution of drug administration corresponding to the main treatment arms of study (i.e., arterial hypertension (AHT) (ACE2-Is and ARBs, i.e., anti-AHT drugs), inflammation (corticosteroids) and hemostasis (LMWH)) in discharged patients and patients who died (exitus) is represented in Figure 1c and summarized in Table S1 . Cox proportional-hazards regression identified age (older), sex (males) and AHT (but not diabetes) as risk variables (Figure 1d ). Among the treatment arms of study, all treatment regimens, including low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) alone or in combination with corticosteroids and anti-AHT drugs, conferred a significant advantage, as opposed to corticosteroids and anti-AHT drugs alone or in combination, having the group of patients not treated with these treatment arms as the control group ( Figure 1d ). Given the previous tendency to focus treatment response studies on ICU-hospitalized patients, we decided to stratify the cohort based on the ICU and non-ICU hospitalization of COVID-19 patients. The survival probability (SP) reached 50% at 23 days in ICUhospitalized patients and 25 days in those hospitalized in general wards ( Figure S2a ). The median stay length of the non-ICU hospitalized patients was 7 days (discharge 7 days and exitus 5 days), while those requiring ICU hospitalization stayed in a hospital a median of 12 days (discharge 14 days and exitus 11.5 days) ( Figure S1b ). While the stay length was sensitively increased in the ICU-hospitalized patients, the SP was only notably different between 10-25 days of hospitalization. The distribution of treatment arms in the stratified cohort based on ICU and non-ICU hospitalization is represented in Figure S2b . Cox regression analysis on the non-ICU hospitalized patient group suggested a significant advantage for LMWH-treated patients ( Figure S2c) , with age and sex as maintained risk variables, while comorbidities (AHT and diabetes) did not reach significance.

The median stay length of the patients treated with anti-AHT drugs was 8 days (7 days non-ICU hospitalized and 16 days ICU hospitalized) (Figure 1b and Figure S1 ). After PSM analysis with sex, age, comorbidities (AHT and diabetes) and the remaining treatment arms (corticosteroids and LMWH) and their combinations as covariates, we did not observe a reduced SP in COVID-19 patients when treated with anti-AHT drugs, compared with patients that did not receive such a treatment regime (Figure 2a ). Rather we observed the contrary. The SP of the matched populations reached 50% at 24 days for patients treated with anti-AHT drugs, while in non-treated patients, a 50% SP was reached at 19 days. Cox regression analysis of the matched populations confirmed that, if anything, the administration of anti-AHT drugs was not detrimental, as has been asserted by others, and might even be beneficial (Figure 2a ) [16, [19] [20] [21] [39] [40] [41] . The individual analysis of patients receiving either ACE2-Is, ARBs or a combination of both ( Figure 2b ) suggested a subtle advantage of ACE2-Is over ARBs and supported the main observation (i.e., the administration of these anti-AHT drugs is not detrimental). Of note, there were a number of patients receiving both anti-AHT drugs in combination which followed the same trend, especially considering the first two weeks of hospitalization. However, due to the low number of patients, the Cox regression analysis did not reach significance. ",

We assessed the impact of corticosteroid administration to COVID-19 patients in the cohort of the study, filtering out those patients treated with NSAIDs or other immunosuppressing drugs (see Table S2 ). The patients treated with corticosteroids stayed in the hospital a median of 8 days (6 days non-ICU hospitalized and 10 days ICU hospitalized) (Figure 1 and Figure S1 ). We performed PSM analysis, having sex, age, comorbidities (AHT and diabetes) and the remaining treatment arms (anti-AHT drugs and LMWH) and their combinations as covariates. The SP of the matched populations reached 50% at 25 days in the group treated with corticosteroids, while it reached 50% SP at 19 days in the non-treated group. However, Cox regression analysis of the matched populations showed that the administration of corticosteroids did not represent a significant advantage (Figure 3a ). Most strikingly, when performing this analysis and considering only patients that had received dexamethasone, the SP of the matched groups reached 50% at 23 days, displaying a window of advantage for the non-treated groups between 2 and 23 days (Figure 3b ). The median stay length of this treatment group was 8 days ( Figure S1a ). Cox regression analysis of the matched populations did not show a significant advantage for dexamethasone treatment compared with the non-treated group. In fact, when we looked at the global cohort, before applying PSM, the results were quite concerning, as treatment with dexamethasone showed a significant hazard to COVID-19 patients ( Figure S3 ). While this effect was lost after PSM analysis (Figure 3b ), these results opened the debate on whether immunosuppression should be considered cautiously and limited to the situations that require it (i.e., to facilitate pulmonary capacity as part of the general guidelines in patients with respiratory distress), but not as a protocolized guideline to treat hospitalized COVID-19 patients in general, as this seems to happen. The distribution of treatment arms in the stratified cohort based on ICU and non-ICU hospitalization is represented in Figure S2b , where it can be seen that the percentage of non-ICU hospitalized patients receiving corticosteroids was around 40% in discharged patients and 60% in patients who died.",

            "text": "An important question remains unanswered as to whether the patients receiving corticosteroids were those presenting severe pulmonary affections, thus compromising the previous analysis. In order to overcome this issue, we decided to categorize the patients based on registered diagnosis or not of severe respiratory distress. Patients with respiratory insufficiency, respiratory distress, pulmonary interstitial disease, chronic pulmonary obstruction, asthma, atelectasis, emphysema and pleural edema, which fall under classifications J43, J44, J45, J80, J84, J90, J96 and J98 in the eCIE10ES, were identified, and we performed the same analysis in comparison with patients without registration of those clinical manifestations. Validating this categorization, the Cox regression analysis demon-strated that severe respiratory distress was a significant risk factor ( Figure S3b ). As shown in Table 1 , 793 patients had severe respiratory distress (50% were treated with corticosteroids), and 1242 patients did not present severe respiratory distress (of which 44% were treated with corticosteroids). Remarkably, the exitus rate doubled in both categories when comparing the corticosteroid treatment arm with the rest of the patients. Interestingly, the SP of the matched populations reached 50% earlier in the group treated with corticosteroids than in the non-treated group, regardless of the presentation or lack of presentation of severe respiratory distress (Figure 3c ). As observed in the global analysis (Figure 3a) , Cox regression analysis of the matched populations showed that the administration of corticosteroids did not represent a significant advantage in either category (Figure 3c) . The same trend was observed when studying dexamethasone alone, although the patient numbers were very low, and the SPs could not be calculated (Figure 3d) . We should consider that corticosteroids in particular may unbalance the immune response in unexpected ways, which might compromise the fight against the virus [33, 34, 45, 46] . Paradoxically, the use of steroids can potentially cause an unbalanced immune response (e.g., lower cytokine release, but enhanced cytokine-receptor expression plus neutrophil mobilization increase, among others), which may not favor good evolution in these patients [47, 48] .",

We filtered out patients receiving oral anticoagulants and anti-platelet drugs, as their representation was low for performing statistical analyses, and because oral anticoagulants are generally replaced by LMWH in COVID-19 hospitalized patients due to incompatibilities with other treatments or compromised tolerability due to respiratory affections or intubation. The median stay length of patients treated with LMWH was 7 days (7 days non-ICU hospitalized and 12 days ICU hospitalized) (Figure 1 and Figure S1 ). After PSM analysis with sex, age, comorbidities (AHT and diabetes) and the remaining treatment arms (corticosteroids and anti-AHT drugs) and their combinations as covariates, we did observe an improved SP for COVID-19 patients when treated with LMWH compared with patients that did not receive such a treatment regime (Figure 4a ). The SP of the matched groups reached 50% at 24 days in LMWH-treated patients, while it reached 50% at 19 days in the patient group not treated with LMWH. Cox regression analysis of the matched groups showed a significant advantage for the group treated with LMWH ( Figure 4a ). We have to consider that, at first, LMWH was administered only therapeutically when severe thrombotic events manifested. As the pandemic advanced, the tendency to implement the prophylactic administration of LMWH became more popular, although this measure has not been protocolized globally [49] . The median stay length of patients treated with prophylactic doses of LMWH was 7 days, while those treated with therapeutic doses of LMWH stayed in a hospital a median of 9 days ( Figure S1a ).",

In particular, treatment with dexamethasone may potentially be detrimental to those patients in general wards (not critically ill and without respiratory distress). From our point of view, corticosteroids might elicit an undesired effect on the overall immune response, and more targeted alternatives should be considered such as the containment of tissue infiltration by neutrophils with sivelestat, a neutrophil elastase inhibitor which has been proven effective to inhibit their transmigration capacity [56, 57] .

These results have been independently obtained from the same cohort (HM Hospitales) as previously reported [59] and are supported by a recent pool analysis [60] . Furthermore, the implementation of the use of LMWH upon admission in a prophylactic manner did not associate with increased bleeding, which was also supported by the same study [60] . Current ongoing or planned randomized studies will address the effect of prophylactic or therapeutic LMWH doses in COVID-19 patients (e.g., the IMPACT trial, NCT04406389 (only critically ill patients); the COVID-HEP trial, NCT04345848; the COALIZAO ACTION trial, NCT04394377; the CORIMMUNO-COAG trial, NCT04344756; and the FREEDOM COVID trial, NCT04512079) with increasing demand from the scientific and clinical communities [61] [62] [63] . Interestingly, it has been reported that heparin inhibits the cellular invasion by SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the spike protein of the virus, as shown in vitro, using the equivalent to prophylactic doses [64] . A later study showed that unfractionated heparin had stronger antiviral activity in vitro compared with LMWHs [65] .
