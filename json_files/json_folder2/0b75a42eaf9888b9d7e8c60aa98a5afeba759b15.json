PCR tests are conducted by healthcare workers who take a swab from the back of the nose and throat. The swab is then sent to a pathology laboratory for testing and individuals receive their results via a mobile phone text message in approximately 24 hours, although it can take days to receive the result. It is estimated that the PCR testing system has cost the Australian government $3.7 billion to deliver to date. 4 The presentation of the highly transmissible Omicron variant in Australia, coinciding with a relaxation of public health restrictions and the social \"festive season\" of Christmas and New Years Eve has led to a surge in the numbers of COVID-19 cases in Australia, swamping the PCR testing system.

There are concerns that some people are unable to afford RATs, particularly when multiple tests are needed, and some public health experts and social service organisations are calling for them to be made free to encourage greater uptake.

            "text": "Early isolation is an accepted strategy for containing the spread of COVID-19. In countries like Singapore and Germany, population testing and efficient vaccination roll-outs have become the key strategies of containing COVID-19 from this point forward. In addition, Mina et al (2021) argue that RAT based testing is a preferable public health measure for \"test to release\" because their technology allow the detection of cases that are currently infectious, as opposed to PCR based testing which results in 50-70% of positives being post-infectious, leading to unnecessarily longer quarantine times. 10 A key concern with a user-pays model of rapid antigen self-testing is the inequities it potentially accentuates. Globally, COVID-19 is impacting negatively on vulnerable population groups, 11 and use of expensive user-pays RATs for population testing is likely to widen the disparities. There are reports emerging in Australia of charitable organisations forced to purchase RAT kits on behalf of socioeconomically disadvantaged consumers. Thus, policy decisions regarding the distribution of RATs in Australia should also be considered through an equity lens. This paper has presented a simple cost-effectiveness analysis of government-funded RATs in Australia. The decision tree only estimated effects in terms of additional early isolated COVID-19 cases and key model input parameters are unobservable, in particular, the prevalence of COVID-19 in the cohort who would use government-funded RATs. However, our interpretation of the presented scenario analyses indicates that an implementation strategy that targets a user group with at least 5% COVID-19 prevalence would be a cost-effective government policy. Implementation is an important consideration given potential issues with the supply and distribution of RATs, but limited supply should mean that an effective implementation policy would target a user group with a non-trivial prevalence rate.",
