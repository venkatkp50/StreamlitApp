            "text": "Retrograde amnesia refers to failure to remember events that occurred prior to an incident in contrast to the normal or minimally impaired ability to encode and retrieve events occurring after it [1, 2] . Retrograde amnesia can be triggered not only by neurological incidents such as traumatic brain injury [3] , hypoxia [4] , and herpes encephalitis [5] , but also by psychological incidents such as extremely stressful experiences (e.g., personal threat, war and military-related activities, natural disasters) or dissociative fugue [2, 6, 7] . However, the distinction between neurological and psychogenic causes of retrograde amnesia is not always easy, as these causes may be combined [8] . Critically, retrograde amnesia can be associated not only with difficulties in retrieving events encoded before the onset of amnesia, but also with difficulties in future thinking (i.e., in the ability to travel forward in time to imagine or simulate events that may occur in the future) [9] . Considering future thinking in retrograde amnesia, the aim of this paper was twofold. First, we assessed the ability of L, an individual with retrograde amnesia, to construct future events. Second, we assessed whether his future thinking was related with his pupil size. We discuss research assessing pupil size during past and future thinking in normal persons as well as studies assessing pupil size during past thinking in patients with retrograde amnesia.",

Its diameter typically varies from 2 to 4 mm in bright light to 4 to 8 mm in the dark [10] . Two sets of smooth muscles in the iris control the pupil size, namely, the sphincter and the dilator muscles. Whereas the sphincter muscles decrease the diameter of the pupil, the dilator muscles increase it [11, 12] . The pupil reacts to three distinct kinds of stimuli: (1) it dilates in response to darkness, (2) it dilates in response to distant fixation, and (3) it dilates in response to increased cognitive effort [13] .",

To this end, El Haj, Janssen, Gallouj, and Lenoble [18] invited healthy young adults to retrieve personal memories in a past thinking condition and to count aloud in a control condition. In both conditions, the participants faced a white wall so that any variation in pupil size was not attributable to external stimuli, and the pupil size was monitored with eye-tracking glasses. The results showed a larger pupil size during past thinking than during the control task. This increased pupil size was attributed by El Haj, Janssen, Gallouj, and Lenoble [18] to the search and retrieval processes involved in reconstructing memories during past thinking. The effect of cognitive processing on pupil size during past thinking was further demonstrated by Jansse, et al. [19] , who monitored pupil size during past thinking in healthy young adults. Pupil size was measured while the participants retrieved personal memories with the help of cue words (i.e., effortless past thinking) or without the help of cue words (i.e., effortful past thinking). The analysis demonstrated less retrieval time and less pupil dilation during effortless than during effortful past thinking. These findings demonstrate how pupil size can be modulated by the cognitive load of past thinking.",

Recently, we assessed pupil size during past thinking in a person with retrograde amnesia [21] . L is a 19-year-old right-handed man without any history of neurological or psychiatric disorders who developed retrograde amnesia following a dissociative fugue. We invited him to retrieve retrograde memories and anterograde memories while his pupil size was monitored with eye-tracking glasses. The results demonstrated impaired retrograde retrieval but successful anterograde retrieval as well as decreased pupil size during retrograde retrieval. This decreased pupil size was attributed to a decline in the cognitive processes involved in retrograde retrieval, i.e., a decline in the processes involved in searching, accessing, and developing memories during retrograde retrieval. While that study was the first to assess pupil size during past thinking in retrograde amnesia, there is still, to our knowledge, no published research on pupil size during future thinking in retrograde amnesia. This is an important issue because retrograde amnesia may involve diminished future thinking. This was demonstrated in retrograde amnesia patients by De Luca, Benuzzi, Bertossi, Braghittoni, di Pellegrino, and Ciaramelli [9] , who assessed past and future thinking in a person who developed retrograde amnesia following hypoxia due to cardiac arrest. The person demonstrated difficulties in retrieving retrograde memories during past thinking and difficulties in imagining personal future events during future thinking.",

After being questioned by the police at the station, L was taken by the health service to the neurology department of the Nantes Hospital. During the neurological exam, L was conscious and had no neurological/psychiatric symptoms. The medical exam showed normal heart condition and blood pressure. L was also examined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed with a 1.5-Tesla scanner with Diffusion Tensor Imaging, T1weighted without and with contrast agent, and 3D T2-SPACE fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences. As illustrated in Figure 1 , MRI showed no cerebral abnormality. Regarding the amnestic symptomatology, the fugue episode left L with a dense retrograde amnesia, observed during the initial and following medical/psychological testing. While L had insight into his amnesia, he was unable to remember specific personal events that occurred prior to the fugue episode.

This apparent contradiction may be explained by a major difference between our case and that of De Luca, Benuzzi, Bertossi, Braghittoni, di Pellegrino, and Ciaramelli [9] . Their case had a cerebral abnormality, i.e., a reduction of gray matter in the thalamus, cerebellum, and fusiform gyrus bilaterally, as well as in regions involved in future thinking, including the hippocampus. On the other hand, L had no cerebral abnormality. Thus, unlike in the case of neurological retrograde amnesia, future thinking may be preserved in the case of dissociative retrograde amnesia, even though some forms of nondeclarative memory can be preserved in cases with hippocampal lesions [25, 26] . We suggest that patients with dissociative retrograde amnesia might use their anterograde memories to construct plausible future scenarios. These future scenarios may also involve some retrograde information that is implicitly accessible. This hypothesis is supported by the assumption that dissociative retrograde amnesia can be mediated by suppression processes that serve to keep undesired or distressing memories out of self-awareness or autonoetic consciousness [7, 27] . We thus suggest that patients with dissociative retrograde amnesia may avoid distressing retrograde memories by constructing desirable future scenarios. While clinically plausible, our assumption should be considered with caution, because our study does not provide an empirical basis to support it.",

This larger pupil size might be due to the cognitive load of future thinking. Although both past and future thinking involve the retrieval of information from memory, future thinking requires more cognitive processes, involved in the flexible recombination of the retrieved information to form novel scenarios [28] [29] [30] . This assumption is supported by research demonstrating how future thinking is typically more effortful and involves more cognitive processing and reconstruction time than past thinking [31, 32] . Thus, the larger pupil size during future than during past thinking, as observed in L, might be due to the higher cognitive load of future thinking with respect to past thinking. This assumption is further supported by the wealth of research demonstrating how pupil size increases with cognitive effort [14] [15] [16] [17] . While cognitive effort can account for the larger pupil size during future than during past thinking in our study, other factors may be involved, such as emotion. It is well known that the pupil typically dilates in response to emotionally laden information compared to neutral information [16, 33, 34] . This dilation has been observed for a wide variety of stimuli such as emotional video-clips [35] and facial expressions [36, 37] . Thus, the larger pupil size during future than during past thinking in our study could be influenced by the emotional load of the constructed future events.",

The decreased pupil size during retrograde retrieval may be due to a decline in the cognitive mechanisms involved in the retrieval of retrograde events, such as the mechanisms involved in the search of information or in accessing it. The decreased pupil size during retrograde retrieval may also mirror a decline in mechanisms involved in the elaboration of memory, if retrieved. It may also mirror failures to use retrieved semantic information as cues to access episodic information. Together, the decreased pupil size during retrograde retrieval can be attributed to a decline in cognitive processing involved in retrograde memory. This assumption is supported by the diminished ability in L to retrieve specific retrograde events, compared with his preserved ability to retrieve specific anterograde events.",
