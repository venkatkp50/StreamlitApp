            "text": "We hypothesized that an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol for patients undergoing female pelvic reconstructive surgery would conserve hospital resources without compromising patient safety. Methods In June 2020, an ERAS protocol designed to promote same-day discharge was initiated that included pre-operative hydration, a urinary anesthetic, non-narcotic analgesia, perineal ice, a bowel regimen, enrollment of the family to assist with care, and communication regarding planned same-day discharge. We compared demographic, operative, hospital stay, complications, and cost data in patients undergoing pelvic organ prolapse or incontinence surgery over 4 sequential months pre (PRE; N = 82) and post (POST; N = 91) ERAS implementation using univariate statistics. Results There were no differences in demographics, operative details, or complications (p > 0.05). There were no significant differences in overall revenues or expenses (p > 0.05), but bed unit cost was significantly lower in the POST group ($210 vs $533, p < 0.0001). There was a trend toward an increased operating margin in POST patients ($4,554 vs $2,151, p = 0.1163). Significantly more POST surgeries were performed in an ambulatory setting (73.6% vs 48.8%, p = 0.0008) and resulted in same-day discharge (80.2% vs 50.0%, p = 0.0003). There were no differences in the rates of emergency room or unexpected clinic visits (p > 0.05). Prescribed post-operative opiate dose was significantly reduced in POST patients (p < 0.0001). Conclusions In patients undergoing female pelvic reconstructive surgery, an ERAS protocol facilitated transfer of procedures to an ambulatory surgical site and permitted same-day discharge without increasing complications, clinic visits, or emergency room visits. It also reduced bed unit cost and may improve operating margins.",

A surgeon reviewed the protocol in detail with the patient and selected family member(s) or friends at their preoperative clinic visit. Specifically, the importance of pre-surgery analgesia, post-operative pain control that minimized reliance on narcotics, early ambulation, and a bowel regimen were explained in detail to the patient and the selected caregiver. The rationale behind same-day discharge was also explained to patients in the context of the following factors: the COVID-19 pandemic with its resultant infection risk and national hospital personnel shortages, low complication rates following pelvic reconstructive surgery, very close follow-up by phone by a provider involved in their care, and post-operative anesthesia care unit (PACU) monitoring immediately following the procedure. They were assured that no patient would be \"forced\" to leave the hospital following surgery if they did not feel safe doing so and that any post-operative issues would be addressed prior to discharge. They were also provided with a handout at the preoperative visit describing the ERAS protocol.",

            "text": "Our study shows that an ERAS protocol focused on nonnarcotic analgesia, post-operative care assistance, hydration, and expedited return of bowel function can safely facilitate same-day discharge and conserve valuable hospital resources without compromising patient safety in patients undergoing female pelvic reconstructive surgery. Despite having a slightly higher Charlson Comorbidity Index, a measure that has been shown to directly correlate with poor surgical outcomes and complications, the POST patients were discharged more often on the day of surgery and without an increase in complications, ED visits, or unexpected clinic visits. This is of particular importance during the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, when studies. In a 2019 study, Trowbridge et al. implemented a multi-modal ERAS protocol for patients undergoing pelvic reconstructive surgeries that emphasized carbohydrate loading, minimizing narcotics, and early post-operative ambulation and found a 2-h reduction in length of stay without an increase in complications, costs, or ED visits [7] . In a similar study (i.e., in patients undergoing urogynecological surgeries), Carter-Brooks et al. found that ERAS protocol implementation resulted in more frequent same-day discharges, no changes in complications, and no changes in clinic or ED visits [8] . Yoong et al. applied an ERAS protocol to patients specifically undergoing vaginal hysterectomy, and similarly found a reduction in hospital time of over 50% without compromising outcomes or increasing costs [9] . Our specific ERAS interventions are supported by the literature, many of which are summarized in a report published by the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Society on vulvar and vaginal surgery [10] . None of these prior studies, however, evaluated the economic impact of ERAS protocols specifically for urogynecological procedures. Same-day hospital discharge can positively impact costs, as nursing resources for overnight admission are reduced. Our study found a trend toward an increased operating margin after ERAS protocol implementation. A component of the operating margin that was significantly improved was bed unit cost, which is incurred by a patient occupying a hospital bed in a nursing unit during the pre-operative and/ or post-operative stay. This is in line with the primary goal of our study, which was to conserve beds and nursing staff for patients critically ill during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given that surgical technique was not changed between PRE and POST ERAS patients, we believe that the overall reduction in cost is driven by the fact that patients spent less time within the hospital. This was all achieved without increasing post-procedural costs in the form of ED visits, unplanned clinic visits, readmissions, or other complications.",

Additionally, like most of the available literature on ERAS protocols, it is difficult to parse the contributions of individual elements in the protocol (hydration, pain control, etc.) given that all were implemented concurrently. We are also limited by a relatively small sample size, which explains the large apparent improvement in operating margins post ERAS implementation but lack of statistical significance. The low complication rate in the context of a relatively small sample size also limits our ability to make robust conclusions regarding differences in complications. Regarding the cost data, another limitation is that only revenues and expenses associated with the surgical visit encounter were collected; however, given the 0% rate of major (Clavien IV-V) complications and the similarity in rates of minor complications, ED visits, and unexpected clinic visits between the compared groups, we do not believe that these data would provide any meaningful insights. Another limitation is regarding narcotics data, where we analyzed the prescribed dose of narcotic rather than the actual amount used by patients. Finally, any complications or additional costs incurred outside of our healthcare system were not captured in our center's electronic medical record and therefore were not included in the present study.",
