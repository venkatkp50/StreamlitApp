The number of infected and deceased patients continues to increase globally. Mathematical models can help in developing better strategies to contain a pandemic. Considering multiple measures taken by African governments and challenging socio-economic factors, simple models cannot fit the data. We studied the dynamical evolution of COVID-19 in selected African countries. We estimated a time-dependent reproduction number, R 0 for each country studied to offer further insights into the spread of COVID-19 in Africa. We found that at the beginning the pandemic, R 0 \u2264 4 for all the countries studied; three months later, R 0 \u223c 1 with fluctuations in-between.",

An improved version of the SIR model is the SEIR model which proposes four stages: susceptible, exposed, infectious, and removed population densities [24] . Simple models for COVID-19 do not offer reliable insights or predictions to inform African policymakers [23] . The models become complex when one includes more socio-economic factors.

We show in Figure 5 that the number of cases are not correlated with the limited number of tests. The statistical samples used are significant; therefore, the conclusions are valid. One may extrapolate these results to the larger populations of the countries studied to determine, for example, the number of people to vaccinate. However, from the limited tests,",

We modeled the data from these countries with the SIDARTHE model, and extracted a time-dependent basic reproduction number for each country studied. Our studies showed that at the onset the pandemic, the basic reproduction numbers, R 0 < 4, for all the countries studied. The initial reactions of African governments and populations were effective to bring the basic reproduction number below one after a few weeks. Three months later, R 0 \u223c 1, with fluctuations in between-relaxation and difficulties to maintain the measures over time drove the basic reproduction number in a time-dependent cyclic pattern of rises and falls. We suggest that African countries find satisfactory economic supports for their most disadvantaged populations. This will encourage adherence to the containment plans. of COVID-19 data of Zambia. The uncertainties in these numbers result from the statistical uncertainties in data as shown in Figure 6 . Day 0 is March 18, 2020. The relative uncertainties are large-up to \u223c 80% at the onset of the pandemic, but decrease over time with more data to \u223c 10%.",

To compare data to the model, we defined the active cases as the sum of the recognized, threatened and ailing (or diagnosed) compartments-this is not an exact correspondence because of the complexity of the testing and counting procedures. In addition, the total cases also do not map directly to any stage of the model. In the data, the total cases are the sum of the active, recovered and dead cases. In the model, we built the total cases as the sum of the model active cases and healed and extinct compartments shown inFigure 1.After we defined the mapping of the data onto the model compartments or stages, we matched the model to the data by adjusting the model parameters depending on whether the active, recovered and/or dead cases were increasing or decreasing. We solved the eight differential equations in Eq. (1) by Euler discretization to estimate the parameters from best match between model and data. Subsequently, we computed R 0 according to Eq. (2). The result is an extraction of a time-dependent R 0 from the estimated parameters. Depending on the evolution of the pandemic and the responses measures imposed, the parameters in Equations 1 will change with time; therefore, R 0 , shown in Equation 2, will also change with time, as illustrated in the bottom plots ofFigures 2-6.",

From March 30 to May 11, 2020, schools and universities were closed. They imposed a total lockdown on the regions-Cotonou, Abomey-Calavi, Allada, Ouidah, S\u00e8m\u00e8-Podji, Porto-Novo, Akpro-Miss\u00e9r\u00e9t\u00e9 and Adjarra-most exposed to the pandemic. The government engaged in an awareness campaign through the media and the police force. They encouraged people to inform the authorities about anyone who returned to the country and did not self-isolate. From May 11, the government lifted the lockdown of the aforementioned regions and by June 2, and activities resumed with mandatory social distance and the wearing of masks. We collected the official data compiled by the government and modeled it as shown inFigure 2where one sees that there is a period between Day 54 and Day 61 where they posted no data. In the top panel ofFigure 2, there is a systematic shift in the data before Day 54 compared to after Day 61. This is because of the difference in the reporting of the test results. Before May 19, the government reported results of both the rapid diagnostic and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. After May 19, following the WHO guidelines, the government started reporting only the PCR test results, although they continued to perform the rapid diagnostic tests. We see a good match between the SIDARTHE model and the data. The bottom panel ofFigure 2shows the resulting time-dependent R 0 from the modeling.",

For the active cases, the agreement is good in the earlier and later time periods.

For the total cases, the model agrees with the data in the entire period shown. In the top right panel, we show the time evolutions of all the eight stages of the SIDARTHE model for Togo. The bottom left panel of Figure 5 shows the R 0 for Togo. We see that in first 2 weeks, R 0 was about three. It dropped in the subsequent few weeks because of the effectiveness of the containment measures and the social awareness campaign. However, after Day 40, the R 0 rose; this is because between May 5-20, the number of cases sharply increased when neighboring countries re-opened their borders. This led to an influx of imported cases from Togolese nationals that returned to Togo. The bottom right plot shows the number of daily tests and the active cases-the same active cases shown on the top left plot. The active cases show structures the distribution where, periodically, the cases increased or dropped. To model the data accurately, we tried to understand whether these structures were correlated with the number of daily tests or related to the dynamical evolution of the pandemic. As shown in the bottom right plot of Figure 5, we found no corrections between the number of daily tests and the active cases. Until Day 30, Togo reported only the total number of tests done, not the daily test numbers. In the bottom right panel of Figure 5, we see a flat distribution up to Day 30-we took an average by dividing the total number tests over the number of days.
