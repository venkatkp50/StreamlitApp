            "text": "The recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 disease, also known as COVID-19, has emerged as a pandemic. The unavailability of specific therapeutic drugs and vaccines urgently demands sincere efforts for drug discovery against COVID-19. The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a critical drug target as it plays an essential role in virus replication. Therefore for the identification of potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, we applied a structure-based virtual screening approach followed by molecular dynamics (MD) study. A library of 686 phytochemicals was subjected to virtual screening which resulted in 28 phytochemicals based on binding energy. These phytochemicals were further subjected to drug-likeness and toxicity analysis, which resulted in seven drug-like hits. Out of seven, five phytochemicals viz., Mpro-Dehydrtectol (-10.3 kcal/mol), Epsilon-viniferin (-8.6 kcal/mol), Peimisine (-8.6 kcal/ mol), Gmelanone (-8.4 kcal/mol), and Isocolumbin (-8.4 kcal/mol) were non-toxic. Consequently, these phytochemicals are subjected to MD, post MD analysis, and MM/PBSA calculations. The results of 100 ns MD simulation, RMSF, SASA, Rg, and MM/PBSA show that Epsilon-viniferin (-29.240 kJ/mol), Mpro-Peimisine (-43.031 kJ/mol) and Gmelanone (-13.093 kJ/mol) form a stable complex with Mpro and could be used as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. However, further investigation of these inhibitors against Mpro receptor of COVID-19 is needed to validate their candidacy for clinical trials.",

The reproduction of this virus in the host cell can be stopped by inhibiting the cleavage process. The viral genome codes for several non-structural proteins (NSP) including 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and its helicase, papainlike protease (papLpro), the structural glycoprotein, and accessory proteins (Boopathi et al., 2020) . Main protease (Mpro) has been reported as a potential drug target for SARS CoV-2 because it cuts the two replicate polyproteins required to mediate viral replication and transcription. Hence, Mpro can be used as a target for drug discovery to identify novel inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2. To discover a drug, the use of the computational technique for screening natural inhibitor is gaining attention among the researchers (Aanouz et al., 2020) . Some natural compounds such as Baicalein, Luteolin, Quercetin, and Kaempferol are potential antiviral agents against many vital viruses, including Dengue, HIV, H5N1 influenza A virus, Coxsackie virus, CHIKV, and Japanese encephalitis virus (Habbu et al., 2009) . So screening the natural compounds from medicinal plants is an excellent approach to find potential inhibitors against Mpro of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we selected the medicinal plants used in Chyawanprash for screening inhibitors of Mpro.",

The CHARMM 36 force field was applied to build the topology of ligand and protein (Vanommeslaeghe et al., 2009) . The dynamic behavior of all protein-ligand complexes was observed in the presence of explicit water molecules after solvation with the TIP3P water model in an orthorhombic periodic boundary box. To prevent interaction of the proteinligand complexes with the distance between the complex and the box wall was kept 10 \u00c5 and then add ions for neutralized the system. The energy of the prepared systems was minimized for 40,000 steps. The equilibrated system was then subjected to 10 ps simulation in NPT ensemble with 300 K temperature, constant pressure of 1 atm, and a time step of 2fs. Further, MD simulation was performed at a constant temperature of 300 K and a constant of 1 atm pressure using two fs for a 100 ns time scale. After successful completion of 100 ns MD simulation, the Root mean square deviation (RMSD), Root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), Radius of Gyration (Rg), SASA, and H-bond were calculated. This was done to quantify the strength of the interaction between protein-ligand complexes. We also computed the nonbonded interaction energy between protein and ligands with the same parameter as MD simulation.",
