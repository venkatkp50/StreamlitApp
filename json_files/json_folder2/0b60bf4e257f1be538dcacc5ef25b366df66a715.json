The model proposed by the present work supports the decision to prioritize victims of SAMU/192 regulating doctors, and focuses on the so-called level 1 (red code of absolute priority), since they have the highest number of occurrences.

However, only one ambulance is available to assist the victims. Given this scenario, when the regulatory protocols are not sufficient for the decision to prioritize victims, how to make the decision? What are the steps to be followed? Which victim to prioritize? When the protocol advises the ambulance to be sent and the doctor does not have the resources to care for the victims, what criteria would be used to assist this decision? The prioritization of victims must be carried out, making use of guiding criteria (protocols -dealing with criteria related to the victim's health status) and criteria that influence the decision-making process (criteria related to the health system; support tools; victims' details and external factors).",

In the Intercriteria evaluation with the information v j (a i ) , the information that considers the combination of the different criteria is sought, and to find it, it is necessary to choose a method of aggregating criteria [29] . When the criteria are represented by different units, it is necessary to normalize these values, so that they are redefined on a scale from 0 to 1. Prior to the final recommendation, sensitivity analyses can be carried out to investigate whether the preliminary conclusions are robust or whether they are sensitive to changes in aspects of the model [32] .",

As a result of the analyses of the specialist doctors and discussion group, different dimensions of criteria were created, guiding criteria, as well as, those that influence the prioritization of victims were analysed and considered. This knowledge from regulatory protocols, and from the experience of specialists, can support the decisions of regulatory physicians who are still newcomers. The conclusions of Perona et al. [49] corroborate with our findings, as he stated that there is a difference in the processes of thinking and storing information between specialists and novices. It was also observed that the structuring of the problem facilitated the decision makers' learning and understanding about the problem faced, about their own priorities, values and objectives of other parties. The exploration of this context was able to guide them in the identification of a course of action, and made it possible to learn about the twenty-five evaluation criteria. However, for prioritization in the four cases presented, only ten would be necessary, which were criteria related to the victim's health status, the victim's details and external factors. These criteria do not invalidate the others, as they may be necessary in different contexts, for prioritization, for instance in a psychiatric case, the criterion \"support from security agencies\" will be part of the decision.",

The modelling of preferences performed with the multicriteria FITradeoff method, pointed at victim 2 as the best choice, a result that was supported by experts and decision makers. Thus, the flexible and interactive Tradeoff process proved to be effective for prioritizing victims in this context. This result attested that the model was well structured and that the method was adequate to the [29] explains that a decision model corresponds to a simplified formal representation of the problem faced, supported by a multicriteria method.
