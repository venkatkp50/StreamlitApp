The outbreak started in China and rapidly spread worldwide, reaching devastating pandemic proportions with alarming morbidity and mortality [2] . Italy was among the countries majorly hit by COVID-19, with more than 4,241,760 laboratory-confirmed cases by 12 2 of 7 July 2021 and more than 126,924 deaths [3] . Following the COVID-19 outbreak, the Italian government adopted strict rules characterized by a national lockdown, from 10 March to 4 May 2020, a partial nationwide movement restriction, mandatory mask use and social distancing as an attempt to contain the virus diffusion [4] ; consequently, some changes in the pattern of hospital activities or admissions for cardiovascular conditions have been observed [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . A Syncope Unit (SU) is a facility featuring a standardized approach to the diagnosis and management of transient lack of consciousness (TLOC) and related symptoms, with dedicated staff and access to appropriate diagnostics and therapies [11] . The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on Syncope Units activities in Italy.",

Data about syncope unit activities including clinical and instrumental non-invasive evaluations, interventional cardiac procedures, type of SU admission and diagnosis were obtained from 10 Syncope Units, certified by the Italian Multidisciplinary Working Group on Syncope (GIMSI) throughout Italy, from 10 March 2020 to 31 December 2020 and compared within the same time frame in 2019. Assessed instrumental non-invasive examinations were all tests currently used for syncope evaluation according to the current guidelines [11] . Assessed cardiac pacing procedures were pacemaker (PM), implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) and implantable loop recorder (ILR) implantation. Moreover, the number of patients who underwent telemedicine follow-up visits and cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) remote monitoring follow-up visits were assessed. The admission to SU services was differentiated into outpatient visits, in-hospital consultancies and emergency department consultancies. The study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee and was in accordance with 1976 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. All data are presented as either number and percentage, in the case of categorical variables, or median and interquartile range (IQR) for what concerns continuous variables, after appropriately testing their distribution by the Shapiro-Wilk and Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit tests. Differences between variables were either assessed by the chi-square test for categorical variables or the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test. In addition, an appropriate Generalized Linear Model with Log-Linear Poisson regression for modeling count data was implemented to compute incidence rate ratios for all single procedures (reduction and increase rates, respectively). A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed by SPSS Software, Version 24 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) and STATA 14.0 software (StataCorp. 2015. College Station, TX, USA: StataCorp LP).",

The reduction of the emergency department admission rate for patients in need of an SU specialist evaluation might be explained by the fear of acquiring COVID-19 infection once hospitalized.",

            "text": "Our findings suggest that the COVID-19 lockdown was associated with a significant reduction rate in all the clinical activities of Syncope Units in Italy, including both noninvasive tests and cardiac invasive procedures. The remarkable changes in the SUs activities were more likely because of the reduction of patients referred from other hospital wards, which were converted into COVID-19 care centers; moreover, we noticed a reduction of outpatient accesses to SUs, mainly due to the Italian government's measures to contain SARS-CoV-2 diffusion. The reduction of the emergency department admission rate for patients in need of an SU specialist evaluation might be explained by the fear of acquiring COVID-19 infection once hospitalized.Our evidences support and enhance the data which described the reduction in the hospitalization rate for percutaneous coronary intervention [5, 6] and cardiac pacing procedures [7] [8] [9] [10] during the COVID-19 pandemic; moreover, our results suggest the hypothesis that the undiagnosed TLOC episodes may have contributed to the increase in non-COVID-19 out-of-hospital mortality in Italy [11] .The remarkable increasing use of remote monitoring for the follow-up of CIEDs recipients and the increasing telemedicine follow-up visits for patients who experienced TLOC and related symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown suggest that telehealth helped us to assure continuous care, reducing disease exposure for staff and physicians [12, 13] . In this sense, telehealth may also represent a tool to be further used in the future [14, 15] . The lack of an adequate reimbursement and the absence of sharing standards for CIEDs' remote monitoring or medical teleconsultation represent the most important reported barriers to the implementation of telehealth tools in the clinical practice [16] .",
