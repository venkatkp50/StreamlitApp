Therefore, outside the merger context, antitrust enforcers in the EU proceed against excessive prices only when such activity violates the discrete prohibitions of Articles 101 and 102 Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). 9 The European Commission has stated it is bound to come across cases where 'dominant businesses are exploiting their customers, by charging excessive prices or imposing unfair terms' 10 . In the same vein, National Competition Authorities (NCAs) have sanctioned exploitative abuses of dominance, especially in network industries recently liberalised. 11 However, what happens if the price gouging is genuinely unilateral and not collusive, due to an abnormal level of demand, in terms of both the number of consumers who desire the item and the sense of urgency that increases that desire? What happens if there is not only one dominant company in the market that sets excessive prices on goods and services in high demand? This article explores the provision of the EU competition law that the NCAs and the European Commission could possibly enforce against excessive pricing, in case the price gouging is not the outcome of a collusive agreement. It discusses the practical and conceptual difficulties that excessive pricing cases involve, especially under the current urgent circumstances that coronavirus has caused, and it assesses the remedies that the NCAs and the European Commission can impose in order to deal with price gouging. The article also recommends specific remedies that would be suitable to reset prices to a nonexcessive level in the time of coronavirus. In this context, it will also be discussed whether it is preferable for EU Member States in terms of flexibility and promptness to rely on price regulation, which is an inherently political activity, or not. An illustrative example is France, which has imposed a ceiling on the retail price of hand sanitisers but also on the wholesale price to third-party merchants, after the coronavirus outbreak. 12 Hence, the article is divided into six sections.",

These difficulties, as well as other practical hurdles that the European Commission and the NCAs will have to face under the current circumstances, if they want to rely on abuse of excessive pricing to fight price hikes, are discussed in the following section.

            "text": "The first step in an investigation to assess whether there is exploitative abuse of a collective dominant position by charging prices which are higher than they would be in a competitive market is whether the undertakings concerned are dominant or not. In order to assess dominance, it is essential to identify the boundaries of competition by defining the relevant product and geographic markets and then to see if each undertaking on the market enjoys a position of dominance. 24 If a company has a market share of less than 40 per cent, it is unlikely to be dominant. 25 The market share threshold, i.e. 40 per cent, which is required to establish the dominant position of a firm in the market, makes it quite difficult for NCAs to intervene with excessive pricing in the time of coronavirus. This is because the sellers of goods in high demand due to the coronavirus outbreak are often small businesses and they do not have a position of dominance in the market. 26 A counterargument to this seeming hurdle that NCAs could face is the European Commission's decision in ABG Oil case 27 , in which the European Commission relied for the first time on the concept of 'transitory market power' 28 . In that case, the oil crisis that took place in 1973-1974 made certain oil firms to increase their prices for crude oil and to reduce their production. In the prevailing circumstances of that case, the European Commission found that each of those companies was holding a dominant position relative to its customers and that their conduct constituted an abuse of their dominant position within the meaning of Article 86 of the EC Treaty. Specifically, the European Commission justified its decision about the dominant position of the oil firms on the following grounds: 'For reasons completely outside the control of the normal suppliers, their customers can become completely dependent on them for the supply of scarce products. Thus, while the situation continues, the suppliers are placed in a dominant position in respect of their normal customers' . 29 Though on appeal the above decision of the European Commission was annulled for lack of abuse, the Court of Justice did not challenge the question of dominance. 30 This means that the NCAs could possibly follow the same line of reasoning as the European Commission in the aforementioned decision and try to establish \"transitory market power\", in order to establish that the sellers of goods in high demand due to the coronavirus outbreak hold a dominant position in the relevant markets.",

The first limb of the test regards comparison of actual prices, i.e. the selling price of the product/service, with the actual costs, i.e. the production costs. The second part of the test considers whether the price imposed is either unfair in itself or when compared to the prices of competing products or prices across markets 34 Regarding the first limb of the test, it is not easy to calculate the difference between the production cost and the price of the product/service in order to identify the profit earned by the dominant firms. This is because the calculation of the difference requires the identification of the producer's costs, which is a complex, demanding and time-consuming operation, especially in case of a collective dominant position, where the firms to be examined by NCAs are more than just one. Nevertheless, 'firms' diverse production and market operations incur various categories of costs' 38 e.g. marginal cost, long-term average cost, total cost etc., which makes it difficult to decide which of the dominant firms' costs should be considered for the analysis of the excessive pricing. 39 Generally, the marginal cost of production 40 is a determinant of price in competitive conditions. 41 Yet, marginal costs raise complications and it is hard for antitrust enforcers to calculate them in both dynamic and static markets. 42 long-run welfare effects. 45 Additionally, even if we assume that, the identification of the dominant firms' production costs is eventually possible, this does not necessarily mean that dominant firms are cost-efficient. 46 The dominant firms' costs may be higher than they would normally be, due to cost inefficiencies. 47 This means that dominant firms' production costs will not be a credible benchmark for assessing whether there is excessive pricing or not. 48 Another major difficulty in assessing whether a price actually charged is excessive or not is the level of profit margin that should be acceptable, i.e. the maximum 'fair' price above which the price charged by dominant firms is excessive. 49 The European Commission and the ECJ have not set a threshold above which profits become excessive, as what may seem excessive profit in static industries, e.g. a margin of 25 per cent, may be legitimately justified in dynamic industries, where profit margins are usually much more significant. 50 However, as the case may be, the assessment of the profit margin should not concern NCAs too much, as many goods in high demand due to the coronavirus outbreak, like private label hand sanitisers, are being sold online for up to 5000 per cent more than the original price. 51 A last point that should be raised is that the assessment of excessive prices may be even more complicated in case of collective dominance, as the dominant firms may have different cost levels but they can still charge similar prices. 52 Likewise, the profit margins of less efficient firms may be lower than the ones of more efficient firms, but this does not necessarily mean the absence of excessive pricing. 53 either unfair in itself or when compared to the prices of competing products or prices across markets. In this way, the ECJ made available to NCAs several methods to analyse excessive pricing, which is good. Yet, it has been argued that applying these tests in times of crisis is not easy, firstly because the current economic value of the products in high demand due to the coronavirus outbreak is high and so this justifies their high prices. 55 Secondly, because the geographical benchmark, i.e. the method that compares the prices of the dominant firms with those of other firms in a different geographic market, is inadequate, as everywhere in Europe the prices of products in high demand due to the pandemic are currently high. 56 Though these arguments sound reasonable, it is submitted that they do not make impossible the application of Article 102 (a) TFEU to coronavirus profiteering. Regarding the first argument, what should be clarified is that the definition adopted in United Brands about an excessive price, i.e. 'a price that bears no reasonable relation to the economic value of the good or service, and is higher than such value' , cannot be taken literally. 57 This is because even a monopolist in the market would never want to charge more than the value of the product, as in that case consumers would not want to buy it. 58 'The most the dominant firm can do is exploit its consumers' willingness to pay' . 59 This means that an increase in the economic value of a product does not necessarily lead to a price exceeding the product's economic value to the consumers, because this would be economically detrimental to the relevant dominant firms in the market and would eventually result in low demand. This is also supported by the United Brands decision itself, which clarifies that:",

'To take advantage of an individual, benefitting from her misfortune, and benefitting disproportionately relative to one's contribution' is deemed exploitation. 61 The essence of exploitation is a failure to benefit the victim as much as fairness requires, and so even mutually advantageous transactions can be exploitative and wrong. 62 Regarding the second argument, it should be noted that the various methods of analysing excessive pricing are compatible with each other and the NCAs can apply them in parallel, when possible, for a robust result. 63 This means that if the geographical benchmark is not appropriate under the current circumstances, the NCAs are not barred from using the historical benchmark, for example, which enables comparison over time in order to determine whether a price is unfair or not. The historical benchmark will be particularly useful for NCAs in case they want to take measures against the excessive pricing caused by the coronavirus outbreak. Moreover, for the purposes of Article 102 (a) TFEU, the comparison with competing products is not limited to the products/services strictly within the same market. It is possible for NCAs to consider a wider range of products/services, as long as they are comparable and there is effective competition between the dominant undertakings at issue and their competitors. 64 This approach gives NCAs flexibility and easiness to analyse excessive pricing in times of crisis, such as the current ones.",

Coronavirus has a chilling effect on investments and thereby reduces new entries to the markets. Structural measures, such as the removal or prohibition of entry barriers to the market, require prior investigation by the NCA about the causes of excessive pricing. This kind of investigation needs time and resources, which means that the NCAs cannot take urgent action and apply promptly the relevant remedies. Besides, free entry does not eliminate by itself and immediately the power of incumbent firms in the market. 71",

            "text": "At EU level, a good alternative to fines would be the issuance of 'commitment decisions' 72 by the European Commission, in order to motivate the relevant firms to set lower prices in the future and offer conditions that are more convenient for consumers. The European Commission can issue 'commitment decisions' when it intends to adopt a decision requiring that an infringement be brought to an end, and the companies under investigation prefer to offer commitments in order to remove the European Commission's competition concerns as expressed in a preliminary assessment. 73 'Commitment decisions' may also be preferable if the case is not one where a fine would be appropriate or when efficiency reasons justify that, the Commission limits itself to making the commitments binding, and does not issue a formal prohibition decision. 74 The reasons why 'commitment decisions' could be a good remedy for excessive pricing under the current circumstances is that they can restore undistorted conditions of competition in the markets in a swift and effective manner, as the administrative process for commitment decisions is generally short. 75 'Commitment decisions' can be either behavioural or structural and can be limited in time, meaning that the European Commission is able to reassess them if a material change takes place in the meantime. 76 They do not establish an infringement and do not require any admission by the parties, as they only require commitment to future behaviour. 77 This can be an incentive for firms to pursue the commitment route, as they know that in this way they avoid any damage to their reputation as well as a formal finding of an infringement against them. In addition, the ECJ does not require a strict proportionality test for assessing the remedies imposed by the European Commission in a 'commitment decision' , as it would do in case of a prohibition decision. 78 If a firm does not comply with the 'commitment decision' , the European Commission is able to impose a fine up to 10 per cent of the firm's annual turnover without having to prove any violation of the competition rules. 79 From the viewpoint of the European Commission, this provision saves money and time. Moreover, the European Commission is able to impose periodic penalty payments of up to 5 per cent of the average daily turnover of a firm until it complies with the 'commitment decision' . 80",

            "text": "Given the above conceptual and practical difficulties that the NCAs and the European Commission may encounter in excessive pricing cases, competition law enforcement may be a rather risky and time-consuming form of intervention. Therefore, some countries like France 81 and Cyprus 82 proceeded to regulatory pricing frameworks in order to cap the wholesale and retail prices of some products in high demand due to the coronavirus pandemic. In the United States, many states have already laws against price gouging, which apply to actions taken during times of disaster or emergency and they regard certain classes of items, generally those that are necessary for survival or for coping with the problems caused by a disaster. 83 Hence, after explaining what price regulation means, this section is going to discuss the disadvantages and advantages of a regulatory pricing framework in order to see if, after all, it is preferable to competition law enforcement. Price regulation refers to 'regulatory methods of determining and imposing controls on firms of industries' with the aim of restricting independent price setting. 84 This may involve a fixed price or rate of return, a maximum price ceiling, or minimum price floor. 85 The use of price controls and price caps has been generally criticised for being in contrast with competition policy for various reasons. 86 Within neoclassical economics, the free formation of prices, which relies on the interaction of supply and demand, is essential to the effective functioning of competitive markets and the efficient allocation of society's resources. 87 This is because price is 'the most immediate parameter upon which undertakings compete' , it shows whether demand exceeds supply and it makes consumers estimate the value that a good or service holds for them. 88 Moreover, it is rather complex and difficult to determine a regulated price, as it must secure on the one hand the incentives of firms to keep on operating efficiently in the market, without distorting the optimal supply and demand levels, on the other hand the firms' profits, which should be neither excessive nor unviable. 89 Furthermore, from fairness perspective, it has been argued that price regulations do not take into account, as they should, the increased costs that the sellers might face because of the same crisis or disaster which put their customers in difficulty. 90 According to this argument, the firms should not absorb the increased costs in order to benefit the consumers, particularly when the former have exercised good foresight and responsibility in obtaining a ready stock of goods that might be necessary in case of a crisis or a disaster. 91 This argument holds truth today and in order to deal with this issue, the author suggests that price regulations should be flexible enough to enable price increases above the relevant price ceiling, in case the increased price is attributable to increased costs that the seller had to bear.",

For instance, in the exceptional case of urgent needs, firms may set excessive prices for the necessary goods that are specifically important for the consumers' health and wellbeing. This may result in a transfer of wealth from consumers to suppliers as well as in a reduction in total welfare to society. 97 The above exploitative nature of excessive pricing is like parallel accommodating conduct, where 'each rival's response to competitive moves made by others is individually rational, and not motivated by retaliation or deterrence nor intended to sustain an agreed-upon market outcome, but nevertheless emboldens price increases and weakens competitive incentives to reduce prices or offer customers better terms' . 98 Therefore, this behavioural exploitation can arguably justify regulatory intervention in the price formation process, as society should undertake the responsibility of protecting its members in time of crisis from this kind of conducts.",

The analysis showed that there are a number of difficulties of proof associated with finding an exploitative abuse of collective dominant position. Some of these difficulties include the market share threshold, which shall be 40 per cent and more, the calculation of the difference between the dominant firms' production costs and the price of the product/service, as well as the several methods used to analyse excessive pricing. Despite all these hurdles, which are underlined by the fact that NCAs are in a rush to respond to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, it was explained that the application of Article 102 (a) TFEU to coronavirus profiteering is still possible. One of the suggested solutions to overcome these hurdles was the acknowledgement of a 'transitory market power' , as the European Commission had done in ABG Oil case. In this way, it would be possible for NCAs to establish that even small businesses, which do not have a position of dominance in the market, hold a temporary position of market strength in the relevant market. This is because these firms sell goods in high demand due to the coronavirus 102 ",

The discussion focused on the imposition of fines to firms, which is a behavioural remedy that does not ensure the resetting of prices to a 'non-excessive level' . Therefore, the article argued the issuance of 'commitment decisions' by the European Commission, as a good alternative to fines. The 'commitment decisions' can address directly the excessive pricing in the time of coronavirus at the EU level, rather than merely alleviating its harmful effects.Finally, the article dealt with the prospect of price regulation and examined to what extent it could be a good alternative to competition law enforcement. The discussion showed that price regulation is a much-disputed enterprise in contemporary regulatory practice, but the pragmatism calls for it, especially in the absence of selfcorrecting excessive prices.doi:10.1093/jeclap/lpaa029",
