            "text": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel infectious disease that is in rapid growth. Several trials are going on worldwide to find a solution for this pandemic. The viral replication can be blocked by inhibiting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SARS-CoV-2 RBD Spro) and the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (SARS-CoV-2 Mpro). The binding of potential small molecules to these proteins can inhibit the replication and transcription of the virus. The spice molecules that are used in our food have antiviral, antifungal and antimicrobial properties. As spice molecules are consumed in the diet, hence its antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2 will benefit in a significant manner. Therefore, in this work, the molecular docking of 30 selected spice molecules (screened through ADME property) was performed to identify the potential inhibitors for the RBD Spro and Mpro of SARS-CoV-2. We have found that though all the molecules bind actively with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD Spro and Mpro, but Piperine has the highest binding affinity among the 30 screened molecules. Besides, the comparative study between Piperine and currently used drugs show that Piperine is more effective. The interaction of Piperine with RBD Spro and Mpro is further validated by the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies. The free energy landscape and binding free energy results also, support for the stable complex formation of Piperine with RBD Spro and Mpro. We anticipate immediate wet-lab experiments and clinical trials in support of this computational study that might help to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 virus.",

            "text": "The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a major threat worldwide due to its fast-spreading nature. This disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The entry of this coronavirus to the host cell is mediated through the transmembrane spike glycoproteins (Hasan et al., 2020) . This glycoprotein consists of two subunits and is reported to have a similar affinity to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which in turn results in efficient spreading of SARS-CoV-2 in humans (Walls et al., 2020) . The spike glycol protein binds to its receptor human ACE2 by its receptor-binding domain (RBD) and is activated proteolytically by human protease (Shang et al., 2020) . The interaction of the RBD of the spike glycoprotein to ACE2 is carried out by ARG403, TYR453, SER494, TYR495, PHE497, GLN498, THR500, ASN501, TYR505 residues of spike glycoprotein (Lan et al., 2020) . The interaction of RBD Spro to ACE2 can be inhibited by the small molecules that interact with the above residues of RBD spike protein (Spro). On the other hand, the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), also known as chymotrypsin-like protease, or 3-C-like protease (3CL pro ), plays a vital role in processing the polyproteins through the translation of viral RNA. This protease is reported to have a minimum of 11 cleavage sites resulting in viral replication and toxicity . The inhibition of these two viral targets can actively block the fusion and replication of SARS-CoV-2.",

            "text": "Currently, researchers are working globally for finding treatment for this disease in identifying a specific drug or vaccine that can inhibit viral replication at the earliest possible. The devastation of this disease is vividly seen from the data on the WHO website, which shows the infected patient number more than 245 lakhs and casualties more than 8 lakhs, worldwide from 216 countries, and still, it is continuing (https://www.who. int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019, 29 August 2020). Currently, there are no approved drugs and vaccines for the treatment of COVID-19, but a few drugs such as remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, etc. are under restricted use in case of emergency (Magagnoli et al., 2020) . Meanwhile, the computational tools, molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) have gained attention as essential tools to investigate potential inhibitor molecules (Anurag et al., 2020; Gupta et al., 2020; Sourav et al., 2020) . Choy et al. reported in-vitro studies showing remdesivir, lopinavir, emetine and homoharringtonine inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication (Choy et al., 2020) . Similarly, Wang et al. reported the inhibition property of remdesivir and chloroquine against novel coronavirus . In addition to different drug compounds, researchers also searched for natural molecules having antiviral activity. Natural constituents from foods, spices, herbs are also being found to have anti-infective properties. In this context, small active molecules present in natural products and their derivatives have gained tremendous attention as a source of therapeutic agents due to structural diversity for many years.",

The compound of essential garlic oil, a spice used in food, is reported as an inhibitor using the molecular docking method (Thuy et al., 2020) . There are several recent studies on the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 using many different natural and antiviral molecules (Al-Khafaji et al., 2020; Joshi et al., 2020; D. Kumar, Kumari, et al., 2020; Muralidharan et al., 2020) . Recently, Das et al., using blind molecular docking, investigated for the potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (Sourav et al., 2020) . Molecules studied by Das et al. are drug molecules, antivirals, antifungals, anti-nematodals and anti-protozoals in addition to natural compounds. Besides, natural molecules such as alkaloids and terpenoids from African medicinal plants were studied by Gyebi et al. for the inhibition property against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (Gyebi et al., 2020) . Recently, Umesh et al. screened compounds from Indian spices as potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (Umesh et al., 2020) . Every spice has a particular aroma, colour and flavour due to the presence of specific molecules in them, and also, have antiviral properties (Aboubakr et al., 2016; Astani et al., 2010; Brochot et al., 2017; Chang et al., 2013; Choi, 2016; Mair et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2014) . These properties of the spice molecules compel us to conduct the present study, where we investigated the inhibition property of molecules present in various spices against the SARS-CoV-2 RBD Spro and SARS-Cov-2 Mpro using molecular docking and MD simulation studies. The compounds tested and their source of origin with PubChem ID are listed in Supplementary  Table S1 .",

This technique helps to enhance the success rate of an experiment and cuts down the experimental cost. Hence, the molecular docking study can help to analyse the possible binding pose of a small molecule on the active site of a macromolecule. Here we used molecular docking to screen some biologically active spice molecules with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD Spro and SARS-Cov-2 Mpro. The molecule with the highest binding affinity to RBD Spro and Mpro was subjected to MD simulation for further validation.",

The CHARMM36 forcefield (Huang & MacKerell, 2013) was used for the simulation of the systems. The topology parameters for the ligand molecule were obtained from CGenFF (Vanommeslaeghe & MacKerell, 2012) . A dodecahedron simulation box filled with TIP3P water model (Price & Brooks, 2004) was prepared. Counter ions were added to maintain the electrical neutrality of the system. The systems were kept at a buffer concentration of 0.15 M. Then, the build systems were energy minimized with 50,000 steps using the steepest descent algorithm. Then the systems were equilibrated under NVT and NPT ensembles for 100 ps at 300 K temperature and 1 atm pressure before the production run. After the equilibration, a production run of 100 ns was incorporated under the NPT ensemble. For long-range electrostatic interaction, particle mesh Ewald (PME) (Darden et al., 1993) and for van der Waals interactions, the force-switching scheme was used. Besides, for temperature and pressure coupling, the Berendsen thermostat (Berendsen et al., 1984) with velocity rescaling and Parrinello-Rahman barostat (Parrinello & Rahman, 1981) with isotropic rescaling were used, respectively. The simulation time step was set to 2 fs, and the trajectories were recorded at every 10 ps. The simulation data were analysed by analysing the root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), number of hydrogen bonds and radius of gyration (Rg) using Gromacs analysis tools. The principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using the g_covar, g_anaeig and g_sham tools of Gromacs. The data were exported to origin 9.0 and plotted for further analysis purposes.",

The study of the MEP surface can provide information about the active site of the macromolecule with the indication of relative ligand orientation and nature of the active site at which an approaching electrophile is attracted (Politzer et al., 1985) . In a biological macromolecule, the electrostatic potential surface is plotted by analysing the electron-rich and deficient regions of the molecule. The detailed insight at the molecular label helps to predict the potentiality of the ligands to take part in chemical reactions and their mechanism of interaction. The MEP surface representation of SARS-CoV-2 RBD Spro and Mpro ligand-binding sites with the simultaneous presence of all docked molecules are provided in Supplementary Figure S2 . The electronically poor regions (blue) are referred to as positive potential, whereas the dense electron regions (red) are at a negative potential, and the white zones are considered as neutral. From the figure, it is observed that most of the selected molecules actively bound at the red regions that are referred to as highly negative electrostatic potential regions. This implies that the molecules are polar and can actively take part in the binding process with stable interactions, which in turn could help to block the viral replication.",

The significant parameters that quantify the pharmacokinetics of a drug are its ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) properties (Jang et al., 2001) . All the molecules subjected to ADME tests are qualified for drug approval with their high value of gastrointestinal (GI) absorption (Daina & Zoete, 2016) , which in turn implies for their use as an oral drug. Table 1 represents the pharmacokinetic properties of the proposed drug candidates. The passive GI absorption and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeation is a fundamental criterion for the distribution of the drug molecules. From Table 1 , it is observed that all the ligand molecules are BBB permeant that implies their underlying distribution index. The high negative skin permeable coefficient (Kp) values indicate a less skin permeability that is useful for their transdermal delivery. The interaction of the drug molecules with cytochromes P450 (CYP) is an essential property as they play a crucial role in drug elimination through biotransformation metabolism. The noninhibition of CYP isoforms such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 disclose that these molecules are not the substrate for these enzymes that resembles for the lower degradation rate of these molecules, which will make it effectively available for blocking the SARS-CoV-2 RBD Spro and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The synthetic accessibility values suggest the facile synthesis of these molecules. All these parameters infer these close to drug-like molecules, which may be used as successful drug candidates.",

The docked poses of the four ligand molecules (Piperine, Capsaicin, Gingerol and Terpinen-4-ol) along with their 2D interaction diagram having the highest binding affinity, among the selected molecules, are presented in descending order in Figure 3 . From Table 1 , it is observed that these four molecules follow the trend for their binding affinity with Piperine (\u00c06.4 kcal/ mol) at the highest, then Capsaicin, Ginerol and Terpinen-4ol (all having \u00c05.5 kcal/mol) among all the selected molecules. From Figure 3 (a), it is observed that Piperine is associated with hydrogen bond interaction with GLY164 and GLY170. TYR173 (TYR505) and SER162 (SER494) are involved with pi-pi T-shaped and carbon-hydrogen bond interactions, respectively.

From Table 1 , it is seen that Piperine has the highest affinity at the binding site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro among all the selected molecules, which is similar to the case of SARS-CoV-2 RBD Spro. The DG value, known as binding free energy, for the four molecules having the highest affinity among all the selected molecules, along with their 2D interaction diagram, is given in Figure 4 .

The computed value of binding free energy for RBD Spro-Piperine is found to be \u00c05.533 \u00b1 0.839 kJ/mol, and for Mpro-Piperine is \u00c037.971 \u00b1 0.271 kJ/mol.

In contrast, polar energy has a positive contribution to the whole interaction process.

From Figure 9(a,b) , it is observed that both the Spro-Piperine and Mpro-Piperine are less flexible as compared to unbound proteins since they covered less conformational space. It concludes that the ligand-bound forms are more stable as compared to the unbound proteins. The principal components obtained were used as the reaction coordinates to find the Gibbs free energy landscape (Figure 9 ) to visualize the energy minima of the unbound protein as well as the protein-ligand complex. From Figure  9 (c-f), it is observed that both the ligand-bound proteins have less Gibbs-free energy values than the unbound proteins indicating their stability and energetically favourable conformational transitions. The shape and size of the minimum energy area (blue colour) in case of RBD Spro-Piperine and Mpro-Piperine are more as compared to the unbound proteins RBD Spro and Mpro, which suggests the ligandbound forms are thermodynamically more favourable.",

From the docking results, it is observed that the Piperine molecule is the best candidate for the inhibition of the RBD Spro and the Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 among the selected 30 molecules. To observe the effectiveness of Piperine over currently used drugs, we carried out the docking study of a few drug molecules such as chloroquine, favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, oseltamivir, remdesivir and ribavirin using the same docking protocol as followed for the 30 spice molecules. From the docking score, it is found that Piperine performed better as compared to the currently used drugs stated above. The lowest energy pose of a few presently used drugs with their 2D interaction diagram is provided in Supplementary Figures S5  and S6 corresponding to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and RBD Spro, respectively. A comparison of the lowest energy dock scores of these drug molecules along with Piperine is also provided in Table 2 . The MD simulation results reveal that Piperine actively inhibits both the RBD Spro and Mpro by binding to their active sites. Piperine binds on the active site of the RBD Spro with those residues by which it interacts with ACE2. So, the binding of Piperine on that site may potentially cease the interaction tendency of RBD Spro with ACE2. Similarly, the interaction of Piperine on the active site of the Mpro may inhibit its viral replication. From the docking and MD results, we conclude that Piperine forms a very stable complex with RBD Spro and Mpro and shows better affinity as compared to the currently used drugs that are mentioned above against SARS-CoV-2.",

It is observed that all the proposed spice molecules qualified the ADME test with their suitable pharmacokinetic properties to be useful as a drug candidate. The docking study is revealed that all the molecules actively take part in binding to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD Spro and Mpro with their low or high value of binding affinity. This binding of these molecules will help to inhibit the replication of the viral proteins with specific hindrances upon their mutarotation. For both the viral targets, Piperine performed well with its highest binding affinity of \u00c06.4 and \u00c07.3 kcal/mol for SARS-CoV-2 RBD Spro and Mpro, respectively. Besides, Piperine is also found more effective as compared to a few of the currently used drugs. The MD simulation study is supported for the stable interaction of Piperine with SARS-Cov-2 RBD Spro and Mpro. The PCA and binding free energy results also suggest for the active participation of Piperine in stable complex formation with RBD Spro and MPro. Hence, the study proposes Piperine as an active molecule for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Since this study is performed computationally, it requires wet-lab experiments in-vitroas well as in-vivofor further validation.",
