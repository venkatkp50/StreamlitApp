It bodes ill for the current COVID-19 pandemic that is likely to get out of hand in regions where mass violence is becoming the new norm. 2 As a prime example, COVID-19 vaccine coverage in Ukraine is estimated to be around 33%. 3 The rampant spread of the virus through stressed and immunocompromised populations risks the emergence of newer variants that will threaten the whole of the world. Other health issues such as tuberculosis are also major concerns in the regions facing mass migration. 3 Goal 4 that covers universal education. An insecure world cannot develop science, justice, or even basic human rights. Lack of health facilities and education can cripple nations for generations. Scientists throughout the world are now uniting to condemn mass violence, offer decent jobs for displaced professionals, and allow them to preserve basic human rights. 4 The global scientific community should take a proactive stance to condemn instability and call for offering better options for education and science for all. Continuing professional development (CPD) needs to be adjusted to the current realities linked to the COVID-19 pandemic and socioeconomic instability.",
