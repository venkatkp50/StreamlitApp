Their use in the setting of COVID-19 has been heavily debated due to potential interactions with ACE2, an enzyme that links the pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory arms of the renin angiotensin system, but also the entryway by which severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) invades cells. ACE2 expression is altered by age, hypertension, diabetes, and the virus itself. This study integrated available information about the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) and effects of SARS-CoV-2 and its comorbidities on ACE2 into a mechanistic mathematical model and aimed to quantitatively predict effects of ACEi/ARBs on the RAAS pro-inflammatory/ anti-inflammatory balance. RAAS blockade prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection is predicted to increase the mas-AT1 receptor occupancy ratio up to 20-fold, indicating that in patients already taking an ACEi/ARB before infection, the anti-inflammatory arm is already elevated while the pro-inflammatory arm is suppressed. Predicted proinflammatory shifts in the mas-AT1 ratio due to ACE2 downregulation by SARS-CoV-2 were small relative to antiinflammatory shifts induced by ACEi/ARB. Predicted effects of changes in ACE2 expression with comorbidities of diabetes, hypertension, or aging on mas-AT1 occupancy ratio were also relatively small. Last, predicted changes in the angiotensin (Ang(1-7)) production rate with ACEi/ARB therapy, comorbidities, or infection were all small relative to exogenous Ang(1-7) infusion rates shown experimentally to protect against acute lung injury, suggesting that any changes in the ACE2-Ang(1-7)-mas arm may not be large enough to play a major role in COVID-19 pathophysiology.",

            "text": "debate around the use of these drugs in patients with COVID-19. On one hand, it has been speculated that these therapies may increase susceptibility or severity of COVID-19, but conversely, it has also been speculated that they may protect against excess inflammation following COVID-19 infection. 4 The limited clinical data currently available do not seem to support evidence of harm. [5] [6] [7] The American College of Cardiology, Heart Failure Association of America, and American Heart Association have issued a joint statement urging continued use of ACEis or ARBs as standard of care, while also urging additional research into any potential interactions with COVID-19 infection. 8 However, the speculation and uncertainty among patients and healthcare providers regarding the most commonly used antihypertensive drug classes in the United States could have significant public health consequences. 9 The debate around protective or harmful mechanisms of ACEis/ARBs arise from speculation about their interactions with ACE2, the membrane-bound protein by which the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus invades the body. 10 ACE2 plays a normal physiological role as an enzyme in the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS; Figure 1a ). The classic arm of the RAAS, in which angiotensin I (AngI) is converted to AngII by ACE and then binds to the AT1 receptor, promotes vasoconstriction, sodium retention, and inflammation. AngII binding to the AT2 receptor appears to counter some of these effects. 11 A second arm opposes the effects of AT1. In this arm, AngI and AngII are converted to Ang(1-7) by neprilysin and ACE2, respectively. Ang (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) suppresses inflammation by binding to the mas receptor (a G-protein coupled receptor of Ang(1-7) associated with anti-inflammatory effects of the RAAS). 12 It has been hypothesized that ACEis/ARBs could increase risk or severity of COVID-19 by increasing ACE2 expression and thus providing more routes for viral entry. 13 However, ACE2 has not been established as a rate-limiting step for viral entry. In addition, a recent review of experimental studies found little consistency among studies reporting changes in ACE2 expression with ACEi/ ARB treatment. 14 Some studies found increased ACE2 expression/ activity with ACEi or ARB treatment, whereas a plurality showed little to no effect, and a few even showed decreased expression.",

            "text": "On the other hand, it has also been hypothesized that ACEis/ ARBs could mitigate the severity of COVID-19 by suppressing inflammation. Although much is unknown about the pathophysiology of COVID-19, the degree of severity appears to depend on the strength of the host's inflammatory response triggered by the infection. 15 Suppression of the classic AngI-AngII-AT1 pathway may shift the balance toward the anti-inflammatory Ang(1-7)-mas arm of the RAAS. Infusion of Ang(1-7) has been shown to reduce acute lung injury and inflammation in animal models of acute respiratory distress syndrome, 16 whereas downregulation of pulmonary ACE2 is associated with increased lung injury severity. [17] [18] [19] Part of the challenge in understanding the effect of ACEis and ARBs on the inflammatory balance in COVID-19 is that ACE2 expression is altered by other factors. Hypertension, diabetes, and aging have all been shown to alter ACE2 expression. [20] [21] [22] [23] The SARS-CoV-2 virus itself also induces ACE2 shedding and downregulation after cellular entry, and ACE2 expression is also downregulated by the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself, which may play a role in the excessive inflammatory response in some patients. 24 SARS viruses have a higher affinity to ACE2 and shed ACE2 with higher efficiency than other coronaviruses, and the structure of SARS-CoV-2 suggests that it binds with higher affinity than other SARS viruses. 25 This may contribute to both its increased transmissibility and then subsequently to increased disease severity.

As shown in Figure 4 , the predicted effects of 95% ACE2 downregulation induced by SARS on AT1, mas, and the mas-AT1 ratio are small relative to the effects of ACEi and ARB therapy. Both ACEis and ARBs increase mas while decreasing AT1, thus dramatically increasing the ratio of two. although ACE and ARBs are predicted to have similar effects on the mas-AT1 ratio, ACEis are predicted to increase mas to a greater extent, whereas ARBs are predicted to suppress AT1 further. Figure S6 explores the effect of variability in four RAAS enzymes (ACE, ACE2, NEP, and renin) on the mas-AT1-ratio. Mas-AT1 ratio is positively correlated with ACE, negatively correlated with NEP, and is not correlated ACE2 or renin. ACE and NEP are correlated with appear to affect the baseline mas-AT1 ratio (prior to infection) much more than ACE2 or renin. This is true both before and after treatment with ARBs and ACEis. There is no obvious effect of enzyme This suggests that changes in ACE2 expression due to comorbidities, like diabetes, hypertension, or aging, may be less important than the effects of these comorbidities on other enzymes in the RAAS, particularly ACE and NEP. As described early, we estimated that ACE expression is 10 and 30 times higher than NEP and ACE2 expression. ACE expression has been shown to change with disease. 20, 38 Thus, even though ACE2 is the enzyme involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection of the cell, ACE expression levels may be more important in determining the relative pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory balance of a subject prior to infection.",

Figure 5 shows the simulated Ang(1-7) production rates, before and after infection, with and without ACEi or ARB therapy, relative to the Ang(1-7) infusion rates used in experimental studies. Although the Ang(1-7) production rate was increased by therapy and decreased by the virus, in all cases, the changes were much smaller than the rates necessary to produce benefits in experimental lung injury, and were similar to a rate which was found by Zambelli et al. to produce no benefits. 16 This suggests that although ACEis or ARBs may shift the balance toward the anti-inflammatory arm of the RAAS, this effect may not be sufficient to produce a therapeutic effect. This may explain why several observational studies have found no difference in outcomes between subjects with COVID-19 who are or are not on RAAS therapies. 41 Figure 5 Simulated changes in Ang(1-7) production rate (bars) with ACEi or ARB treatment, and with infection-induced ACE2 downregulation, are small relative to rates of Ang(1-7) infusion rates found to elicit protection from lung injury in experimental models (dashed lines 16, 39, 40 ACEi/ARBs have been proposed to potentially increase ACE2.

Some parameters, such as plasma renin activity, AngI, AngII, and Ang(1-7) have well-defined clinical ranges. Renin halflife has been measured in multiple studies, whereas the values for enzyme catalytic efficiencies and receptor binding affinities were based on single in vitro studies. Expression of ACE, ACE2, and neprilysin vary across tissue and cell types, and across species, and thus are much more difficult to quantify. Thus, it was necessary to determine these enzyme concentrations using mathematical constraints and estimating their ratios by fitting experimental data for peptides that are more easily measurable. Thus, there is the highest degree of certainty in values for AngI, AngII, Ang(1-7), and PRA, whereas uncertainty is greatest for the ACE-ACE2 and ACE-NEP ratios. Although there is uncertainty around these enzyme ratios, sensitivity analysis showed that predictions of changes in AT1, AT2, and mas receptor occupancy are robust to inaccuracies in parameter values. Thus, the conclusions of this analysis are unlikely to be impacted if the values used for these ratios are not accurate.",

There are several key conclusions from this analysis. First, our simulations indicate that ACEi/ARB treatment prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection increases the ratio of mas to AT1 receptor occupancy many fold. Thus, in patients already taking an ACEi/ARB before infection, the anti-inflammatory arm of the RAAS would already be much more dominant. Second, effects of changes in ACE2 expression with comorbidities of diabetes, hypertension, or aging on the mas-AT1 receptor ratio are relatively small, compared with the effects of ACEis/ARBs. Changes in ACE expression are predicted to be more important than ACE2 in determining the baseline inflammatory/pro-inflammatory balance of the RAAS. Third, pro-inflammatory shifts in the mas-AT1 ratio due to ACE2 downregulation by SARS-CoV-2 infection are predicted to be small relative to anti-inflammatory shifts induced by ACEi/ARB. Last, predicted changes in the Ang(1-7) production rate with ACEi/ ARB therapy, comorbidities, or infection were all small relative to the exogenous Ang(1-7) infusion rates shown experimentally to protect against acute lung injury, suggests that changes in the ACE2-Ang(1-7)-mas arm may not be large enough to play a major role in COVID-19 pathophysiology.",
