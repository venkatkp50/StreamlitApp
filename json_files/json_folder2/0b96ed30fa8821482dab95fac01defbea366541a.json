PwCF have a shorter lifespan than the general population, with a median age of survival in the range of 40-55 years and the median age at death of 31.2 years [22] .

Testing rates by age group are not available from the ECDC.

Fourth, comparing incidence by country (either in our study or in other published reports) is difficult due to differing impacts of the pandemic, case definitions and public health measures between countries. Fifth, pwCF and their families are expert in infection control. Anecdotal evidence suggests that they took early action to avoid infection and effectively started lockdown or shielding earlier than it was imposed in countries across Europe to proactively avoid infection [25] .

Upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, lung-transplanted pwCF were more frequently symptomatic, were admitted to hospital 1.7-fold more frequently and required intensive care 8-fold more frequently than pwCF without lung transplant.

            "text": "Our study had several limitations, as well as the caveats related to testing and incidence discussed above. Throughout the study period, countries had differing impact of the pandemic and heterogeneous access to testing. Case definitions were also heterogeneous between countries, as reflected in the different case definitions in published studies in CF [5, 7, 19, 21] . Reporting to ECFSPR was voluntary, therefore cases may be under-reported with possible selection bias for more severe cases. In addition, ECFSPR has low coverage in some countries, especially in Eastern Europe [12] . Since these countries reported a low incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in the general population during our study period, we do not believe this to be problematic. However, it could however skew future updates of incidence, as SARS-CoV-2 cases have risen significantly in these countries since summer 2020, whether through increased testing or increased impact of the pandemic. The denominator for calculating SARS-CoV-2 incidence in pwCF was from the 2018 ECFSPR report. It is possible that the CF population has increased since then. In some countries and regions, lung transplanted pwCF are treated by another care team or at another hospital. Therefore, it is possible that some lung-transplanted pwCF no longer participate in ECFSPR and the number of infections in pwCF living with a transplant could be under-reported here. Of note, pwCF from 11 countries in our study were also included in the global study [7] and in national or centerbased studies [5, 19, 21, 32] in pwCF.",

Although more data are required to confirm these findings, it is clear that SARS-CoV-2 infection can result in severe illness and death for pwCF, especially for those with lung transplants. PwCF should continue to protect their health by shielding and maintaining good adherence to treatments and exercise. Governments should prioritize pwCF of all ages for vaccination, by listing CF as an underlying condition with an increased risk of more severe disease.",
