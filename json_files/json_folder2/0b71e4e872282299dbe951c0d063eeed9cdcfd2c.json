ES represents up to 7% of AIHA and around 2% of ITP. Studies have found that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may be associated with various hematological complications, i.e., coagulopathies; however, finding of Evans syndrome is a novel case.",

            "text": "Evans syndrome (ES), which was first described in 1951, is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the development of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and/or immune neutropenia simultaneously or consecutively in the absence of any underlying cause [1] . The precise pathophysiology is not entirely understood; it is believed that dysregulation of the immune system is a primary contributor to the condition. It is classified as primary and secondary. Primary Evans syndrome with no cause is very rare and is seen in children. Secondary Evans syndrome may be associated with or show other diseases or conditions such as autoimmune disorders, lymphoproliferative disorders, or primary immunodeficiencies [2] , viral infections including hepatitis C, cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster, and Epstein-Barr viruses [3, 4] . ES is one of the rare presenting features of autoimmune disorders, especially systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Evans syndrome occurs in patients with severe multisystem SLE manifestations and sometimes may even precede the onset of disease [5] . ES is a rare condition because it is diagnosed in only 0.8 to 3.7% of all patients with either ITP or AIHA at onset. The clinical features include fatigue, pallor, jaundice, ecchymosis, petechiae, gingivorrhagia, epistaxis and mucosal bleeding, with remissions and exacerbations during the person's lifetime, and acute manifestations as catastrophic bleeding and massive hemolysis [6] . As in other autoimmune cytopenias, there is no established evidence-based treatment and steroids are the first-line therapy, with intravenous immunoglobulin administered as a life-saving resource in cases of severe immune thrombocytopenic purpura manifestations. Second-line treatment for refractory ES includes rituximab, mofetil mycophenolate, cyclosporine, vincristine, azathioprine, sirolimus, and thrombopoietin receptor agonists. In cases unresponsive to immunosuppressive agents, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been successful, although it is necessary to consider its potential serious adverse effects [7, 8] . Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) is an infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCOV-2). Although acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cardiac complications, and thromboembolic events have contributed to majority of the disease mortality, it has been suggested that this infection has several hematological abnormalities that develop after or concomitantly to COVID-19 infection [9] and include reduced numbers of peripheral blood lymphocytes (lymphopenia) and eosinophils with an increased polymorphonuclear-to-lymphocyte ratio, autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), Evans syndrome, autoimmune neutropenia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), antiphospholipid syndrome, coagulopathies, including disseminated intravascular coagulation, and increased ferritin and d-dimer levels [10, 11] .",

On physical examination, he had fever (temperature 39 \u00b0C), pallor, jaundice, no enlarged lymph node, chest, and abdominal examination was unremarkable. His oxygen saturation (SpO2) on ambient air was 98%. and his respiratory rate was 19 cycle/min, heart rate 110 beats/min. the following investigations were performed complete blood picture, Hgb 6.1, RBCs 2.23, MCV 85, platelet 185,000, WBCs 10.1, neutrophil 67%, and lymphocytes 26%. Total, direct, and indirect bilirubin (6 mg, 1.8 mg, and 4.2 mg), SGPT 25 \u03bc/l (N up 41 \u03bc/l), Widal test was negative, hepatitis markers, hepatitis A virus (HAV), IgM antibodies, hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV IgG), hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), and total core antibody were negative. Patient was given two blood transfusion and symptomatic treatment. There is no past history of blood transfusion or any bleeding problem or liver disorder in family. He was not on any medication except regularly used oral hypoglycemic drug; after 3 days, 3 May 2021, patient was reevaluated by CBC, which revealed that Hgb \u2193 to 5.9 g/ dl, RBCs \u2193 2.1, platelet 191,000, WBCs \u2191 13.3, neutrophil 72%, and lymphocytes \u2193 20%.

Possibility of hemolytic anemia was suspected. On 5 May 2021, patient was referred to be reevaluated by professor of hemotology and the following investigations were performed: complete blood count showed the following: RBCs 1.58 \u00d7 100 3 /\u03bcl, Hgb 5.4 g/dL, Htc 15.1%, total leukocyte count (WBCs) 8.3 \u00d7 10 3 /\u03bcl, neutrophil 68%, 5.64, lymphocyte relative count % 24%, absolute count 1.99, and platelet count, 117 \u00d7 10 3 /\u03bcl (thrombocytopenia), with severe normocytic normochromic anemia. Peripheral blood smear showed anisopoikilocytosis, tear drop cells rouleaux formation, reticulocytosis and normoblastemia, nucleated red blood cells, and spherocytes. Our patient had reticulocytosis of 12.5% (N 0.5-2.5%), The following were abnormal on laboratory tests: erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR): 1st hour 142 mm (N 3-5 mm), 2nd hour 158 mm (N 7-15 mm), random blood glucose (RBG) 430 mg/dl, serum creatinine 1.2 mg/dl (N 0.9-1.3 mg/dl), blood urea 71 mg/dl (N 10-50 mg/dl), estimated GFR 79 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (N \u02c3 90 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ).

There was increment in bilirubin: total bilirubin 7 mg/dl (0.2-1.0 mg/dl), direct bilirubin 2.4 mg/dl (0.0-0.3 mg/dl), indirect bilirubin 4.6 mg/dl (0.3-0.8 mg/dl), alanine aminotransferase (SGPT) 24 \u03bc/l, N up to 41 \u03bc/l, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 947 U/L (35-460 \u03bc/l). Markers of autoimmune diseases (antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-doublestranded DNA antibodies, ANCAc, ANCAp, and rheumatoid factor) were also negative. In addition, malignant diseases were screened and found to be negative. Chest X-ray (CXR) was within normal limits, and ultrasound of abdomen was normal. Provisional diagnosis of hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia with possibility of COVID-19 infection was made. On May 6 2021, (6 days later) patient develop dyspnea, cough, and progressive fatigue, he was admitted to isolation sector at Sohag General Hospital, and clinical examination revealed yellow discoloration in his eyes, no petechiae, ecchymosis, or rash. His vital signs were as follows: temperature (38 \u00b0C), pulse 112/min, respiratory rate of 25 breaths/min, and O2 saturations on room air was 80%. Chest and abdominal examination was unremarkable. Then, the patient underwent a HRCT chest which demonstrated bilateral small-sized peripheral ground glass opacities in both lungs. (Fig. 1) .

Other authors described the first case series of 3 patients with ITP associated with COVID-19 [23] . Lazarian et al. [10] reported seven cases of warm and cold AIHA associated with COVID-19. These cases occurred during the course of the disease earlier (i.e., a median of 9 days) after admission. However, an indolent B cell malignancy was present in four of them, all required treatment with either steroids or transfusion. Furthermore, another case of AIHA during COVID-19 was reported in a 46-year-old female with a medical history of congenital thrombocytopenia [24] . Several other hematologic disorders have been associated with COVID-19 such as cold agglutinin syndrome, Evans syndrome, or autoimmune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [25, 26] .

[17] reported 4 patients with autoimmune cytopenias (AIC) (2 autoimmune hemolytic anemias, AIHA, 1 Evans syndrome, and 1 immune thrombocytopenia) with COVID-19 pneumonia. Most of COVID-related cytopenias described in literature developed at the time of COVID-19 infection (generally within the first month). It is largely known that autoimmune cytopenias may be triggered by viral and bacterial infections, due to mechanisms of molecular mimicry, hidden epitope spreading and neo-antigen generation [2, 28] . Interestingly, the RBC membrane protein ankyrin-1 was found to share a 100% identity with the SARS-CoV-2 surface glycoprotein spike [27] , suggesting a molecular mimicry mechanism for AIHA. Regarding ITP, anti-GP IIb/IIIa, GP-Ib/IX, or GP-V antibodies have been identified in several cases [29] , although a sequence homology between platelet components and SARS-CoV-2 still needs to be documented. Furthermore, during infections, platelets and viruses interact in a sialic acid-dependent manner, leading to increased hepatic clearance of platelets. Sialic acids may act as additional receptors for SARS-COV-2 spike protein, possibly accounting for thrombocytopenia in COVID-19, as observed for influenza virus [30, 31] . Finally, AIC secondary to infections are thought to be often transient and/or promptly responsive to first-line therapy.",
