The patients required mechanical ventilation for 9 days in one and 28 days in the other. In both cases, the patients were discharged but later developed symptoms of cough and dyspnea, which were later diagnosed as PILS. Persistent cough and dyspnea are common symptoms in both PILS and the recovery phase of severe COVID-19. For this reason, PILS should be considered in the differential diagnosis post-COVID-19 patients. In addition, the prevalence of PILS may be greater than that of other critical diseases in severe COVID-19 patients.",

In a small fraction of patients, COVID-19 results in severe illness compounded by serious complications, including severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, sepsis, septic shock or multiple organ failure and even death (5) . COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive-care unit (ICU) often require prolonged mechanical ventilation with high positive end-expiratory pressure through an endotracheal tube (6) . Patients with prolonged ventilation may require a tracheostomy to optimize weaning from ventilatory support (7) . A recent comprehensive review of a database including 109 ICUs found that tracheostomy placement occurred at a median of 9 (interquartile range, 5-14) days after ICU admission (8) . However, the global trend observed for COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU is an undeniable procrastination of tracheostomy when feasible (6). One reason for this delay is consideration of the risk of cross-infection among healthcare professionals.",

The risk factors of PILS were prolonged intubation, endotracheal tube material, over-inflation of the tracheal cuff, trauma induced during intubation, tube displacement after intubation and endotracheal tube size (1, 14, 15) . In another previous report, orotracheal intubation in excess of 10 days prior to tracheostomy was associated with increased rates of PILS (16) . Regardless of the fact that we used a standard cuff pressure and appropriate tube sizes, we experienced two cases of PILS in patients who recently underwent mechanical ventilation due to COVID-19 in a relatively short period of time. PILS is a rarely encountered condition, and its incidence is estimated to be 4.9 cases per million per year (3). Our facility experienced 20 patients with severe COVID-19 who required mechanical ventilation in the ICU from March to June 2020. Although the exact prevalence of PILS after acute COVID-19 is unknown, 2 out of 20 patients developed PILS at our facility.",

However, in COVID-19 patients, long-term intubation and a persistent cough may cause laryngotracheal mucosal damage and inflammation, leading to tracheal stenosis. Furthermore, obesity was associated with increased rates of developing post-intubation tracheal stenosis (17) . The most common and frequently reported symptoms of COVID-19 are a fever (88-98%) and cough (59-68%) (17, 18) . A strong and persistent cough, in addition to increased inspiratory effort, may pose an inherent risk for developing PILS after prolonged intubation. It should be noted that the clinical manifestations of PILS closely resemble those of severe COVID-19 in the recovery phase.",
