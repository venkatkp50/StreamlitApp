            "text": "Electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) are a diverse class of tobacco products that aerosolize a nicotine-containing liquid that is directly inhaled by the user. E-cig devices are available in many variations and they have rapidly evolved over time. The first e-cig devices were simple, small devices shaped like a combustible cigarette (cigalikes) that housed the nicotine-containing liquid in cartridges. Advances in technology lead to more complex, larger pen and box-shaped devices that utilized refillable tanks, or reservoirs, to house the nicotine liquid (advanced/mods) [1] . The most recent evolution of e-cigs, which are referred to as pod-mods, are small, discrete devices that utilize interchangeable pods to house the nicotine-containing liquid, typically in a salt form, which is less harsh [2] . These devices have a sleek design, user-friendly functionality, and an array of flavor options [3] . They are also known to deliver nicotine in doses that are higher than many earlier devices [4] [5] [6] . This type of device was made popular by the market leader called JUUL [7] . In 2018, 14 .9% of adults in the United States reported ever using an e-cig, and 3.2% reported current use [8] . Many adults report initiating e-cig use as a way to quit cigarette smoking [9, 10] ; however, the impact of e-cig use on quitting smoking has been controversial in the literature [11] [12] [13] . Some studies have reported that e-cig use is not associated with increased success in quitting [14, 15] , while other studies have found that e-cigs can be effective aids in quitting [16] [17] [18] . A recent, large randomized controlled trial that was conducted in the United Kingdom found that those using e-cigs were almost twice as likely to remain abstinent from cigarettes at one year, when compared with those using nicotine replacement therapy [17] . Of importance, studies have reported that flavored products are used by the majority of adult users [19] [20] [21] , and could be associated with a successful transition from cigarettes to e-cigs [22] [23] [24] [25] .",

In 2020, 19 .6% of high school students and 4.7% of middle school students in the United States reported using an e-cig in the past 30 days, which makes e-cigs the most widely used tobacco product in this age group [26] . Most youth e-cig users report using pod-based products [26, 27] , like JUUL, which are capable of delivering nicotine in high doses that are similar to a cigarette [5, 6] . In addition, the majority of youth e-cig users reported initiating e-cig use because of the appealing flavor options [28] . One study reported that 77.9% of adolescent and 90.3% of young adult users in the United States reported appealing flavors as a reason for e-cig use [28] . Together, these findings suggest that flavored products available with devices that are capable of delivering large amounts of nicotine may be driving youth e-cig use.",

First, JUUL Labs Inc. voluntarily removed mango, cr\u00e8me, fruit, and cucumber flavored products from retail stores in November 2018 and later online in October 2019. Soon after, in November 2019, JUUL also completely removed mint flavored products from the market [29] . These steps were taken in response to criticism that JUUL received for their marketing practices, which were seen to promote youth use through the use of young models, brightly colored designs, multitude of flavored products, and use of the social media platform for promotions [7] . Most recently (February 2020), the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned the sale of all flavored cartridge/pod-based products. This ban included \"any small, enclosed unit (sealed or unsealed) designed to fit within or operate as part of an ENDS product\". Of importance, the ban did not include tobacco or menthol flavored pod-based products or flavored liquid products that were used in tank-based devices or flavored disposable products [27] . Although similar, mint was distinguished from menthol, because it is not a traditional cigarette flavor and it was popular among youth [30] .",

First, the samples of current adult JUUL users were surveyed at varying time points (before and after the FDA flavor ban) in order to measure changes in the proportion of users reporting the use of flavored pods. In addition, this study also aimed to explore use behaviors that could result from the changes in flavored pod availability.

Transcripts were then reviewed while using the constant comparative method [38] and the codebook was refined through comparison and discussion. Next, each researcher coded the same four transcripts (25% of the data) while using the finalized codebook and inter-rater reliability (IRR) was calculated between the researchers (J.M.Y and C.R.B.) with a reliability standard of k > 0.8 in order to ensure consistency in coding. All of the data presented in this study were coded into the theme, FDA flavor ban. Sub-themes for the FDA flavor ban theme included no impact, switching to other available pods, switching to other available products, and continuing use of flavored pod-based products illicitly.",

Another participant noted that they use the available JUUL pod, but treat themselves with flavored disposable products. They said, \"When I feel like I want to reward myself, I tell myself that I'll get like a flavored Puff Bar, something like that. But they're a little bit more expensive\" (male, age 23, 3 CPD). Another participant reported the use of generic flavored pods. They said, \"It has completely changed my buying habits. I always a hundred percent of the time, if it's available, choose a generic that has a better flavor over the actual JUUL pod\" (female, age 28, 10 CPD). These participants expressed confusion over differences in which flavored products were allowed to be sold. These participants said, \"I'm kind of confused on what happened with that situation. Like, how come other vape companies can use like different flavors but JUUL can't\" (male, age 23, 3 CPD) and \"So that just makes no sense to me.

Prior to JUUL removing their flavored products from the market, mint was the most popular flavored pod, being used by more than 43% of users. Following the FDA ban, the data from the three time-points showed a significant decrease in the use of mint pods and a significant increase in the use of menthol pods, which makes it the most popular flavored pod (34.8%). These findings were consistent with the within-subject data that were collected from participants at time-point 3. In addition, the findings from our small study were also supported by retail market data, which showed a dramatic increase in menthol flavored cartridge/pod-based product sales following JUUL's removal of mint flavored pods from the market [29, 40] . One study reported that, by May 2020, menthol dominated the market, with 61.8% of prefilled cartridge/pod-based sales [29] . Many participants perceived that the shift from mint, a flavor removed from the market, to menthol, an available flavor, was easy, because both products contained nicotine, the real driver behind their continued use. This is an important finding, because it suggests the willingness of users to switch to the flavors that are available [40] .",

This same pattern was also found in a study that evaluated flavor use after the ban of flavored products in San Francisco [41] . This suggests that users are still able to access banned flavored pods in some way, especially since the retail data suggest that users are not purchasing these products in stores [29] . First, it is possible that users stockpiled JUUL pods in anticipation of the ban, as indicated in the qualitative data, and they were still using pods from their own supply at the time of the survey. Additionally, it is possible that users were able to purchase JUUL pods from stores who continued to sell them illegally or obtain pods from other countries that are able to legally sell JUUL flavored pods. In addition, it is also possible that users could have purchased counterfeit pods that are marketed as JUUL [42] . Finally, it is possible that users misinterpreted the question and instead of reporting use of JUUL brand pods, they were reporting the flavor of generic or refilled JUUL-compatible pods. It will be important for future studies to evaluate how users are able to access the banned flavors.",

            "text": "We found a slight increase in the number of users reporting generic pods use from S1 to S3, with approximately 12% of users reporting the use of generic brand flavored cartridge/pod-based products after the FDA ban. This upward trend in generic pod use could be due to a lack of compliance with the FDA regulations by the companies that produce these generic products. While companies not in compliance risk enforcement action by the FDA [27] , enforcement could be delayed due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving these products to remain on the market. This shift from brand name products, like JUUL, with known quality control methods to generic products is concerning. Recently, there was an outbreak of a serious lung illness, called EVALI (e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury), which was later identified as being caused by black market THC cartridges that contained Vitamin E acetate [43, 44] . While EVALI was not linked with the use of nicotine e-cig pods, it is possible that a similar outbreak could occur among nicotine e-cig users if the use of generic products or illicit products continues outside of quality controls that are required for FDA Premarket Tobacco Product Application (or PMTA) approval.",

            "text": "In addition, we found a significant difference over time in the proportion of users who reported refilling their single-use JUUL pods, a behavior that is warned against for safety and quality reasons [45] . This involves purchasing an e-cig liquid that is not intended for use in JUUL products and adding that liquid to a JUUL pod. JUUL pods are designed for one-time use, so this is not easy, but consumers can find instructional videos and posts online. Our data showed that, when flavored JUUL pods were no longer on the market, there was an increase in refilling. Subsequently, with the FDA ban, there was a sharp decrease in reported refilling. This decrease in refilling could be attributed to participants learning to find other sources of flavored products, such as purchasing generic brand flavored pods, reducing the need to refill their JUUL pods with the flavors that they like. It is also possible that users switched to other flavored product types. While flavored cartridge/pod-based products were banned by the FDA, flavored disposable e-cig products were not. A recent study examining retail data showed an increase in the use of mint flavored disposable products from 2017 to 2020 [29] , and the National Youth Tobacco Survey reported a 1000% increase in the use of disposable products from 2019 to 2020 [26] . In addition, a study of internet searches reported a sharp increase of searches pertaining to disposable products, like Puff Bar [26, 46] . Switching to products that are available with flavors was discussed by participants during the qualitative interviews, and many perceived the differences in what flavored products could and could not be sold to be confusing. This loophole in regulation is particularly concerning for youth populations who may still have access to flavored products. The current study was not able to assess whether the FDA ban on flavored products led adult users to return to cigarette smoking. Future longitudinal studies are needed in order to further evaluate the impact of flavored product bans on returning to smoking. Other limitations include the use of a small convenience sample for the quantitative portion of the study. We conducted post-hoc power analysis to address this limitation, and determined that the study had sufficient power to detect small to medium effects (phi \u2265 0.2), while it was under powered for detecting small effects sizes (phi < 0.2). Given the effect sizes that were found for our chi-square analyses assessing change in flavor proportion across the three time-points, we had sufficient power to detect small to medium effects in comparisons of mint, menthol, and mango (phi \u2265 0.2, estimated power \u2265 87%) and the study was underpowered to detect small effects in classic tobacco, Virginia tobacco, fruit, cr\u00e8me, and cucumber (phi < 0.2, estimated power < 45%). Future research with larger sample sizes will help to elucidate the more nuanced effects that regulations and market changes might have on flavor use over time.",

The MTurk participants are not representative of the general population; therefore, we are not able to make any population-based inferences that are based on these results [47] . However, MTurk is an ideal platform to recruit JUUL users, since those completing tasks tend to be younger, with an over-representation of substance users [33, 48] . In addition, this study focused on adult JUUL users. This was due to the age restrictions of the MTurk platform, which only allows for those 18 and older to have an account. Because the youth population is of interest, we completed a sub-subsample analysis to compare the impacts on young adults to the entire sample. These results were similar, which suggested that young adult and adult users respond similarly to flavor restrictions. Future studies are needed to evaluate the impact of these restrictions among a youth and young adult population.",
