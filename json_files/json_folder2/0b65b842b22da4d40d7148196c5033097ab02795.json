However, poor face-fit is almost universally present in pleated multilayer disposable face masks, severely limiting both individual and community respiratory protection. We developed a set of simple mask modifications to mass-manufactured disposable masks, the most common type of mask used by the public, that dramatically improves both their personalized fit and performance in a low-cost and scalable manner. These modifications comprise a user-moldable full mask periphery wire, integrated earloop tension adjusters, and an inner flange to trap respiratory droplets. We demonstrate that these simple design changes improves quantitative fit factor by 320%, triples the level of protection against aerosolized droplets, and approaches the model efficacy .

SARS-CoV-2 is known to spread via respiratory droplets and aerosols asymptomatically and pre-symptomatically (1). In the absence of cure or vaccination, numerous nonpharmaceutical public health interventions such as travel restrictions, mass screening, quarantine centers, and contact tracing have been implemented to control the pandemic (2). Even after successful vaccination, masks can be protective while resistance develops, prevent potential asymptomatic spread, and provide protection for immunocompromised individuals and in communities where vaccination has been limited. (3) As a low-risk, precautionary control method (4), universal face masking has shown effectiveness in reducing disease spread (5). However, the performance of most cloth and disposable 3-ply, 3-pleat disposable masks (3PM) is degraded by poor face fit, resulting in leakage of aerosols at gaps between the mask and a wearer's face. This leakage reduces the quantifiable 'fit factor', a metric of mask fit performance. Conventional 3PM have fit factors (FFs) of only 2.6 -4.4 (6, 7), equivalent to ca. 20 -40% leakage. A further limitation of conventional disposable masks occurs during coughing and sneezing, which elevate the mask, enlarging peripheral gaps. To this effect, disposable masks work least well when source control is the most required.",

Due to large variability in the performance of commercially available consumer masks, the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) released new standards from masks designed provide community and workplace protection against the spread of airborne contagion (12,13). A central feature of these new standards is their requirements for fit, breathability, and filtration.",

Each design element was specifically considered for its ability to be incorporated into current automated mass manufacturing systems with minimal modification and cost.

With the moldable element, the mask gains a pliable structure that can conform to any face, with minimal gaps. Compared to the conventionally used 100 mm-long nose bridge wire, a longer and thicker nose wire (length > 120mm, diameter > 0.58mm) provides a better seal across the entire nasal-infraorbital region (bizygomatic breadth). The wires on the cheek and the chin edges of the mask provide a fitting experience similar to cup-shaped respirators and enable customized shaping of the mask edge. Pinching the side or chin wires reduces the effective length of the sides which tightens the fit and further reduces gaps (Fig. S1) , and as such, these face-conformal adjustments improve fit, particularly for users with smaller faces.",

Vapor escaping through open gaps for the 3PM was visible near the forehead, while vapor release through the side of the mask was clearly visible as a gray plume near the ears ( Fig. 2A, red arrow) . Qualitative assessment of UFM vapor unequivocally demonstrated less vapor escape, with more vapor instead being forced through the mask filter material ( Fig. 2A, yellow arrow) . These observations were confirmed by plotting relative laser scattering (RLS) of every frame of the acquired videos over time (Fig. 2B,D) . Leaked vapor from the UFM at the nasal-infraorbital side was nearly an order of magnitude less for the first 1.5 seconds than that with the 3PM (Fig. 2B ). After 1.5 seconds, a higher RLS with the UFM was observed, corresponding to scattering of floating vapor that penetrated the mask filter material earlier (Movie S2). The UFM demonstrated negligible cheek leakage, with only a small leak plume arising from the chin region (Fig. 2C, yellow arrow) . With the UFM, the amount of laser scattering from around the cheeks due to leakage was reduced by ca. two orders of magnitude.",

Synchronous thermal changes at the mask surface with breathing cycles were visible as relatively cool inhaled air and relatively warm exhaled breath pass through the mask filter material. Inward and outward leakage along the nose-infraorbital edge of the mask were visualized as zones of high thermal variation over time (Fig. 3A) . The ingress of cool air through the nasal-infraorbital edge of the mask at the end of inhalation and egress of warm breath at the end of exhalation indicated leakage for the 3PM. For the UFM, the nasal-infraorbital edge remained relatively warm during breathing cycles except for a small ingress on the right side of the wearer (Fig. 3A) . Over a 2-minute breathing cycle, the UFM showed larger temperature variation in the center of the mask consistent with cycling of cool inhaled air and warm exhaled air traversing the mask filter material (Fig. 3B ) Thermal variation analysis at the right and left sides of the nasal-infraorbital edge of both masks showed that a sinusoidal response in the UFM was less pronounced. A higher offset temperature around the edge of the UFM was due to increased skin contact owing to the reduction in mask edge gaps (Fig. 3C) . Overall, thermal imaging demonstrated that the UFM directed air through the filter material and removed ingress and egress air leaks around the mask edge.",

Exposure to aerosol droplets without any protection resulted in coverage of 77 \u00b1 7 % of the mannequin surface (Fig. 4B) , and 3PM masks reduced the dye-covered area by 22%, (Fig. 4B ) (P < 0.05). Dye accumulation was observed in the same zones of poor fit identified during thermal imaging. This observation demonstrates that these areas of poor fit provide an opportunity for dangerous aerosols to bypass the mask filter material. The UFM was three times more effective at reducing aerosol ingress compared to the 3PM (Fig. 4C ) (P < 0.0001), even though the hard plastic of the mannequin reduced the ability of the UFM to form the tight seal normally generated as the mask is pulled against compliant skin by the adjustable tethering device.",

The average UFM fit factor (FF) was 12.9 \u00b1 7.2 ( Fig 5A) , which was 320% of the 3PM FF (FF = 4.0 \u00b1 1.8, P < 0.001) and 240% of the KF94 mask FF (FF = 5.5 \u00b1 5.9, P < 0.001) respectively, while the observed difference between the 3PM and KF94 mask FFs was not statistically significant (P > 0.9999) (Fig. 5A ). During the 'Bending Over' exercise, all three masks had a lower FF, and the UFM FF did not show a significant improvement compared to the other two masks (Fig. 5D , P > 0.05). Bending-over involved moving the upper body while a hose was connected to the mask during the test. Facial leakage was introduced due to the large body motion and strain created by the experimental setup in this position. Three experienced UFM users, whom as test users didn't require donning instructions, scored an average overall FF of 23.7 \u00b1 5.5 (P < 0.001) whereas novice UFM users scored an average overall FF of 4.7 \u00b1 2.5, suggesting further face fit improvement with experience ( Fig. 5C ). Interestingly, in novice users the UFM FF was 2.5 times higher than the 3PM FF (P < 0.005), consistent with a marked improvement in performance, even in novice users. While, in our user group, the presence of facial hair reduced fit factors, which was consistent with literature values (Fig. 5D ), the UFM FF was still significantly higher compared to 3PM FF for users, both with and without facial hair (P < 0.001 and P < 0.0001, respectively).",

(17) Masking was beneficial in the model no matter the quality of the mask, but as fit and filtration efficiency increased the amount of protection increased (Fig. 8A) . At with 50% of the class using masks the cloth mask, 3PM, excellent cloth mask, UFM, and N95 respirator reduced the relative risk of airborne infection by 18%, 24%, 44%, 62%, and 73% compared to no masks being used, respectively (Fig. 8A) . We calculated the relative impact of each mask type on the airborne infection risk parameter, a predictive measure of the rate an individual is exposed to an infectious agent, for a subway car. We found similarly that the UFM out performed both model cloth masks and the 3PM (Fig. 8B ). At 50% mask prevalence the UFM use dropped the airborne infection risk by 50.4% compared to the 3PM. In both model situations, the UFM approached the efficacy of N95 respirators to prevent the community spread of COVID-19.",

Each design element of the UFM was intentionally developed with a focus on manufacturability and scalability to enable the UFM to be produced on existing automated production lines with simple modifications to close peripheral gaps. As a result, large numbers of UFM can be produced at scale without the need for complex and expensive retooling. The UFM is a low-cost, massproducible, easy-to-don, and comfortable face mask that minimizes face seal leakage by i) adding pliability to mask periphery to enable face molding to create a personalized facial fit, ii) integrating ear loop tension adjustment facilitating optimal compression of the mask on the wearer's face, and iii) an inner \"cough-trap\" flap for blocking rapid respiratory jets induced by coughing or sneezing. With these three innovations, the performance of the UFM exceeds ASTM F3502 Level 2 Barrier Face Covering specifications and achieves the NIOSH criteria for a Workplace Performance Plus mask. While the quantitative fit experimental protocols implemented in the present study represent industry standards for evaluating face mask-fit performance (20), we performed additional experiments using thermal imaging, laser particle scattering, thermal imaging, and fluorescent photography visually to illustrate the ability of the UFM to prevent the expulsion and ingress of aerosols.",

However, additional work is required to evaluate how users may be able to repeatedly sanitize the UFM for multiple use cycles. Compliance, as with all behavioral modifications, is a complex multifactorial challenge that extends beyond the properties of any individual mask. Additionally, the ability to reuse masks can dramatically reduce waste and environmental burden generated by mask mandates (31) .

The tight fit of N95 masks creates discomfort and pressure injuries with extended and repeated use particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic (9) . A survey of 4,306 clinicians in China during February 2020 found that 42.8% had experienced skin injuries due to their personal protective equipment (10) . Respiratory protection provided by the N95 respirators come at the price of a compliant user-seal check and either qualitative or quantitative. Qualitative fit test based on human taste sensory is a realistic fit test program at healthcare providers. If no fit test was performed, the N95's protection, due to inadequate face seal, is significantly reduced, and N95 respirators frequently need to be readjusted as 10-70% of initial tests fail to meet required levels depending upon the mask model and institution. (21) Also, access to N95 respirators was very limited to the public during the pandemic, due to the needs of healthcare personnel operating in high risk environments. These issues with N95 respirators, are part of the reason why even after shortages have somewhat resolved they still lack adoption in the broader community in low risk settings and would be difficult to rapidly deploy for use by the general population. The value comparison of the Ultra Fit mask, the N95 respirator and alternative devices (Table S1) shows that the UFM can be the best public respiratory protection. In models of community spread, the UFM approached the same level of protection as N95 masks to prevent the spread of airborne disease on a community basis. However, in an individual context, a fit-tested N95 still offers superior protection for use in aerosol-generating environments, and this protection exceeds the risks of discomfort and skin injury (9).",

The number of individuals in the classroom and subway car were set to 20 and 35, respectively, and there was assumed to be one infective individual in each case. Data in the classroom was normalized against the risk of a secondary infection occurring in the absence of any masks over a 50 minute class period.

This 3PM is compliant with GB/T32610-2016. However, any rectangularly-shaped pleated face mask and medical-use surgical mask can be used as a base mask. Segments of Zinc-galvanized steel wires with a diameter of 0.023\" (8872K16, McMaster-Carr) were hot-melt glued on the four edges on the rear side of the base mask, which were then taped over with medical tapes for soft contact with the skin (Micropore TM , 3M, MedFix, Medline). Empiric experimentation across a range of different wire diameters demonstrated the best performance with 0.50mm to 0.58mm bare wire. The material of the internal flap was the same material as the inner base mask layer, spunbond polypropylene nonwoven fabric with a weight of 30 -40 grams per sq. meter. Custom-designed tethering adjusting components were cut from a stock polypropylene sheet (ITW Formex-GK17) and bonded with hot-melt glue on the upper corners on the front side of the base mask.
