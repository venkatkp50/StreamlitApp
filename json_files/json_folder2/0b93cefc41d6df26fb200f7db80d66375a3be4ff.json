In COVID-19, initial reports of the utility of PCT were from hospitalised patients where PCT was found to correlate with disease severity, longer intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and inpatient mortality, along with a range of other biochemical markers (4) (5) (6) . However, PCT would have unique value if its measurement at admission for COVID-19 illness or at time of clinical deterioration could be an important discriminator between bacterial co-infection versus noninfectious cause, allowing for improved AMS (7), as there is widespread use of empiric antibiotics globally in hospitalised patients with COVID-19, despite low rates of microbiologically proven bacterial infection (1, 2) .",
