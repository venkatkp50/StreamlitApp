Sceptics felt manufacturers hadn't given enough proof of the safety of the vaccine and lacked confidence in government's assessment of the epidemiological situation. The COVID 19 pandemic, fear of infertility and the negative influence of social media were perceived as the main reasons for community hesitancy.

The 2020-2024 National Strategic Plan for Prevention and Cancer Control has a specific objective two that aims to increase primary prevention interventions by 25%, through communication for behaviour change in favour of cancer control. One of the priority interventions to achieve this objective is immunisation with the HPV vaccine. Several demonstration projects carried out in the country between 2010 and 2016 targeting 9-to 13-year-old girls revealed a high acceptability of the vaccine (12) and the NIP's capacity to accommodate the vaccine. Thus, with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance's support, the HPV vaccine was scheduled to be introduced into the NIP in November 2020. The objective was to fully vaccinate 70% of 9-year-old girls by 2021 using the school and fixed strategies. Pre-introductory activities included microplanning, capacity building of stakeholders, vaccine procurement and community sensitisation.",

The microplanning from the workshop brought about the enumeration of 1,003 girls aged 9 years fully registered in 61 primary schools in the district. Vaccination was scheduled to take place during the week of the 23 rd of November 2021. That same month, a capacity building workshop for providers was organised. Out of 27 vaccinators invited, only 15 participated in the training. Therefore, health area chiefs were tasked with capacitating all vaccinators in their zone who didn't attend the training. Quadrivalent Gardasil was the vaccine to be administered in two doses with a 6-month interval between doses. Each vial contained a single dose of the vaccine. Based on the estimated number of 9-year-old girls in the district, 940 doses of the vaccine were allocated to the district to be supplied as need be. The first batch of vaccines were transported from the regional cold chain to the district cold chain 1 month prior to vaccine introduction. Due to the lack of electricity in the health district, all vaccines were stored in the district cold chain and only supplied to vaccination centres on vaccination days. Communication material were also distributed to the various vaccination centres.",

Faced with these, vaccinators were instructed to reschedule vaccination dates in each school and ensure teachers sent written consent forms to parents. CHWs were instructed to continue community sensitisation. Despite these measures, only 43 girls were vaccinated between January to March 2021 using both the school and fixed strategy. A similar trend was observed at regional level whereby only 294 out of 50,840 girls had been vaccinated between January and March 2021 thus making the Centre region the second least performing region in Cameroon. On the other hand, the Southwest region which is characterised by socio-political crisis and displaced populations was ranked the best performing region with 3,024 out of 18,525 girls receiving their first dose of the vaccine during the same period.",

Similarly, another capacity building workshop on HPV vaccination was carried out for all vaccinators in the district. Despite the workshop, no orders were placed for the vaccine by vaccinators at the district cold chain. Faced with this situation, we therefore sought to evaluate vaccinators' perception of HPV vaccination in order to design and improve strategies to increase uptake of the HPV vaccine in the district.

In some cases, it may affect marital life, lead to promiscuity, exposure to sexually transmitted infections and psychological trauma especially for women (22) . This fear of infertility has been reported to affect reproductive health (RH) decision making practises among populations (23) . They abstain from vital reproductive health services such as family planning, screening and vaccination. In our setting this fear of infertility was also expressed by vaccinators and can be considered a major factor to HPV vaccine hesitancy. More efforts in proximity as well as mass sensitisation on the role RH services play in improving fertility are needed to improve uptake of RH services such as HPV vaccination. This sensitisation will also help dissipate rumours which are being spread on social media. The affordability of android phones and the availability of the internet even in remote villages has facilitated access to social media. Unfortunately, most people are not able to philtre true from fake news and are prone to believe rumours which tend to be more sensational than the truth.",

However, the health district service considered this as a major cause of hesitancy as access into Catholic schools for vaccination was denied nor were HPV vaccination schedules announced in Catholic churches. Religious leaders have been reported to influence the health behaviour of their congregants both on a personal and community level (24) . This key role is used as a tool for health promotion in communities (25) . Despite this influence, the final decision rests with parents and some parents use religion as a reason not to have their children vaccinated (26) . In 2017 the Pontifical Academy for Life stated that all clinically recommended vaccines could be used with a clear conscience (27) therefore, continuous advocacy with local Catholic church leaders on the safety and necessity of the HPV vaccine is needed since they greatly influence the health behaviour of the population.",

            "text": "Health providers' trust in the health system is likely to shape their recommendation practises. A considerable number of vaccinators in our setting mistrusted health authorities and pharmaceutical companies thus rendering them sceptical about the HPV vaccine. Vaccinators are less likely to recommend HPV vaccination if they do not see its necessity nor alleviate parents' worries about the vaccine (28) . These directly affect HPV vaccination services provision and uptake. Reasons given for the general state of mistrust of health workers in Cameroon toward the state include poor working conditions, low salaries, pressure from hierarchy to perform, poor communication among others (20, 29) . In Cameroon communication during health campaigns is carried out at all levels of the health pyramid. The central level engages mass media while the district level handle proximity sensitisation (30, 31) . For the introduction of the HPV vaccine, vaccinators felt the central level didn't adequately play its part in sensitising the population via mass media thereby rendering proximity sensitisation very tough. However, it has been shown that in rural areas during vaccination campaigns, a majority of the population is sensitised through proximity sensitisation as opposed to mass media (32, 33) . Generally, the district performs well in routine and supplementary immunisation activities. The district registered a BCG vaccination coverage of 81.2%, a DTP3 coverage of 83.6% and a specific dropout rate of 7.9 % in 2020. Similarly, a measles rubella campaign in 2019 pre introduction of the second dose of the measles rubella vaccine into the EPI registered a coverage of 98% among children aged 12 to 59 months. Also, the district registered a coverage of 96.6% in 2021 during the polio SIA targeting children 0-59 months which was carried out during the COVID pandemic. In contrast the HPV vaccine had only registered a coverage of 5.4% seven months post introduction. Vaccinators need to acknowledge the essential role they play in sensitising parents about the HPV vaccine and creating an enabling environment for vaccine uptake. Nonetheless, the state still needs to play its role in communicating adequately about the HPV vaccine especially in the COVID 19 context where a lot of financial and human resources have been diverted from other health programs to fight against the pandemic.",
