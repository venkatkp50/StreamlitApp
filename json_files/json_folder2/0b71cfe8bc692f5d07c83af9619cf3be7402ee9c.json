The lockdown in response to COVID-19 may have resulted in lifestyle changes that affected sleep quality. For this reason, the objective of this study is to determine the difference in nursing students' sleep quality before and during the lockdown, put in place in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. To meet this objective, we conducted a longitudinal observational study on 207 nursing students, with two cut-off points (February and April). The main dependent variable was sleep quality, measured using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) and its seven components. Parametric and nonparametric tests were used for paired and unpaired data, as well as group-stratified analysis. The mean time students spent in bed was 7.6 h (standard deviation (SD) = 1.1 h) before lockdown and 8.5 h (SD = 1.2 h) during lockdown. The PSQI score got 0.91 points worse during lockdown (95% CI, \u22120.51, \u22121.31). Of the five components, five were statistically significantly affected (p \u2264 0.05), and of these, the most changed were sleep latency, sleep duration, and sleep efficiency. When stratified by group, we observed differences in women, first-year students, second-year students, alcohol consumers, those of normal weight, and those that live with family.

This could also be the case for nursing students. Also, the fact that students in earlier years of study experienced significantly worse sleep quality during lockdown suggests that the same reasoning applies; students in their final years of study had their placements canceled, while students in their first years of study had to adapt to a new way of teaching and virtual assessments in order to pass the year, which could have increased stress and worsened sleep quality.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 529, "end": 533, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Another interesting aspect was the place of residence during the academic year.
