A greater understanding of how the virus interacts with the host can contribute to more realistic epidemiological models and help evaluate the effect of antiviral therapies and vaccines. Here, we present a within-host model to describe SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics in the upper respiratory tract of individuals enrolled in the UK COVID-19 Human Challenge Study. Using this model, we investigate the viral dynamics and provide timescales of infection that independently verify key epidemiological parameters important in the management of an epidemic. In particular, we estimate that an infected individual is first capable of transmitting the virus after approximately 2.1 days, remains infectious for a further 8.",

Mathematical modelling has been used throughout the pandemic to predict numbers of cases, hospitalisations and deaths, as well as the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions [1, 2, 3] . In these epidemiological models, the rate at which susceptible individuals become infected can be thought of as the product of a contact rate and a transmission probability. The contact rate is simply interpreted as the number of contacts an individual makes per unit time, with insights provided from social contact studies [4, 5] . The probability of transmission, however, is not as well-defined and depends on many factors such as the environment in which the contact takes place, the duration of the contact and the infectiousness of the individual. Intuitively, an individual is most infectious when viral loads in their respiratory tract peak [6, 7] , therefore understanding how viral loads change over time is crucial to understanding infectiousness. Within-host models can be used to describe how interactions between virus particles, host cells and the immune system affect the viral load over time, with the link to infectiousness then provided by either dose-response relationships or the assumption that the transmission probability is an increasing function of viral load [8, 9] .",

In some cases, these models are extended to include compartments such as the lower respiratory tract (LRT), however, observing LRT infection is difficult and is unlikely to play a 1 role in person-to-person transmission [13] . Often, swab data are presented in the form of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cycle threshold values (Ct values) that are converted into RNA copies by means of a standard curve. However, since a PCR test captures all genetic material, it quantifies the total viral RNA and not the amount of viable virus that is capable of infecting cells [14] . This therefore makes it difficult for models parameterised using such data to predict the duration that an individual remains infectious; a previous study has shown that live virus cannot be isolated from respiratory samples 8-9 days after symptom onset notwithstanding persistently high viral RNA loads [15] . Despite this, some models have directly estimated the infectiousness of an individual from predictions of total viral load [16, 17] , whilst others have first linked total and infectious viral loads using the probability that a sample is culture positive [18] .",

The majority of models account for this by assuming a fixed incubation period of between 3 and 7 days, however, since symptom onset approximately coincides with peak viral loads, the models can only reliably predict the decay in viral loads and not the initial growth [19] . Human challenge studies allow us to study the processes of infection and immunity from their inception and therefore provide a complete overview of the disease course [20] . Screening of participants can also ensure that samples are representative of primary infection, whilst a quarantine setting allows data to be obtained with a level of detail not achievable in a real-life setting [21] .",

In this model, target cells (T ) become infected with infectious virus (V inf ) at rate \u03b2 and enter a non-productive eclipse phase (E) for 1/k days, after which they enter a productively infectious phase lasting for a further 1/\u03b4 days. Whilst cells are in the infectious phase, they produce infectious virus at rate p inf which in turn loses infectivity at rate c inf . Viral RNA is produced by an infectious cell at rate p tot and lose viability with rate c tot . To represent an adaptive immune response, we note that effector cell responses (C), such as those of CD8 + T cells, go through an antigen-dependent activation stage, followed by a virus-independent expansion phase. The growth rate of the effector cell population is therefore initially dependent on the total viral load (V tot ), but once this becomes large enough, exponential growth of the effector cell population follows [25] . Effector cells help to resolve infection through the mass action killing of infected cells with rate k C and survive for an average of 1/\u03b4 C days. The model is described by the system of ordinary differential equations:",

This method is an extension of the original ABC algorithm and uses a sequence of decreasing tolerances to obtain intermediate distributions that ultimately converge on the target posterior distribution. Parameter sets are sampled from the intermediate distribution of the previous generation and perturbed using a multivariate normal kernel, the covariance matrix of which is selected here to be the optimal local covariance matrix introduced in [28] . Choosing a suitable sequence of tolerances is important since tolerances that decrease too slowly will result in slower convergence, whilst a sequence that decreases too quickly will lead to lower acceptance rates. To avoid manually setting the tolerances beforehand, an adaptive approach is implemented where the tolerance for the current generation is equal to the 0.25 quantile of the distances from the previous generation [26] . For the first generation, the tolerance is equal to the N th smallest distance from 5N iterations of an ABC rejection sampling algorithm, where N = 5 \u00d7 10 3 is the desired sample size [29] .",

In this study, 36 healthy, young participants were inoculated intranasally with a wild-type SARS-CoV-2 virus following a screening process that ruled out previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and recent respiratory infections. Two of these participants seroconverted between screening and inoculation and were removed from the study. Of the 34 individuals that continued in the study, 18 developed an infection. Six of these individuals were treated with remdesivir once two consecutive nose or throat swabs showed quantifiable SARS-CoV-2 detection by PCR, however, their viral loads were comparable to those of untreated participants and therefore no distinction was made between the treated and untreated participants in previous analyses [31] . Here, we continue to analyse the treated and untreated participants as a single cohort. Due to concentrations of viral RNA in the mid-turbinate remaining below the limit of quantification until day 6 and day 8, a further two participants are excluded since the model is not able to explain such long delays before viral growth. Although both nasal and throat swabs were collected, only measurements from the nasal swabs are used to parameterise our model. The Bayesian inference provides us with a quantitative description of the in-host dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Model predictions for the infectious and total viral loads for 16 participants of the human challenge study are provided in Figure 1 . From the posterior mixture distribution (Figure 2 ), we estimate that during the early stages of infection, productively infected cells are lost at an average rate of 1.17 day \u22121 . By day 14, once an adaptive immune response is more established, this rate increases to 16.12 day \u22121 . Individual infected cells produce infectious virus at rate 3.74 PFU/ml day \u22121 which is considerably lower than the production of viral RNA at rate 2.57 \u00d7 10 3 RNA copies/mL day \u22121 . The within-host basic reproduction number represents the number of secondary cellular infections a single infected cells causes in a population of fully susceptible cells, and is given here by R 0 = \u03b2T (0)p inf /\u03b4c inf . Using the mixture distribution to derive an estimate of the within-host basic reproduction number gives R 0 = 11. Note that this estimate will likely decrease as the infection progresses due to the shortened lifespan of productively infected cells.",

One limitation of our current analysis is that in some participants, RNA copies/mL remained high after the end of the 14-day study period. As a result, there is greater uncertainty in our predictions after this time which leads to greater uncertainty in the tail of the PCR positive distribution.

As a result, estimates of the infectious period based on these studies are generally longer than that predicted here [14, 35] . A recent within-host model defines the infectious period to be the time when an individual's transmission probability exceeds 10% of its maximum value, obtaining estimates ranging between 1.9 days and 7.9 days that lie towards the lower end of our predicted distribution [18] .

Approaches based on viral load are preferable because they can be used to represent infectiousness on a continuous scale (such as a probability), whereas culture positivity only provides a binary outcome. Furthermore, viral load curves for infectious virus are beneficial as they provide a measure of the amount of virus capable of causing infection. Therefore, whilst our assumption that an individual is infectious if their infectious viral load exceeds 5 PFU/mL may be too simple, the predictions of infectious virus obtained here can be used alongside existing dose-response methods to provide more accurate estimates of infectiousness [8, 36] .",

With further information regarding T-cell responses and antibody levels following vaccination, such multi-scale models could be extended to consider the impact of waning immunity on susceptibility and transmission [38] . The results presented here are specific to wild-type SARS-CoV-2 virus, however, there is wide interest in variants of the virus since these have been associated with increased transmission and can rapidly spread throughout a population. One advantage of mechanistic models is that the parameters have simple interpretations, therefore, when the Delta variant reportedly showed a 10-fold increase in spike-mediated entry compared to a wild-type strain, this can be explicitly accounted for in the cellular infection rate [39] . The viral dynamics framework described here has also been extended to account for the genetic drift of viruses caused by mutations that occur during replication [40] . Applying this to SARS-CoV-2 virus may help understand the potential for new variants to arise within-host, with a recent report suggesting that the spike protein evolves to resist antibodies in immunocompromised individuals that have persistent infections [41] . Altogether, within-host models offer important insights into the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 virus and the host, however, it is the subsequent applications of these models that are most relevant for informing policy and decision making.",
