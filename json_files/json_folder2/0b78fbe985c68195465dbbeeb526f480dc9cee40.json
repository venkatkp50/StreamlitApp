In May 2020, some regions in the United States began to partly reopen. In this research note, we examine how small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in those regions performed after reopening, via a quantitative analysis of survey data that tests whether (a) dynamic capabilities (DCs) improved performance and (b) SME size moderates this link.",

The most common theme is captured by commentaries that study COVID-19's disproportionate effects for certain groups.

Yet, a gap remains with respect to findings on operational efficacy that may be leveraged by SMEs to improve performance or even thrive in challenging times. Thus, while Brown et al. ( , 2021 and Cowling et al. (2020) offer findings that policymakers may use to guide their efforts, we offer findings that businesses may use to form strategies. And while Manolova et al. (2020) document strategies used by proactive women-owned businesses attempting to navigate today's volatile business environment, we quantitatively test a strategy to see whether it actually improved performance during COVID-19. We do so by testing the ability of DCs to improve the performance of SMEs during COVID-19. Teece et al. (1997) define DCs as 'the firm's ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external competences to address rapidly changing environments ' (p. 516) . While ordinary capabilities focus on day-to-day operations, dynamic capabilities focus on competitive strategies in turbulent settings (Ambrosini and Bowman, 2009; Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000; Schilke et al., 2018) . DCs thus seem relevant to firm performance when turbulence is extreme, such as during financial crises (Ahn et al., 2018; Nair et al., 2014) and natural disasters (Martinelli et al., 2018) . Extreme levels of environmental disruption and uncertainty allow the COVID-19 pandemic to serve as a 'stress test' on the impact of DCs on business resiliency and survival prospects.",

The government passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act in March 2020. In particular, its Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDLs) sought to stabilise small business finances in proportion to their employment size and operational expenses. PPP loans were forgivable if used to maintain existing payrolls or rehire workers. By the first week of May, over 90% of all loans totalling nearly US$500 billion were distributed among SMEs across the nation (Kapinos, 2021) . As a result, unlike during previous crises, government relief aid helped to level the playing field for SMEs of different sizes. This allows us to seek and ultimately offer fresh insights into the role of DCs in SME performance.",

            "text": "Our central premise is pithy: a theory designed to predict performance in dynamic settings should be especially useful during a pandemic that is highly volatile and uncertain. Consider the analysis by Teece et al. (2016) of the underappreciated difference between risk (with quantifiable probabilities) and uncertainty, as 'deep uncertainty' (unknown unknowns) shifts importance from efficiency-based to agility-based DCs. While risk can be managed via hedging or codified contingency plans, uncertainty favours flexible approaches. We believe this insight maps onto the business environment in the shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic. To be specific, the literature suggests that DCs are most helpful when industry turbulence is high, due to their ability to add value when settings are dynamic and disruptive (Helfat and Peteraf, 2009; Teece et al., 1997) . We suggest that pandemics are more sudden and disruptive than conventional turbulence. The literature also suggests that the main way DCs add value is by facilitating adaptions that realign resource configurations with novel environments (Jarzabkowski and Wilson, 2006; Teece et al., 1997) ; we suggest that pandemics produce such novel environments. Finally, the literature suggests that the pace of adaptation can matter, and that DCs can help firms pivot quickly to facilitate fits between business models and changed environments (Pavlou and El Sawy, 2010; Wilhelm et al., 2015) . We suggest that the combination of sudden disruption and extreme novelty during COVID-19 means that the ability of SMEs to decide how to pivot and do so quickly is more important than before, while the need for some to do so before going out of business is stronger.",

            "text": "Next, we explore whether the positive effect of DCs on performance is stronger for larger or smaller SMEs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The empirical literature suggests that organisational size is positively related to DC efficacy, due mainly to the inability of smaller firms to create well-funded formal processes (e.g. via R&D or market research groups) that are routinised and systematised and, thus, more scalable and repeatable (Caloghirou et al., 2004; Hern\u00e1ndez-Linares et al., 2020) . Arend (2014) confirms that when analyses are restricted to SMEs (excluding larger firms altogether), smaller SMEs are less likely to possess formal, routinised DCs. Importantly, the more spontaneous, emergent processes that characterise the DCs of smaller SMEs may facilitate quick adaptations that outperform planned DCs when turbulence is extreme or unexpected (Pavlou and El Sawy, 2010; Wilhelm et al., 2015) . Teece et al. (2016) illustrate the trade-off between well-planned DCs of larger firms that rely upon scale-based efficiencies versus the spontaneous pivots of smaller firms by comparing the latter with Britain's small but agile ships that, during the Battle of Trafalgar, outperformed large French and Spanish vessels via their ability to rapidly assess and quickly adapt to changing conditions. Chaotic conditions meant that strategies and capabilities built around the centralisation and coordination of large assets became more cumbersome than fearsome. Connecting this lesson to business strategy, Teece et al. (2016: 24) note that 'hierarchy can be the enemy of agility', leaving the resultant choice-set available to larger organisations 'ill adapted to environments of rapid change'. During the chaos of COVID-19, then, the more emergent processes utilised by smaller SMEs may be more capable of quickly detecting and implementing beneficial adaptations.",

Next, smallness enhances the ability to quickly pivot from old to new business models, as the quick reconfiguration of resources is easier when organisations are agile and less saddled with embedded structures, routines, political factions, bureaucracy and other inertial anchors (Eggers, 2020; Kraus et al., 2020; Teece, 2011; Uhlaner et al., 2013) .

Opportunities to reconfigure resources to meet changing needs may thus be directly recognised by this owner, or by someone very close to them, for example, a key customer, supplier or employee. The subsequent decision to pivot can then be made quickly, perhaps at the sole discretion of the owner, who may be able to inspire immediate 'buy-in' from employees who feel like 'a part of the family', that is, 'in this fight against COVID together'. Relationships with external stakeholders may also be more personal in nature, and this may facilitate the acquisition of scarce resources needed to enable the pivot, for example, a supplier or banker who has been a family friend for years may be more apt to come through in a pinch.",

In March 2020, the US government enacted policy measures in response to COVID-19 under the CARES Act to specifically help small businesses. The infusion of working capital via its PPP and EIDL programme helped to level the playing field for SMEs of different sizes. In other words, the resource advantages possessed by larger SMEs before COVID-19 struck would have diminished to some degree due to federal aid. The absence of such advantages as potential confounding factors allows us to better disentangle the effects of DCs on SMEs on different sizes. With respect to proportionality, larger SMEs derive revenue from broader DC sets and spread development costs over larger bases (Arend, 2014; D\u00f8ving and Gooderham, 2008) . This suggests an interesting crisis implication: effective DCs quickly implemented by smaller SMEs may comprise a larger percentage of their operations and revenue.",

The lack of established scales and a desire to capture discrete subchannels (e.g. the ability to sense new opportunities vs the ability to capitalise on them) have also led to the creation of long formative scales that aggregate DC perceptions across different processes and are adapted to settings on a study-by-study basis (Arend, 2014; Kump et al., 2019; Pavlou and El Sawy, 2010) .",

After conferring with subject matter experts (to gauge construct validity) and consulting both the DC and multi-item measurement literatures (to assess the validity of general vs specific DC measures and single versus multi-item measures), we decided to employ a general, three-item DC measure. 2 Our DC variable was thus measured via a Likert-type scale, from disagree (1) to agree (5). This scale captured the views of respondents of their business capabilities during COVID-19 via three items: (a) 'My business quickly developed new capabilities to meet customer needs during the stay-at-home period', (b) 'New operating capabilities developed after the stay-athome orders allow my business to meet customer needs today' and (c) 'My business has continued to improve its capacity in meeting customer needs after the stay-at-home orders ended'. We applied principal component analysis to these three items. As a measure of scale reliability, the Cronbach's \u03b1 statistic of 0.71 suggests that the three instruments are internally consistent. SME size as a moderating variable for the DCs-performance relationship and is measured by the number of employees as indicated by respondents in the survey. To minimise nonlinear effects due to staffing size disparities, we applied natural log transformation to the data.

Interestingly, we also found strong evidence regarding firm size that is contrary to popular findings in the literature (Eggers, 2020; Lee, 2009 ). Our findings regarding SME size extend DC theory by introducing a new boundary condition that suggests that under certain conditions (e.g. during crisis), the established positive link between size and DC efficacy is reversed, as smallness helps rather than hurts performance. More important perhaps, are the implications of our findings for practice. Managerial guidance that has been empirically validated during COVID-19 is in short supply. We can now say, with some degree of confidence, that SMEs that cultivated DCs outperformed those that did not. Despite the DC literature's suggestions that large firms benefit most from DCs, our results suggest that SME managers should clearly consider employing DCs -especially during COVID-19. In fact, our finding that DC efficacy was stronger for smaller SMEs suggests that no SME manager, regardless of how small their business is, should assume that DCs are only for businesses bigger than theirs. The literature describes several SME channels that facilitate their ability to create DCs via spontaneous and emergent processes that allow SMEs to pivot more rapidly than larger firms. Our results suggest that these processes may be especially valuable during the chaos of COVID-19. For example, we suggest that SME managers pay particular attention to the fact that they are well-positioned to quickly receive direct information from stakeholders (e.g. front-line employees, customers, suppliers) with respect to emerging market gaps. SME managers would also do well to take advantage of relationships with key external stakeholders (e.g. lenders, suppliers) that are more likely to be personal in nature versus less personal links between large corporations. And SME managers should keep in mind that resource reconfigurations are easier when resource bases are simpler and when 'buy-in' can be achieved by personally and quickly appealing to a small number of key employees.",

Restaurant Ocean234, meanwhile, relied on takeout orders to stay afloat, until a trip to the grocery store and a conversation with a local non-profit organisation provided a eureka moment for owner, Danielle Rosse. Leveraging relationships with her suppliers allowed her to utilise existing meal preparation capacity to feed hungry children who were not in school, while extending her access to hard-to-find items like hand sanitiser, eggs and toilet paper to the community. Within 24 hours, it began transforming into a community market that not only thrives during COVID-19 but is viewed as an important citizen that delivers vital services when others cannot.

To measure current operating levels, respondents were asked to indicate the operating level of their business at the time of the survey against the benchmark of 100% of their 'normal', pre-pandemic capacity. The range is between 0 and 100. For the question on revenue, respondents were asked to indicate the percentage change between the level during the survey and the 'normal' pre-pandemic level. 2. Regarding the efficacy of general versus specific dynamic capability (DC) measures, Pezeshkan et al. (2016) documents 173 tests of general measures on measures of performance and/or competitive advantage, with support ranging from 54% to 67% depending on whether effects were direct or moderated. This compares favourably to 45%-59% of supported tests when using specific measures. Furthermore, studies comparing the validity of multi-versus single-item measures suggest that (a) multi-item scales are 'unnecessary' and 'single-item measures should be used' Rossiter, 2007: 175, 2009: 607) or, conversely, (b) multi-item measures show larger validities in most cases, but the magnitude can be small, and under certain circumstances (e.g. when cross-item correlations are less than 0.3 or general questions are asked), 'single items appear to be a reasonably safe bet' (Diamantopoulos et al., 2012) . While we do not use a single-item DC measure, these studies (and the fact that our DC correlations never exceed 0.3) do nevertheless provide a degree of reassurance with respect to the utility of our three-item instrument (especially since this is, essentially, an exploratory research note with a predictor that is, at this stage, general). 3. While all industries were categorised according to established industry codes, we grouped some industries together into larger clusters because they had very few observations: trade sector (wholesale, retail and transportation), hospitality sector (arts and entertainment, and accommodation and food services) and business service sector (information, finance, real estate, professional and management). 4. For industry categories, our benchmark, the goods production sector (agricultural, mining, manufacturing), was left out of the model to avoid perfect collinearity in estimations. 5. While we obtained information from some firms about the actual loan amount received and the number of employees retained because of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act Policies, we omitted them because these numbers were correlated with the self-evaluated CARES Act measures, and also because they would have substantially reduced our sample size due to the fact that the majority of small and medium-sized enterprises chose not to answer these questions.",
