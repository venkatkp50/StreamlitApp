This work was inspired by the classic article [4] by Mestre-Schoof-Washington-Zagier determining the structure of the homophonic group H. The group H has a similar definition to A except anagrams are replaced by homophones. The main result of [4] is that H is trivial (in both English and French!); moreover it can reasonably be said that H is independent of the dictionary chosen, in that the words witnessing the triviality of each generator should belong to anything calling itself an English language dictionary. A similar study of homophonic groups for German, Korean, and Turkish was carried out in [2] .",

However, not all of the commutator relations in A that appear in theorem 1.1 are directly obtainable from anagrams in this way. In section 2 we describe how some anagram relations can be simplified in the presence of commutators, in order that more commutators may be exhibited as coming from anagram relations. Section 3 describes the algorithm used to search the dictionary for commutators. For the specific case of the SOWPODS scrabble dictionary we discuss our findings in section 4. As it turns out the author has a surprising personal connection to the history of the study of the group A, which is recounted in section 5.

Many of these provide no new relation, for example quickest = quickset is already implied by our knowledge that e, s, t commute.

Remark 4.3. One consequence of the fact that N \u2287 R(SOWPODS) is that if [\u03b1, \u03b2] is one of the 24 exceptional commutators which do not appear in N , then all SOWPODS anagrams containing both the characters \u03b1 and \u03b2 have the same pattern of \u03b1 and \u03b2 appearing. So for example there is no anagram pair W 1 , W 2 in the SOWPODS dictionary where W 1 contains a j and then an x, while W 2 contains an x and then a j. So in a sense A(SOWPODS) is maximally abelian, in that any commutator which could possibly arise from anagrams in the SOWPODS dictionary does arise.",

As it turns out, there is a long and storied history of grad students at the University of Chicago studying anagrammatic groups, stretching back at least to the 1970s. While following up on references from the article [4] , the author stumbled across [3] . The article [3] is an account of several whimsical math problems studied by a group of grad students at the University of Chicago in the 1970s. Apparently there was at that time a tradition of grad students attempting to determine the structure of the group A by hand, with generations of student work being logged in a large paper chart posted on the fourth floor of the mathematics building. Without computer assistance, several letters had been shown to be in the center of the group, and anagrams exhibiting many of the possible commutator pairs had been filled in on the chart.",
