            "text": "health officials, and has the potential to contribute to decisions related to vaccine research and development. 62 For the public, predictions of the efficacy and safety of a vaccine may lessen vaccine hesitancy [72] [73] [74] [75] . 63 For public health officials, predictions of the time to approval and time to manufacture a vaccine serve as 64 valuable input in supply chain management, including logistics planning, inventory management, material 65 requirements planning [76] [77] [78] . For those in vaccine research and development, probabilistic predictions may 66 help determine which vaccine platforms and pathways should be pursued before others [79] [80] [81] [82] . 67 To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to generate ensemble probabilistic predictions from 68 expert and generalist forecasters on COVID-19 vaccine development and share these with the public and 69 public health decision-makers from June 2020 through September 2020, before the first approved COVID- Subject matter experts (SMEs) and trained forecasters (definition below) participated in four surveys from 76 June 15th, 2020 to August 30th, 2020. SMEs and forecasters were asked to predict aspects of safety, efficacy, 77 and delivery of a COVID-19 vaccine (see [35] to view all four summary reports, questions asked of forecasters 78 and collected prediction data used in this work. In addition, names and affiliations of forecasters who chose 79 to volunteer this information is provided at the end of each summary report.). 80 Subject matter experts and trained forecasters were solicited by sending personal emails (see Supp. S7 for a 81 template email sent to subject matter experts). Solicitation started on June 3, 2020 and ended on July 8, 82 2020. 83 The first two weeks of each month (the 1st to the 14th) were used to develop questions that could address 84 changing information about a COVID-19 vaccine. 85 Forecasters received a set of questions on the 15th of each month and from the 15th to the 25th could submit 86 predictions using the Metaculus platform [83] . Forecasters made a first prediction and, as many times as 87 they wished, could revise their original prediction between the 15th and 25th. To reduce anchoring bias [84] , 88 between the 15th and the 20th forecasters made predictions without knowledge of other forecaster's predictive 89 densities. From the 20th to the 25th a community predictive density-an equally weighted combination of 90 predictive densities from subject matter experts and trained forecasters-was available to forecasters. 92 We defined a subject matter expert as someone with training in the fields of molecular and cellular biology, 93 microbiology, virology, biochemistry, and infectious diseases, and who has several years of experience in vac-94 cine, antiviral, and/or biological research related to infectious agents and kept up-to-date with vaccine and 95 antiviral research specifically focused on SARS-CoV-2/ COVID-19. Subject matter experts were trained in 96 biological sciences but were not required to have had prior experience making accurate, calibrated proba-97 bilistic predictions. Subject matter experts were recruited by asking for volunteers who were members of II.4. Forecasting platform 135 Forecasters submitted predictive densities by accessing the Metaculus platform (Metaculus), an online fore-136 casting platform that allows users to submit predictive densities and comments related to a proposed question. 137 When using the platform, a forecaster can submit an initial prediction for a question and choose to revise 138 their original prediction as many times as they wish. Metaculus stores individual predictions and comments 139 for each question and when the ground truth for a question is available the platform scores individual predic-140 tions and keeps a history of each forecaster's average score across all questions for which they have submitted 141 predictions. The Metaculus platform allows participants to visualize their proposed predictive density both 142 as probability density and cumulative density functions.",

The 162 email contained summary information about the questions presented to forecasters and a line list of each 163 question. Questions were formatted as hyperlinks that directed forecasters to the forecasting platform 164 and corresponding question that they clicked. Forecasters were given the dates when predictions could be 165 submitted and dates for when the real-time and past community predictions could be observed. The email 166 also reiterated for forecasters where they can find reports on past questions asked and that questions and 167 feedback could be sent to the authors (an example email is presented in Supp. S8).",

The domain (D) is 181 typically a closed interval of the real number line where the lower (L) and upper bounds (U ) of the interval 182 are chosen to contain all possible outcomes (D = [L, U ]). In some cases an additional outcome allows 183 forecasters to assign probability to an open-ended outcome falling outside the upper or lower bound of the 184 domain (D = \u2113 \u222a [L, U ] \u222a \u03c5). For example, for the question \"When will a COVID-19 vaccine show an efficacy 185 of greater than or equal to 70%?\" a forecaster could assign a probability density from Aug, 2020 to April, 186 2023 and to the outcome \"later than April, 2023\". 187 An ensemble prediction of up to five logistic distributions submitted by an individual forecaster is stored 188 by the forecasting platform as an array of 200 density values evaluated at 200 equally spaced points from 189 the minimum to maximum allowable values (i.e. 200 equally spaced values in [L, U ]).

The community distribution was updated after the 25th as individuals made 233 new predictions or if an individual revised their previous prediction. 234 II.10. Data, Code, and Report availability 235 Data and code used in this project can be found on an actively maintained GitHub repository at https: 236 //github.com/computationalUncertaintyLab/vaccinceAndTherapeuticsCrowd. In addition to technical 237 information, this repository includes summary reports that were generated and include: a summary page of 238 predictions provided by experts and trained forecasters, detailed linear pool probability density functions, a 239 record of the questions that were asked, and a table listing of subject matter experts and trained forecasters 240 who volunteered identifying information. Data on ground truth used to compute log scores for fifteen 241 questions can be found in supplemental table S3. 242 Summary reports were sent to members of the CDC to aid in public health decision making. However, we 243 did not rigorously collect feedback about the impact of these reports. 244 III. RESULTS 245 III.1. Participation and response rate of the crowd 246 Four monthly surveys were conducted in June, July, August, and September of 2020. A total of 10 individual 247 experts and 11 trained forecasters participated in at least one of the four surveys. On average 6 experts 248 participated (made at least one prediction for one question) per survey and an average of 8 trained forecasters 249 participated per survey. The median number of hours after the survey was open until the first prediction by 250 an expert was 12 hours and by a trained forecaster was 9 hours, and the last prediction made by an expert 251 was on average 6 hours and for a trained forecaster 2 hours before survey close. 252 Experts and trained forecasters (the crowd) were asked on average 6.5 questions and made on average 132.5 253 unique and revised predictions per survey. In June we asked 6 questions and received 154 total (unique and 254 revised) predictions (26 predictions per question), in July we asked 7 questions and received 148 predictions 255 (21 predictions per question), in August we asked 8 questions and received 153 predictions (19 predictions per 256 question), and in September we asked 5 questions and received 75 predictions (15 predictions per question).257 Comments were made on 21 out of 26 questions (80.7%) with an average of 2.2 comments per question across all four surveys and a maximum number of comments of 8 on the question asked in June \"When will 259 a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate demonstrate \u2265 70% efficacy?\". 260 The truth was determined for 15 out of 26 questions asked of the crowd. Supplemental table S3 lists the 261 questions where truth was determined and the true value used to score the crowd. 262 III.2. Efficacy 263 Linear pool median predictions of when a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine would show an efficacy above 70% were later 264 than the truth, and linear pool predictions of the reported efficacy of a vaccine were smaller than the truth, 265 independent of whether the question asked about specific methods of vaccine delivery or about different 266 approval processes. 267 We asked trained forecasters and experts eight questions, two in June, four in July, and two in August, 268 related to the efficacy of a COVID-19 vaccine (Fig. 1) and received 160 predictions (20 predictions per 269 question on average). 270 The first vaccine to show an efficacy greater than or equal to 70% was the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, reporting 271 an efficacy of 95% on Dec. 10, 2020 [31]. The linear pool predicted an efficacy this high would not occur 272 until after 2020, assigning a 0.85 probability to Jan. 2021 or later for when a COVID-19 vaccine would show 273 an efficacy of greater than or equal to 70%. The linear pool median prediction made in June, 2020 for when 274 a vaccine would show an efficacy above 70% was Aug. 13, 2021, the mode was July 1, 2021, and the 90% 275 confidence interval (CI) was [Oct., 2020, May, 2023](Fig. 1A.).276The most recently reported efficacy of the ChAdOx1 vaccine was 61.2%[93]. The linear pool median 277 prediction made in June, 2020 for the efficacy of the ChAdOx1 vaccine was 55.2% (80CI: [7.5%, 83.6%]) 278 with a probability of 0.27 assigned to values between 60% and 80% and a probability of 0.13 assigned to an 279 efficacy below 10%(Fig. 1B.).",

DISCUSSION 370 Between July and September 2020, a linear pool of trained forecasters and experts in infectious disease and 371 vaccinology provided predictions that: (i) quantified uncertainty about the efficacy, safety, and timing of 372 approval of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines at a time when the vaccine landscape and relevant political considerations 373 were in flux; (ii) were made when there was sparse data on past development of pharmaceutical interventions 374 in response to a pandemic, and (iii) were fast and to the best of our knowledge were made before any 375 other human judgment or computational efforts to predict COVID-19 vaccine characteristics and timing. 376 Aggregated predictions of this small team of trained forecasters and subject-matter experts emphasizes how 377 timely and quantitative insights on key open questions of a rapidly changing emergency situation can be 378 provided via a quick, low-cost, and flexible process of forecast elicitation and aggregation. 379 We have the following five key takeaways from conducting this elicitation for others who plan to conduct a 380 similar project that involves expert solicitation and linear pool building in a fast-paced environment: 381 1. Linking questions that participants predict to information needed by public health decision makers 382 is of utmost importance. When possible, questions should be reviewed by public health officials and 383 others who may use these predictions to inform their decisions. 384 2. A forecasting platform is an important tool that simplifies submitting predictions. A platform should 385 allow the user to make predictions in the same way across questions and make it easy to revise predic-386 tions as the user's information about the question grows.",

            "text": "When asked to predict vaccine efficacy the linear pool assigned significant probability to values as low as 401 40% and up to 100%.402    The uncertainty in the linear pool distribution underlines the diverse signals the crowd received from the 403 environment, opposing views between different members of the crowd, the deployment of a novel mRNA 404 vaccine, and difficulty translating past experience in vaccine research to novel vaccine development during a 405 pandemic.406In line with ground truth, the linear pool assigned high probabilities to efficacy values above 70% for the407 Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and to vaccines based on four different vaccine technology platforms [98]. With 408 that said, the linear pool median predictions made in August 2020 of the efficacy of a vaccine approved under emergency authorization was 50%, greatly underestimating the 95% efficacy of the Pfizer/BioNTech 410 vaccine [31]. In addition to underestimating the efficacy of the first authorized vaccine, linear pool predictions 411 for all questions related to efficacy assigned positive probabilities to values below the 50% threshold for 412 approval stated by the FDA. 413 Similar to predictions of efficacy, linear pool forecasts underestimated the speed of vaccine development. 414 The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was approved Dec. 10th and on July 17th 2020 Dexamethasone-an anti-415 inflammatory treatment-was shown to have a significant benefit to survival [94]. The linear pool in July 416 2020 assigned a small probability to a vaccine being approved before or on Dec. 10th, 2020, and the linear 417 pool median prediction made in June 2020 for when a COVID-19 therapy would show a survival benefit was 418 approximately eight months later than the true date. Predictions that underestimated the speed of vaccine 419 approval could be because forecasters relied too heavily on previous development timelines. 420 An often-overlooked advantage of human judgment forecasting is the ability of a forecaster to transform 421 text data from the environment, such as news articles and scientific literature, into a prediction and output 422 textual data to (i) backup their predictions and (ii) communicate to other forecasters potentially important 423 information. For example, forecasters suggested political considerations may influence the timing of the 424 vaccine authorization/approval process in the U.S. with one forecaster pointing out on June 16th that 425 \"pressure on the FDA to approve something will be enormous, and will start building once there are even 426 preliminary phase 3 results.\" After our August survey closed and before the September survey opened, 427 President Trump announced a vaccine might be approved before the 2020 election. We suggest political 428 considerations could have influenced forecasts, shifting the median prediction for when a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine 429 will be approved in the US under emergency authorization from Feb, 2021 to Jan, 2021 and the median 430 prediction under a standard approval process from July, 2021 to Oct., 2021. Though an advantage of human 431 forecasters is their ability to generate commentary that may present new information to other forecasters 432",

A subset of 451 questions will resolve over time but many questions may never resolve because the criteria to determine the 452 truth was too strict.453   The number of unresolved questions highlights that those who pose the questions are as important as those 454 who submits predictions. To generate questions, the coauthors drew upon information from recent scientific 455 literature, reports by the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.456A more rigorous approach to generating questions could include criteria for determining the expected time 457 until a question has ground truth and asking public health officials to either contribute questions or vote on 458 questions they would like to have answered. Those who author questions must make their own prediction 459 about whether they expect to obtain ground truth. For example, we expected vaccines to be approved by 460 both emergency and standard approval pathways within a short period of time, but this was not the case.461Because emergency authorization was granted to vaccines first with a large volume of vaccines administered 462 and distributed before standard approval, any question that was related to a vaccine approved through a 463 standard pathway was unresolved. This work suggests that question building may require a careful balance 464 between addressing relevant public health concerns while at the same time asking questions that will have 465 ground truth.466    We want to emphasize that further experimental work is needed to determine the correct pool of forecasters467 from which to solicit probabilistic predictions, the proper way to formulate questions, and a comparison of 468 techniques to aggregate predictions. To address which pool of forecasters to solicit predictions, we plan to 469 present subject matter experts and trained forecasters the trajectories of two potentially related random 470 variables for which we know the ground truth and solicit predictions. Comparisons can be made between 471 subject matter experts and trained forecasters overall, by varying the difficulty of the predictive task: (i) 472 reducing the correlation between these two random variables or (ii) increasing the variability in one or both 473 random variables, or by varying the degree to which one random variable is linearly related or non-linearly 474 related to the other. This work weighted equally predictive distributions from subject matter experts and 475 trained forecasters, and further work is needed that explores assigning weights to forecasters based on past 476 predictive performance and characteristics of one's forecast that may suggest improved or weakened accuracy. 477 Human judgement forecasting of progress towards a vaccine can be viewed as a tool to support primary 478 preventative measures against an infectious agent. Probabilistic forecasts can target multiple audiences 479 to support the public when making complex decisions about their health under uncertainty and support 480 both short term and long-term health promotion practices implemented by public health officials. Because 481 vaccination is a low frequency, voluntary event, forecasts did not aim to modify the public's sense of control 482 or desire to engage in inoculation. Instead, forecasts were made easily accessible online and aimed to help 483 ready individuals at all risk levels for vaccination and understand the impact of their decisions on their own 484 and on other's health. Predictions from a linear pool of the efficacy, safety, and timing of a vaccine may 485 have been accurate enough to improve situational awareness for public health officials. 486 V.
