Observational studies link PPI therapy in cirrhotic patients with an increased risk for infectious complications, hepatic encephalopathy and an increased risk for hospitalization and mortality. However, patients with liver cirrhosis are also considered to be at risk for peptic ulcer bleeding. The STOPPIT trial evaluates if discontinuation of a pre-existing PPI treatment delays a composite endpoint of re-hospitalization and/or death in patients (recently) hospitalized with liver cirrhosis compared to patients on continued PPI medication.",

            "text": "The STOPPIT-trial is a prospective, multicentre, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallelgroup trial. In total, 476 patients with complicated liver cirrhosis who already receive long-term PPI therapy without evidence-based indication are 1:1 randomized to receive either esomeprazole 20 mg (control group) or placebo (intervention group) for 360 days. Patients with an indication for PPI therapy (such as a recent diagnosis of peptic ulcers, severe reflux esophagitis, severe hemorrhagic gastritis, recent endoscopic therapy for oesophageal varices) are excluded. The primary composite endpoint is the time-to re-hospitalization and/or death. Secondary endpoints include rates of re-hospitalization, mortality, occurrence of infections, hepatic decompensation and acute-on-chronic liver failure. The safety endpoint is defined as manifestation of an evidence-based indication for PPI re-therapy. The impact of PPI continuation or discontinuation on the intestinal microbiota will be studied. The recruitment will take place at 18 study sites throughout Germany. Recruitment has started in April 2021. Discussion: The STOPPIT trial is the first clinical trial to study the effects of PPI withdrawal on relevant outcome variables in patients with complicated liver cirrhosis. If the hypothesis that PPI withdrawal improves clinical outcomes of cirrhosis patients is confirmed, this would argue for a strong restriction of the currently liberal prescription practice of PPIs in this population. If, on the other hand, the trial demonstrates an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding events in patients after PPI withdrawal, this could create a rationale for a more liberal, prophylactic PPI treatment in patients with liver cirrhosis.",

Observational and retrospective studies suggest that PPI use in cirrhosis patients may be a risk factor for infections [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] , especially spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) [8-10, 15, 16] . Increased SBP rates in cirrhotic patients may be explained through PPI-associated microbiotic shifts leading to small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and bacterial translocation [17] [18] [19] [20] . PPI therapy was also suggested as a possible risk factor for pneumonia [10, 21, 22] and Clostridium difficile infections in cirrhotic patients [23] . However, other observational studies found no evidence for an association of PPI use and the risk of development of pneumonia [24] , SBP [25] [26] [27] or infections in general [27] . Moreover, an association between episodes of (overt) hepatic encephalopathy and PPI use has been reported [6, 7, 9, 28, 29] . Infections and hepatic encephalopathy may often cause hospitalizations of cirrhotic patients. PPI use at discharge and PPI-mediated microbiotic shifts have also been associated to early rehospitalization [20, 30, 31] . Also, PPI use has been reported to be an independent predictor for mortality in cirrhotic patients [5, 6, 10, 32, 33] and in a large North-American veteran cohort, as well as in patients with malignant diseases [34] [35] [36] . Again, other studies found no association between PPI use and mortality of cirrhotic patients [4, 27] .",

However, this patient population is considered to be at a high risk of gastrointestinal haemorrhage from peptic ulcers [37] [38] [39] [40] . Importantly, peptic ulcer bleeding in patients with liver cirrhosis is associated with an increased mortality as compared to patients without cirrhosis [41] [42] [43] , and mortality rates of cirrhotic patients with peptic ulcer bleeding are comparable to cirrhotic patients with bleeding from oesophageal varices [44] . Therefore, generous PPI use may also have a yet unproven preventive effect against upper gastrointestinal bleeding events. Short term use of PPIs for up to 10 days may reduce ulcer size after endoscopic variceal band ligation [45, 46] , but there is no evidence for protective effects of PPI therapy against portal hypertension-related bleeding in cirrhotic patients who did not receive endoscopic ligation therapy [47] .",

The risk to reach the primary endpoint in the PPI withdrawal group is assumed to be 50% after 6 months, due to a reduction of mortality [4-6, 8, 10, 11] and a decreased risk for infectious complications [8] [9] [10] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] , which results in a lower risk for re-hospitalization [20] . This corresponds to a HR of 0.66 of the intervention group compared to the control group. The sample size calculation is performed on the assumed event rates of 50% in the intervention group (PPI withdrawal) and 65% for the control group after 6 months with a two-sided significance level \u03b1 of 5% and a power of 80%, which requires a total number of 184 events to be observed. With a follow-up period of exactly 360 days per patient and an estimated 20% random loss to follow-up or non-compliance it can safely be assumed that a sufficient number of events will have been observed by the end of the trial if a total of 475 patients are available for analysis (based on the logrank test; PASS 16.0.3).

However, the negative impact of chronic PPI treatment on infection rates [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [21] [22] [23] , rates of hepatic decompensation [6, 7, 9, 28, 29] , hospitalization rates [20, 30, 31] and mortality of cirrhotic patients [5, 6, 10, 32, 33] remains controversial due to conflicting data [4, [24] [25] [26] [27] . Therefore, it remains unclear if PPI use is causative for patient mortality or merely associated with comorbidities which themselves lead to a higher mortality in patients [51, 52] . On the other hand, patients with liver cirrhosis are at an increased risk of variceal and nonvariceal gastrointestinal bleedings [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] and PPI could have preventive effects.",

As the above-mentioned complications regularly lead to a hospitalization of cirrhotic patients and a hospitalization itself is considered a risk factor for mortality in patients with liver cirrhosis [50] , rehospitalization is an adequate surrogate for patientrelevant complications of liver cirrhosis. By aggregation of unplanned re-hospitalization and mortality to a composite endpoint, we avoid underestimation of clinically significant events resulting in pre-clinical mortality. However, this implies a risk that mortality will be underrepresented in the primary results, as most fatal outcomes are expected to occur after re-hospitalization. Thus, incidence of secondary endpoints including mortality will be studied after re-hospitalization. We will not regard expected re-hospitalization due to ascites (without SBP or other complications) during a period of 30 days after discharge as a primary end-point criterion, as patients with refractory ascites are often expected to be re-hospitalized for paracentesis.",

Furthermore, the incidence of an infection (which is regarded a complication of cirrhosis in our protocol) is often a deteriorating event in the course of cirrhotic disease leading to ACLF [57] . As the study aims to evaluate the discontinuation of widely practiced \"prophylactic\" long-term PPI prescription without strong indication, a PPI therapy has to be documented for \u2265 28 days prior to screening. However, only patients taking a single PPI standard dose per day or less for at least 7 days are included in the trial, as patients receiving higher doses of PPI might be at an increased risk to suffer from gastric acid rebound symptoms [53] [54] [55] despite our PPI dose tapering protocol.",

Patients who underwent endoscopic therapy for oesophageal varices < 14 days prior to screening are also excluded, as PPI therapy may reduce the size of banding-ulcers after variceal band ligation [45, 46] . Patients with a lifeexpectancy below 1 year due to extrahepatic diseases or malignancies are excluded to avoid confounding of the primary efficacy endpoint, as these patients have a high risk to reach the primary endpoint independently from cirrhosis or the trial intervention. Also, patients who are regarded clinically unstable are excluded from the trial.",

If the primary hypothesis (superiority of PPI discontinuation over continuation of PPI therapy) is confirmed, the trial will have significant impact on the recommended drug management of patients with liver cirrhosis. Reduced PPI prescription rates could lead to lower rates of cirrhosis-related complications and may have a positive impact on (re-)hospitalization rates and mortality. Furthermore, PPI discontinuation would possibly lower the \"pill burden\", lower the risk of drug-drug interactions in cirrhotic patients, and may therefore have a positive socioeconomic impact.",
