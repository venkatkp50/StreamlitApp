By contrast, the BTC 204 structures were translocated by one base pair compared to the RTCs; the base 205 pair corresponding to the A-U Watson-Crick base pair at the 3'-end of the p-RNA 206 (located in the -1 site of the RTCs) was in the -2 position of the BTCs (Fig. 1A, 4,  207 and 5B). The -1 position of the BTC was occupied by the first C-A mismatch; the 208 p-RNA -1C made a non-Watson-Crick hydrogen bond with the opposing t-RNA A 209 ( Fig. 4 and 5B) . The next three mismatched p-RNA nucleotides (+1C, +2C, +3C) 210 trailed into the NTP entry tunnel ( Fig. 4 and 5B) . The 3'-nucleotide of the BTC5-211 scaffold p-RNA (+4C; Fig. 1A ) was solvent-exposed at the outward-facing end of 212 the NTP-entry tunnel, lacked density and was therefore not modelled (Fig. 2B) . 213",

In the nsp131-BTC5 and 169 nsp132-BTC5 cryo-EM maps, the single-stranded 5'-segment of the t-RNA was 170 engaged with nsp13.1. This region of the cryo-EM density was well-resolved (Fig. 171 2A), allowing identification of the t-RNA segment engaged within the helicase as 172 +14 to +8 (numbering defined in Figure 1A), 5' CCCAUGU 3' . The five-nucleotide 173 segment connecting the t-RNA between the helicase and the RdRp (+7 to +3) 174 was disordered and not modeled. 175 176 The SARS-CoV-2 RdRp NTP-entry tunnel accommodates the backtracked 177 BTC is analogous to DdRp BTCs [Fig. 3; (14)]. The DdRp bridge helix [BH; (35)] 181 separates the DdRp active site cleft into a channel for the downstream template 182 DNA (over the top of the BH; Fig. 3B) and the NTP-entry tunnel (underneath the 183 BH; Fig. 3B).

            "text": "300 Our findings have implications for the processes of subgenomic transcription 301 and proofreading in SARS-CoV-2 [Fig. 6; (14)]. Generation of mRNAs for the 302 viral structural proteins begins with transcription initiation at the 3'-poly(A) tail of 303 the (+)-strand RNA genome. The process, called sub-genomic transcription, 304 ultimately generates a nested set of transcripts that are both 5'-and 3'-co-305 terminal with the viral genome and involves a remarkable template-switch from 306 the 3'-portion of the genome to the 5'-leader (7, 34). The template-switching 307 event is thought to involve base-pairing between the 3'-end of the nascent 308 transcript and a complementary sequence (the Transcription Regulatory 309 Sequence, or TRS) near the (+)-strand 5'-leader (45). Backtracking could extrude 310 the 3'-end of the nascent transcript out the NTP-entry tunnel, making it available 311 for base pairing to the 5'-TRS (Fig. 6). Our results establishing that the SARS-312 CoV-2 RTC can backtrack validates a key prediction of this model for the 313 mechanism of template-switching during sub-genomic transcription (14). 314 Nucleotide analogs that function by being incorporated into product RNA by 315 viral RdRps are important antiviral therapeutics (46). Notably, their incorporation 316 may induce backtracking by the RdRp (43). Rdv, a nucleotide analog, is the only 317 FDA-approved drug for COVID-19 treatment (5). Our results support a model in 318 misincorporation or incorporation of nucleotide analogs can pause 319the RdRp, allowing nsp13 to engage with the downstream single-stranded t-RNA 320 to induce backtracking (14). The resulting exposure of the p-RNA 3'-end out the 321 NTP-entry tunnel(Fig. 3A and 6) could provide access for the SARS-CoV-2 322 proofreading machinery [nsp10/14; (9, 12)] to degrade the p-RNA 3'-end, thus 323 removing the misincorporation or analog. This proofreading activity, which is 324 unique to the nidovirus order to which CoVs belong (10), is a major determinant 325 for the resistance of CoVs against many nucleotide analog inhibitors (13). Thus, 326understanding RdRp backtracking and its potential role in CoV proofreading can 327 facilitate the development of therapeutics.",

Purified nsp12 and 688 nsp7/8 were mixed in a 1:3 molar ratio and incubated at 22 o C for 15 minutes. ratio. Purified nsp13 was concentrated by centrifugal filtration 693 (Amicon) and buffer exchanged into cryo-EM buffer using Zeba desalting 694 columns. Buffer exchanged nsp13 was mixed with ADP and AlF3 and then added 695 to nsp7/8/12/RNA scaffold at a molar ratio of 1:1 with a final concentration of 696 2 mM ADP-AlF3. Complex was incubated for 5 minutes at 30 o C and further 697 concentrated by centrifugal filtration (Amicon). 698 699 Cryo-EM grid preparation. Prior to grid freezing, 3-([3-700 cholamidopropyl]dimethylammonio)-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPSO, 701 Anatrace) was added to the sample (8 mM final), resulting in a final complex 702 concentration of 10 \u00b5M. The final buffer condition for the cryo-EM sample was 703 20 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 150 mM K-acetate, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 704 2 mM ADP-AlF3, 8 mM CHAPSO. C-flat holey carbon grids (CF-1.2/1.3-4Au, 705 Electron Microscopy Sciences) were glow-discharged for 20 s prior to the 706 application of 3.5 \u03bcL of sample. Using a Vitrobot Mark IV (ThermoFisher 707 Scientific), grids were blotted and plunge-frozen into liquid ethane with 90% 708 chamber humidity at 4\u00b0C. 709 710 Cryo-EM data acquisition and processing. Structural biology software was 711 accessed through the SBGrid consortium (5). Grids were imaged using a 300 kV 712 Titan Krios (ThermoFisher Scientific) equipped with a K3 camera (Gatan) and a 713 BioQuantum imaging filter (Gatan). Images were recorded using Leginon (6) with 714 a pixel size of 1.065 \u00c5/px (micrograph dimensions of 5,760 x 4,092 px) over a 715 nominal defocus range of -0.8 \u03bcm to -2.5 \u03bcm and 30 eV slit width. Movies were 716 recorded in \"counting mode\" (native K3 camera binning 2) with ~30 e-/px/s in 717 dose-fractionation mode with subframes of 50 ms over a 2.5 s exposure (50 718 frames) to give a total dose of ~66 e-/\u00c5. Dose-fractionated movies were gain-from the dose-weighted images with box size of 256 px using 723 cryoSPARC Blob Picker and Particle Extraction. The entire dataset consisted of 724 10,685 motion-corrected images with 4,961,691 particles. Particles were sorted 725 using cryoSPARC 2D classification (N=100), resulting in 2,412,034 curated 726 particles. Initial models (Ref 1: decoy 1, Ref 2: complex, Ref 3: decoy 2; 727 SI Appendix; Fig. S2) were generated using cryoSPARC ab initio Reconstruction 728 on a subset of 85,398 particles. Particles were further curated using Ref 1-3 as 729 3D templates for cryoSPARC Heterogeneous Refinement (N=6), resulting in the 730 following: class1 (Ref 1), 258,097 particles; class2 (Ref 1), 263,966 particles; 731 class3 (Ref 2), 668,743 particles; class4 (Ref 2), 665,480 particles; class5 (Ref 732 3), 280,933 particles; class6 (Ref 3), 274,815 particles. Particles from class3 and 733 class4 were combined and further curated with another round of Heterogeneous 734 Refinement (N=6), resulting in the following: class1 (Ref 1), 67,639 particles; 735 class2 (Ref 1), 61,097 particles; class3 (Ref 2), 553,368 particles; class4 (Ref 2), 736 554,581 particles; class5 (Ref 3), 42,114 particles; class6 (Ref 3), 55,424 737 particles. Curated particles from class3 and class4 were combined, re-extracted 738 with a box size of 320 px, and further classified using Ref 2 as a 3D template for 739 cryoSPARC Heterogeneous Refinement (N=4). Classes from this round of 740 Heterogeneous Refinement (N=4) were as follows: class1 (Ref 2), 871,163 741 particles; class2 (Ref 2), 77,769 particles; class3 (Ref 2), 61,489 particles; class4 742 (Ref 2), 64,026 particles. Particles from class1 and class2 were combined and 743 further sorted using Heterogeneous Refinement (N=4) using class maps as 744 templates, resulting in the following: class1, 134,536 particles; class2, 270,170 745 particles; class3, 294,162 particles; class4, 172,295 particles. Classification 746 revealed two unique classes: nsp131-BTC (class1 and class2) and nsp132-BTC 747 (class3 and class4). Particles within each class were further processed using 748 RELION 3.1-beta Bayesian Polishing(9, 10). Polished particles were refined 749 using cryoSPARC Non-uniform Refinement, resulting in structures with the 750 the resolution of the RNA in the BTC, particles from both classes 753 were combined in a cryoSPARC Non-uniform Refinement and density 754 corresponding to nsp13 was subtracted. Subtracted particles were further refined 755 with cryoSPARC Local Refinement using a mask encompassing the BTC and a 756 fulcrum point defined on the backtracked RNA. This map, BTC5(local), contained 757 871,163 particles with a nominal resolution of 3.23 \u00c5. 758 To improve the density of nsp13.2 in the nsp132-BTC map, particles were 759 subtracted using a mask defined around nsp13.2, leaving residual signal for only 760 nsp13.2. Subtracted particles were classified (N=4) in RELION 3.1 beta using a 761 mask around nsp13.2, resulting in the following classes: class1, 71,607 particles; 762 class2, 163,540 particles; class3, 176,461 particles; class4, 54,849 particles. 763 Subtracted particles in class1 and class2 were combined and reverted back to 764 the original particles, followed by refinement using cryoSPARC Non-uniform 765 Refinement. The resulting map of nsp132-BTC contains 235,147 particles with 766 nominal resolution of 3.59 \u00c5. Local resolution calculations were generated using 767 blocres and blocfilt from the Bsoft package (11). 768 769 Model building and refinement. Initial models were derived from PDB: 6XEZ 770",

The resulting holo-RdRp was added to a modified RNA scaffold 779 Perkin-Elmer). The holo-RdRp/RNA complex was left to 782 incubate for 5 minutes at 30\u00b0C in the dark. Nsp13 and ATP were added to a final 783 concentration of 2 uM and 2 mM, respectively, and incubated for five minutes at 784 30\u00b0C in the dark. The reaction mixture was transferred to a Parafilm covered 785 aluminum block at 4\u00b0C and irradiated with a 365-nm handheld UV lamp. 786Reactions were quenched with LDS sample loading buffer (ThermoFisher 787Scientific) and analyzed by gel electrophoresis on a NuPAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris gel 788 (ThermoFisher) at 150 Volts for 1 hour and visualized by autoradioagraphy. 789 790 Molecular dynamics simulations 791 General simulation setup and parameterization. Proteins, ADP, and ions were 792 parameterized with the DES-Amber SF1.0 force field (15). RNAs were 793 parameterized with the Amber ff14 RNA force field (16) with modified 794 electrostatic, van der Waals, and torsional parameters to more accurately 795 reproduce the energetics of nucleobase stacking (17). The systems were 796 solvated with water parameterized with the TIP4P-D water model (18) and 797 neutralized with 150 mM NaCl buffer. The systems each contained ~887,000 798 atoms in a 190\u00d7190\u00d7190 \u00c5 cubic box. 799 Systems were first equilibrated on GPU Desmond using a mixed NVT/NPT 800 schedule (19), followed by a 1 \u00b5s relaxation simulation on Anton, a special-801 purpose machine for molecular dynamics simulations (20). All production 802 simulations were performed on Anton and initiated from the last frame of the 803 relaxation simulation. Production simulations were performed in the NPT 804 ensemble at 310 K using the Martyna-Tobias-Klein barostat (21). The simulation 805 time step was 2.5 fs, and a modified r-RESPA integrator (22, 23) was used in 806 which long-range electrostatic interactions were evaluated every three time 807 steps. Electrostatic forces were calculated using the u-series method (24). A 9-\u00c5 808 cutoff was applied for the van der Waals calculations. preparation.
