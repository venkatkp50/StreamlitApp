However, positive social experiences might help to break cycles of loneliness by promoting more prosocial cognitions and behaviors.

Despite these platforms' widespread use, there is a lack of research into how their socially interactive elements affect users' feelings of loneliness and connection.",

In small doses, the gnaw of loneliness can be adaptive, motivating us to exert effort to maintain and seek out high-quality social relationships. Yet, when loneliness becomes chronic it can profoundly reduce wellbeing, making us miserable and putting us at risk for disease (2, 3) . Chronic loneliness is strongly associated with social anxiety, depression severity, suicidality, and health-related behaviors, and it predicts mortality to an extent comparable to physical inactivity and lack of access to healthcare (4) (5) (6) . Loneliness is also extremely common: 20% of Americans surveyed in 2008 reported feeling sufficiently isolated for it to be a major source of unhappiness in their lives (4) and nearly half of 20,000 Americans surveyed in 2018 reported sometimes or always feeling that no one knew them very well (7) . The prevalence of loneliness is relatively similar in other Western nations (8) and has remained fairly stable over the past several decades (9, 10) .",

To address these impairments, evidence-based loneliness interventions generally focus on building social skills, improving connection to high-quality social relationships, and challenging maladaptive social cognitions (11) . However, randomized controlled trials of these interventions (11, 12) generally demonstrate weaker effects than most other social and behavioral interventions (13) . In addition, these interventions tend to focus on individuals, rather than populations or systems. Thus, new strategies for addressing loneliness at scale may be needed.",

In particular, live streaming is a form of internet-mediated experience that has grown significantly in popularity since the COVID-19 pandemic began, attracting large global audiences (21) . Live streams are internet-mediated experiences in which users watch an audiovisual presentation and, in some cases, can interact with other viewers and the streamer (i.e., the person presenting) in real-time via a text chat. Several studies have demonstrated these streams' relevance to viewers' feelings of connection and community. For example, a qualitative study of mental health discussion on a major live streaming platform, Twitch (twitch.com), noted the potential for interactivity in live streams to provide users a valuable sense of belonging to a community (22) . Another study found that viewers who actively participate in text chat during live streams who form \"parasocial relationships\" with Twitch streamers are more likely to enjoy live streams (23) . Finally, an experiment found that when streamers reacted to messages from viewers and addressed viewers individually, viewers enjoyed the live stream more and became more committed to following social norms within the stream (24) . Yet, there is a lack of empirical work directly evaluating live streams' impacts on loneliness or other aspects of user wellbeing.",

The product is called \"Online Experiences\" and was developed to simulate elements of local tourism through interactive virtual walking tours (led and designed by local tour guides), cooking shows, and science lessons from around the world (25) . It builds from established online formats, such as Webinars (26) or live streams such as Twitch or YouTube Live (27) , but was designed to promote deeper levels of social interactivity and connection. To promote this interactivity, these sessions impose a limited group size (28) and emphasize webcam interactions between audience members and the presenters (29) .

We first excluded data from 198 of these 493 surveys because their Post-session survey measures were completed before the presentation was completed. Next, we excluded data from 42 surveys because of failure to provide the correct response to either of the two attention check questions. Finally, we dropped 4 surveys from respondents who had already taken the survey. This produced a final dataset of 249 participants who finished the entire initial survey and passed attention checks. Of these 249 participants, 199 also completed the 4-week follow-up survey. All of the presentation sessions fell within the required bounds of 6-12 participants, so all 30 sessions were included in the analyses.",

We do not wish to suggest that a single 60-min presentation with interactive social elements is a sufficient loneliness intervention, as evidenced by the lack of a change in trait loneliness 4 weeks after the presentation. However, our evidence does show significant short-term improvements in several loneliness-related outcomes resulting from a socially interactive live video experience. Future work can explore how the short-term boost in affect and prosocial cognitions we demonstrated might translate into longer-term cognitive or behavioral changes. For example, these short interactive experiences could provide a spark of motivation to help people overcome attitudinal barriers to seeking deeper and more frequent social interactions. Indeed, we observed that individuals in the experimental condition showed greater reductions in vigilance to social threat. An openness to engage socially might not lead to enduring effects on its own, but it could make an individual more amenable to social interaction, should the opportunity present itself, which could lead to more self-sustaining cycles of prosociality.",

Furthermore, participants in our study had no Pre-existing relationships or expectation of future interaction with the other people in their presentation groups.

Our results may also suggest that internetsupported social experiences can supplement more formal loneliness interventions; such experiences could provide lowcost, convenient, and relatively Non-threatening opportunities for individuals to challenge their maladaptive social cognitions and improve their social skills (11, 45) .

This distinction is important because while chronic loneliness is a significant risk factor, transitory loneliness may be adaptive. Second, our single-item state loneliness and social threat measures were not validated and were highly skewed in our sample such that most of our sample did not report struggling with loneliness. This reduced the power of our analyses and impaired our ability to generalize our findings to more lonely populations. Future work should recruit samples who struggle with loneliness to overcome this issue. Third, our use of an online recruitment platform creates some sampling bias; for example, users of these platforms may misreport their age or other characteristics. Sampling bias may have been particularly severe for us because we collected data during a period when the survey platform, Prolific, received a huge influx of new users who were young and mostly female due to a popular post about the platform on the social media site Tiktok (50) . Issues with the platform may have also led to a systematic imbalance between our control and experimental conditions. Fourth, our conclusions regarding the live video experience's impacts on loneliness-related outcomes are limited only to the period that we measured them, and there may have been other unintended downsides of participation that we did not think to measure. Finally, we operationalized social interactivity in this study as live video interactions between session participants and with the presenter, but there are many forms of social interactivity.
