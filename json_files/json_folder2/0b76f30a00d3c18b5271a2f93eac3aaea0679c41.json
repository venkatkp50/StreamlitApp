In fact, more than 5 million people had died of COVID-19 by the end of fall in 2021 alone. This previously unknown disease attracted special attention since in 10-15% patients it provoked severe pneumonia accompanied with a high-grade fever, severe dry cough, and dyspnea [1] .",

These endothelial lesions lead to coagulopathy [4] and the development of systemic vasculitis and thrombosis, which disturb the normal blood supply to the organs and finally result in the development of multi-organ failure [5, 6] . It is generally accepted that these pathologies are underlain by the progression of coagulopathy and endotheliitis. Indeed, endothelial damage is the key factor associated with the devastating effect of COVID-19 on the functions of various organs. Consequently, an effective treatment strategy for COVID-19 should not only involve directly annihilating the virus or suppressing its replication, but also protect the vascular endothelium.",

Sulodexide has also been shown to restore endothelium integrity after lesions [8] .

Additional details of this method have been previously described elsewhere [13] . A quarter of the filter was cut out, and it contained the cells sedimented from a 5 \u00b5L blood specimen. Through consecutive scanning of the entire surface of this quarter of the filter, we counted the total number of circulating endothelial cells (CEC), which then was recalculated for 1 mL blood. All the blood cells (erythrocytes and their sludges, platelets, leucocytes) and their aggregates were investigated in the same specimens. All these cells were counted on 25 squares sizing 10 \u00d7 10 \u00b5m and placed diagonally. The data are summarized as the mean obtained in 10 scan fields.

This reasoning suggests a mechanism for the spread of this infection in humans. After entering the alveoli through airways, the coronavirus damages them and disrupts the integrity of the alveolar-capillary barrier. The virus subsequently invades the pulmonary circulation and travels with the blood to all organs, where it binds with and penetrates the endothelial cells. After replication in endothelial cells, SARS-CoV-2 kills the host cell. Thereafter, the damaged endothelial cells detach from the vascular wall, thereby denuding the thrombogenic and proinflammatory subendothelial surface, which in its turn results in the development of coagulopathy, perivascular inflammation, tissue edema, and a procoagulant state.",

In fact, the quantity of CEC in the sulodexide group decreased by 40% after 10 days of treatment, in contrast to control group, in which no such effect was observed (Figure 1 ). Taking into consideration that the quantity of CEC can serve as a marker and a quantitative measure of endothelial damage, the present data demonstrated that sulodexide could protect endothelial cells against viral aggression. By decreasing the degree of vascular denudation, sulodexide should ipso facto diminish the area of the denuded surface of the vessels, which consequently should ameliorate inflammation. In turn, the inhibition of vascular inflammation should limit the disturbances in the structure of the blood (Figure 2 ). In fact, after a 10-day treatment, the score of erythrocytic sludges in experimental group dropped almost three-fold, while in the control group, it remained virtually unchanged. Remembering that erythrocytic coin-roll formations impede normal blood supply because they cannot travel through the capillaries and secure adequate gas exchange in the tissues, one can conclude that sulodexide can normalize or at least pronouncedly improve blood supply to the organs, thereby diminishing the degree of tissue hypoxia.",

It should be stressed that we started to use sulodexide in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 rather late. The reason was that these patients arrived to the hospital as late as 5.9 \u00b1 0.8 days after manifestation of the first symptoms of the disease. This is a sufficiently long time for the virus to provoke marked inflammation in the vascular wall and coagulopathy. It is possible that, if we used sulodexide earlier, its effect could have been more pronounced.",
