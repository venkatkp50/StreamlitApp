SARS-CoV-2 is a highly transmissible virus that is primarily spread through airborne droplets when infected individuals congregate with others in enclosed spaces (Morawska and Milton, 2020) . The outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in Norway led to a national lockdown starting on March 12th, 2020. The lockdown included among others closing of all fitness centers, organized sports and sports events, and the whole community was advised to keep a social distance of two meters (The Norwegian Directorate of Health, 2020). Such intervening specifically affected those employed within the private and/or civil sector (e.g., freelancers, self-employed persons, parttime staff within culture, sport and fitness), and many suddenly found themselves without jobs and reduced income. The first 2 weeks of lockdown were followed by a gradual re-opening of the community in prioritized order. Operators within the health sector were specifically prioritized, and authorized health personnel such as physiotherapists and wellness actors such as massage therapists could reopen their practices from April 27th 2020. Schools reopened on May 11th 2020, organized youth-sports carefully returned toward normal operation from June 1st 2020; while fitness facilities were hold on wait until June 15 th 2020. For the occupational group of personal trainers (PT), no specific recommendations concerning return to work and reopening of practice were made besides the opening of fitness facilities.",

Yet, there is limited knowledge about this profession and their working conditions. There is no requirement of formal accreditation to work as a PT, and a report from 2016 showed that 84% of the Norwegian PTs lack a formal university degree in exercise science (Virke Trening, 2016) . Malek et al. (2002) showed that formal education in exercise science, and not years of work experience, predicted the PTs' knowledge about nutrition, health screening, testing, exercise prescription, and clinical exercise physiology. Norway also lacks a formal accreditation of clinical exercise physiologists such as seen in e.g., Australia (Cheema et al., 2014; Soan et al., 2014; Lederman et al., 2016) , and PTs with and without such exercise-specific higher education are thus given the same rights, privileges and responsibilities when performing their profession. Although the fitness industry has been mentioned as an important partner for physical activity, and hence public health, in white papers and global actions for physical activity by the World Health Organization (WHO, 2018) and by the Norwegian government (Departementene, 2020) , little has been done to formally develop this partnership by the authorities. This lack of formal partnership might be viewed in light of poor reputation of the fitness center industry in Norway, mainly due to the impression of the industry's focus on cosmetics/aesthetics, body and appearance (Klepaker and Nor\u00f8y, 2019) . The prolonged lockdown of the industry was also maintained despite attempts from the fitness industry trade organization Virke trening to develop standards and guidelines for infection control within fitness centers (Kristiansen, 2020a) . The industry thus questioned the late opening of the fitness centers, in addition to the lack of any concrete guidelines addressing PTs during the lock-down reopening phase, yet no empirical data exists on how the PTs experienced this lack of concrete guidelines.",

Women show higher sick leave rates compared to men (Barmby et al., 2002) , and numbers from Swedish statistics (Angelov et al., 2013) showed that sickness absence in women were between 0.5 and 0.85 days per month higher than in men when entering parenthood. The most plausible explanation for this difference is the inequality in family responsibilities between men and women (Angelov et al., 2013) . Studies on other occupations, such as teachers, also report poorer health and well-being, higher job stress and lower job satisfaction among females compared to males (Klassen and Chiu, 2010) . Due to the aforementioned scarce knowledge about PTs' working status and pattern, potential gender issues and perspectives are important to examine.",

It affects societies, economies, spread fear, and hence potentially impairs lifestyle behavior and increase mental health challenges (Carbone, 2020) . Impacts such as loss of income, the experience of not being evaluated as adequately important to reopen business, and the isolation from social interaction may have profound effects on health (Holmes et al., 2020) . Besides grief, stress, anxiety and depression; changes in lifestyle behavior such as sleep, eating and physical activity may also cause somatic health impairment (Woods et al., 2020) .

Asking open-ended questions may elicit surprising answers, new ideas, and unexpected experiences. Often such freely formulated answers are raw, unfiltered, and emotional. Many of them give colors to their experiences, as well as providing a deeper insight to the predefined questions they have just answered. These qualities were likely to be lost if we coded the answers according to our interpretations. In other words, we gave the respondents a voice beyond the statistics. In the following, the data from the openended questions are presented as an elaboration of the responses to the close-ended questions. However, not every respondent filled out the space in the open-ended questions. We therefore indicate how many respondents who used this option when presenting the open answers.

Simultaneously, there was an increase in use of online and/or outdoor training during the lockdown especially among the male respondents. Also, more males than females reported use of the lockdown period to study and/or follow courses. These gender differences can be compared to what have been reported in academia during the lockdown; finding fewer paper submissions and projects initiations among females compared to male researchers (Viglione, 2020) .",

Family obligations have also been identified as the most plausible explanation for gender differences in sick absence from work in Swedish employees. We did not collect data on the respondents' family situation, and can therefore only speculate that inequality in family obligations might explain the detected gender differences. Future studies should test this hypothesis thoroughly. A second hypothesis for the observed gender differences has to do with masculinity and health information behavior (Courtenay, 2000; Ek, 2015) . Previous studies show that men take less precaution and they care less about health information and behavior, and perhaps this form of masculinity became prominent with the pandemic and the lockdown. This can thus explain why the males kept the PT business going to a greater extend that the females.",

One potential explanation might be that vitality is a unidimensional, dynamic construct of well-being sensitive to changes in e.g., life events (Ryan and Frederick, 1997) , hence we cannot exclude the possibility that the retrospective \"before Covid-19 lockdown period\" has a limited validity in this sample due to completion of the instrument during the difficult times of the lockdown.

The lack of union organization and lack of formal licensing with protection of the title \"PT\" have emerged specifically disadvantageous in a situation like the Covid-19. Our findings points toward frustration and a feeling of conflict as they identified themselves as public health providers, but were imposed restrictions and rules, which were difficult to interpret. Not being directly addressed in the official regulations during Covid-19, resulted in different interpretations of work opportunities among the PTs. The commentaries given in the open-ended questions in this survey, revealed a diversity in temporarily solutions among PTs. Many waited for the fitness facility to reopen, still others identified their service either in line with other health professionals or with organized sports and started private services when these were allowed to reopen their practices. Some PTs even found their operative activity reasonable as long as they adhered to the public regulations (i.e., operating in small groups, keeping a social distancing of 2 meters) (Bugge, 2020) . This diversity in interpretation resulted in an impression that some PTs were not being loyal to the guidelines, which can be a source for conflict. What seems to be the core of the difference in interpretation of the guidelines is the outdoor training. This potential discord and conflict among the PTs could have been solved by more explicit guidelines for organized outdoor training from the government. As mentioned in the Introduction, Virke trening provided several attempts to develop such guidelines and have these reviewed and approved by the government (Kristiansen, 2020a ), yet the Norwegian health authorities were reluctant to do so. One reason for why the authorities overlooked the PTs in their specific guidelines and priorities when reopening the community, may be a reputational history of the fitness industry as a body appearance focused arena, with less health related motivation (Klepaker and Nor\u00f8y, 2019; Kristiansen, 2020b) . Hence, when health authorities prioritized the first services to reopen, the PTs and fitness industry was not considered sufficiently important prior to other health and wellness services. Other than being overlooked as a health promoting service, the activities typically associated with the fitness industry could also cause concerns about infection control. One suggested explanation for the reluctance to reopen the fitness center facilities by the government was that the typical fitness center activities takes place inside crowded facilities using shared equipment, and that services by PTs are associated to these arenas (Kristiansen, 2020b) . Previous studies have also shown poor sanitation of surfaces in fitness centers (Mukherjee et al., 2014; Maurice Bilung et al., 2018) , and it is plausible to believe that the decision-makers therefore were unsure about the industry's ability to adhere to strict guidelines and regimes for sanitation during a pandemic.",

Given the popularity of outdoor physical activities in Norway, and the image of Norwegians as an \"outdoor and hiking people\" (Gurholt and Broch, 2019) , this was a reasonable assumption. However, the decision-makers seem to have neglected the empirical knowledge that more than 30% of the Norwegian population exercise regularly in fitness centers (Breivik, 2013; Virke Trening, 2019) . Despite well-known social inequalities in health and physical activity level, outdoor life is the only arena for physical activity where the effect of social class seem to be negligible (Breivik, 2013) , and hence it can be argued that the highest social classes were most affected by the lockdown of the fitness centers. The picture is however more complex, as those in high social class are often more motivated to exercise by themselves and for health related reasons compared to the lower social classes (Breivik and Rafoss, 2017) . Some of the open-ended comments by the respondents also points to the social connection enabled by PTs in both individual and group exercise. The fitness centers' role in social life and how their lockdown for 13.5 weeks affected the clients' social network and isolation should therefore be examined thoroughly in future studies. Also, more knowledge is therefore needed on how social inequality in health and physical activity might have been impacted by the lockdown of fitness centers.",

We also find that the concerns about the loss of clients not necessarily was related to their own loss of income but also an expression of idealism, which is in line with a previous finding (Rahman and Wills, 2013) . The use of more or less free online and/or outdoor offers for the clients also add up to this interpretation.

They rate their own services as important public health work, and they find their profession needed also in the years to come. Perhaps the Covid-19 will affect the public health negatively both on short and long term, and such an effect will require much effort and collaboration between sectors and professions. Moving services into online platforms, outdoors, and development of new products provides other possibilities and potentially new groups of clients for the PTs. Although it was reported that moving services online during the lockdown generated little income, and actually provided economic loss for some PTs, this must be seen in relation to the rapid change of political responses to the pandemic and that the lockdown happened over night. Such digital services might have a potential for generating income when this can be planned and developed properly by the PTs. Nevertheless, the importance of social connection and meeting clients and colleagues face to face should also be addressed in future studies concerning PTs working conditions and occupational health. Our data show the genuine care and concern PTs show for their clients, and how this client/PT relationship can be kept and further developed is an area for future research.",

Such guidelines can be in accordance with the guidelines for other health and exercise professions. Also, the findings implicate the need for establishing a union organization for PTs, an organization that can take care of the needs of the PTs both toward their employers (i.e., large fitness center companies) and toward the government and health authorities. The findings, also documented in other studies, suggest a discussion of the PTs' educational level. Increased scientific knowledge, acquired through university degrees, may help the PTs to be more qualified and more accepted as health providers in the society. This will benefit the PTs, the industry and the society in general. In the aftermath of the pandemic, this should be a lesson learned, in this industry as well as in other industries within the field of culture.",

            "text": "First, two factors that has been found important in explaining gender differences in work life and health are differences in family obligation (Angelov et al., 2013) and masculinity in health behavior (Courtenay, 2000; Ek, 2015) . One important reason for the observed gender difference in Viglione (2020) was that female researchers to a greater extent than males had family obligations with home kindergarten and home school during the lockdown period. Family obligations have also been identified as the most plausible explanation for gender differences in sick absence from work in Swedish employees (Angelov et al., 2013) . We did not collect data on the respondents' family situation, and future studies therefore need to collect this information to explore potential family obligation inequality among PTs. The importance of masculinity in health behavior manifests with men taking less precaution and care less about health information and behavior (Courtenay, 2000; Ek, 2015) . Future studies should examine if this form of masculinity became more prominent with the pandemic and the lockdown, and if this can explain why males kept the PT business going to a greater extent than the females. Second, the low scores on vitality combined with the reported negative impact of the lockdown on the working conditions calls for more research on the PTs general health, including somatic, mental, social and occupational health. Their motivation for becoming PTs and how this motivation affects their job motivation and job satisfaction should also be addressed in future studies. This motivation is important to understand because it might relate to their health. For instance, previously published anecdotes describe PTs who chose this profession due to themselves being helped to e.g., recover from illness and/or injury, improve performance, or that they somehow discovered the greatness of physical activity and exercise and then want others to have the same positive experiences (Howliston, 2016; Green, 2018) . A study on health trainers' professional journey in UK (Rahman and Wills, 2013) showed that the health trainers were highly motivated by the value of \"giving back\" to their community, and this might also be an important motivation for PTs.",

The study is limited by the self-report, the cross-sectional and retrospective design, and the recruitment through social media. The SVS was completed twice in the survey, one with focus on vitality prior to the lockdown and one version with focus on vitality during the lockdown. As they were completed during the same session, but with one version retrospectively, we must take into account that they might have over-evaluated how their vitality level was prior to the lockdown. Further, almost 30% of the respondents reported exercise-specific education from university/college on graduate or post-graduate level, this was higher than expected when comparing to a survey about the formal exercise-specific competence of PTs from 2016 (Virke Trening, 2016) . Hence, the results may not be generalizable for the entire population of PTs. Although this survey has a quantitative approach, we allowed the respondents to comment to open-ended questions. These comments and answers were used as a supplement to elaborate on the quantitative findings, and they were voluntary to complete. Hence, not all responded to these open-ended questions and the content of the comments varied from one-word phrases to longer narratives. We acknowledge that this limits the possibility for a deeper and more qualitative understanding of the PTs experiences and perspectives.",
