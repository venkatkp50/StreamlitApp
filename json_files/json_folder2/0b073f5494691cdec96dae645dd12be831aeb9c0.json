            "text": "Background: In early 2020, Sars-Cov-2 was identified in China as a new coronavirus. Due to its transmission, Sars-Cov-2 has spread rapidly across the world. In the early stage of the disease outbreak, psychiatric symptoms have been reported, including depressive symptoms. In this study, we assessed the prevalence of depressive symptoms in quarantine and its association with sociodemographic variables and known protective factors for depression, such as spirituality, social support, resilience, and quality of life. Methods: A cross-sectional web-based questionnaire was distributed via social media. The instruments consisted of the 8-item EUROHIS-QOL, PHQ-9, Social Support Questionnaire, WHOQoL-SRPB, and CD-RISC. Results: A total of 3,274 participants were included in this study. 23.67% of the participants met the criteria for a depressive episode. Higher age, spirituality, social support, resiliency, and quality of life were associated with less depressive symptoms. Quarantine length; mental health treatment; chronic disease; age; sex; lower levels of spirituality, social support, resilience, quality of life, physical exercise, and education; and unpaid occupation were found to be predictors of depressive symptoms during COVID-19 quarantine. Limitations: The data are limited to the pandemic initial period, the sample isn't random and the use of selfreported questionnaires are some limitations of our study. Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in Brazil, quarantine time, treatment for mental health, chronic illness, lower levels of education, and unpaid occupation were positively associated with depressive symptoms. Age, sex, spirituality, social support, resilience, quality of life, and physical exercise showed a negative relationship with depressive symptoms.",

            "text": "In December 2019, increasing pneumonia cases of unknown etiology were reported in Wuhan, which is the largest city in Central China The Lancet, 2020) . In early January 2020, a new coronavirus was identified as the cause of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid among patients in China (Roujian Lu*, Xiang Zhao*, Juan Li*, Peihua Niu*, Bo Yang*, Honglong Wu*, Wenling Wang, Hao Song, Baoying Huang, Na Zhu, Yuhai Bi, Xuejun Ma, Faxian Zhan, Liang Wang, Tao Hu, Hong Zhou, Zhenhong Hu, Weimin Zhou, Li Zhao, Jing Chen, Yao Meng, Ji Wang, Yang, Lu* et al., 2020) . Due to its person-to-person transmission, COVID-19 has spread rapidly across the world (Rothe et al., 2020) . This situation has become a public health emergency of international interest and has required rapid, high-level, and coordinated effort to control the outbreak (Cucinotta and Vanelli, 2020) . A significant number of deaths have been reported on all continents in this pandemic. In Brazil, the first case was confirmed on February 26, 2020, in S\u00e3o Paulo (SP). The first death from COVID-19 was recorded on March 17, 2020 (Brazil, 2020) . In view of this scenario, social isolation measures were necessary to decrease the COVID-19 transmission worldwide and Brazil. Isolation and quarantine are used to contain or minimize infectious disease outbreaks (Chuanyuan Kanga, Fu Menga, Qiang Fenga, Jing Yuanb, Liang Liuc, LiaXub, Shuran Yanga, Yujun Weib, Xudong Zhaoa, Jianzhong Yangb, Kanga et al., 2020) . Isolation involves the separation people who are infected with a contagious disease from those who are not sick. Quarantine involves the separation and restriction of movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease during the incubation period to see if they become sick (Giubilini et al., 2018) . This restriction involves the confinement of individuals who may not be infected and forces people who have not been infected to be spatially close to those who have actually been infected. Social isolation might be mandated for people who have been exposed to a disease and refuse compulsory medical treatment (Lacey, 2003) , as well as when such treatment is not available. Often, these restrictions involve not only physical confinement, but also emotional, spiritual, and cognitive isolation due to limitations in interactions with health workers, relatives, religious leaders, and others (Giubilini et al., 2018) . A study using a web-based approach conducted in Vietnam in the second week of April 2020 to examine the influence of national social distance on quality of life and economic well-being showed that most individuals had lost family income, who were female, who had a chronic conditions and who were living in a family with 3 to 5 members were associated with worse quality of life under COVID-19 pandemic .",

A study conducted in Southeastern China in February 2020 showed that the prevalence of depression was approximately 14.6% among 1,593 participants, and the prevalence in the group affected by quarantine was significantly higher than in the unaffected group (Lei et al., 2020) . In Italy, an online survey was administered in March 2020 to 2,766 participants, of which 15.8% scored very high on the DASS-21 depression subscale. This study also showed that lower levels of education, female sex, unemployment, not having a child, having a family member infected with COVID-19, and a history of stressful situations and medical problems were associated with higher levels of depression (Mazza et al., 2020) . A systematic review including 19 studies was carried out in order to synthesize the results of the effects of COVID-19 on the psychological health of the population of some countries (China, Spain, Italy, Iran, the United States, Turkey, Nepal and Denmark) and its risk factors associated. In this study, relatively high rates of symptoms of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, psychological distress and stress were found. Female gender, younger age group, presence of chronic and psychiatric diseases, unemployment, student status and frequent exposure to social media and news about COVID-19 are the factors associated with measures of suffering. In Brazil, until now, this situation has not been well studied (Xiong et al., 2020) .",

Therefore, it was not possible to conduct a prospective study with the same participants and schedule an intervention focused on public mental health. There was an over-sampling of health professionals and post-graduates, leading to selection bias. As a result, the conclusions are less generalizable to the entire population, especially for the less educated. Another limitation is that self-reported levels of psychological impact cannot always be aligned with assessments by mental health professionals. Likewise, respondents may have provided socially desirable responses in terms of satisfaction with the health information received and precautionary measures. Furthermore, several publications from around the world recommend that governments provide clear and impartial information with the aim of lessening the impact on the population's mental health during the period of social isolation. However, Brazil is experiencing a political crisis in addition to the health crisis created by pandemic. Hence, other non-measured variables related to quarantine, such as local policy, could have contributed to worse effects on mental health, in addition to the effects of the pandemic. Future studies could better elucidate this issue.",

Our results could be used as a historical reference since the pandemic will last much longer than initially presumed, and mental health problems probably will persist even after its complete control. Most importantly, our findings could directly inform the development of psychological interventions that could minimize depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak and provide a baseline for assessing prevention, control, and treatment efforts during the remainder of the epidemic, which was still in progress at the time of preparing this article.",

Quarantine longer than 30 days, female sex, young age, and chronic diseases were associated with depressive symptoms. Spirituality, social support, resilience, quality of life, and physical exercise were protective against depressive symptoms during this period. In addition, we found that quarantine had a major impact on depressive symptoms among people with a lower level of education and on individuals with an unpaid occupation. Our findings could be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve mental health during the COVID-19 epidemic.",
