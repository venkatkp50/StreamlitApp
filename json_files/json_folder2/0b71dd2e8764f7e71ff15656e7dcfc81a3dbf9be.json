A waste container (i.e., small biohazard bag or pipette tray) should be placed inside the cabinet, so that personnel do not have to remove waste frequently while working. At the end of the work session all the supplies that have been used inside the cabinet should be disinfected before being removed from the hood. The interior walls of the cabinet should be disinfected too. We recommend using 10% bleach, followed by 70% ethanol (Fisher Scientific) to disinfect suppliers and surfaces. 3) Centrifuge: the centrifuge inside the BSL-2+ facility should be cleaned and disinfected with 10% bleach followed by 70% ethanol after the work session has ended. 4) Waste disposal: Liquid waste: all liquid waste generated during the work session should be immediately decontaminated by mixing with 10% bleach for at least 30 minutes. The solution is then disposed of in the sink, which should be washed and decontaminated thereafter. Solid waste: the solid waste generated during a work session (i.e., pipettes, vials, tubes, tips) must be placed into a beaker containing 10% bleach and left soak for at least 15 minutes before being removed from the hood. Decontaminated waste and used gloves should be collected in a small biohazard bag inside the biosafety cabinet and then disposed of in a larger biohazard bag outside the cabinet when the work is completed.",

Reportedly, DV200 < 30% are considered being degraded for further experiments (Wimmer et al., 2018) ; values of DV200 between 50% and 70% are of acceptable quality but might require higher input volumes for transcriptome analysis (Wimmer et al., 2018) . DV200 values higher than 70% are usually associated with high RNA quality (Wimmer et al., 2018) . Based on this evidence, we recommend using samples with DV200 higher than 70% to maximize the chances of success in the NanoString assay.

In the case of PBMCs, fresh or recently collected samples are preferable to maximize the chances of obtaining higher RNA concentrations. Selection of RNA samples with DV200 higher than 70% at the bioanalyzer further enhances the chances of a successful run. By applying these parameters, we were able to show significant differences in gene metabolism, TCR repertoires and ENTPD1/CD39 (Savio et al., 2020 , Wang et al., 2021 levels between COVID-19 impacted organs and non-COVID-19 controls (Wang et al., 2021) . When considering PBMCs, we noted that samples obtained from severe COVID-19 patients displayed limited TCR repertoires and lower ENTPD1/CD39 levels compared to moderate COVID-19 patients, convalescents and healthy controls (Wang et al., 2021) . Importantly, NanoString data were validated using other approaches, namely flow cytometry, qPCR and immunohistochemistry (Wang et al., 2021) .",

As indicated in the original manuscript (Wang et al., 2021) , further analysis of normalized data, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and gene set scores, was conducted using R software (version 4.0.2). DEGs were defined based on P value \u2264 10 -4 when analyzing samples from organs; and P value \u2264 10 -3 when analyzing PBMC samples. Different thresholds were applied because we noted more substantial differences in the organs than PBMCs, between COVID-19 and control samples. False discovery rate was controlled by the Benjamini-Yekutieli method (Benjamini and Yekutieli, 2001) . When comparing mRNA levels in the organs of COVID-19 patients and controls, unpaired t test was used; when considering PBMCs, comparisons of mRNA levels between patients at different disease stage and controls were performed using one-way ANOVA test, followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test. P\u22640.05 was considered significant. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism, version 9.3.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).",

In this regard, the recent introduction of GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler has enabled whole transcriptome profiling at the single cell level in a spatial context, providing critical information about the expression of key targets specific to a certain tissue region (Delorey et al., 2021 , Kulasinghe et al., 2021 , Park et al., 2021 .
