This novel pathogen, an enveloped RNA beta-coronavirus, was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the disease caused by this virus was called coronavirus disease 2019 . The COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as a public health crisis of global proportions. 3 COVID-19 typically presents with respiratory tract symptoms including fever, dry cough, and dyspnea. The disease can progress to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. 4 The pathophysiology of COVID-19 infection is not clear. However, an extreme immune response and cytokine storm are thought to play pivotal roles in severe cases of the disease. 4 Our knowledge of the cardiovascular effects of COVID-19 is limited. Studies have reported that left and right ventricular ejection fraction may be reduced by a cytokine-mediated systemic response to infection through increases in the end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes of both ventricles. 5 However, it is not known whether left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic dysfunction develops in patients with COVID-19.",

The value of MPI in LV dysfunction has been confirmed in patients with symptomatic heart failure of non-ischemic or ischemic etiology and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. 17 Patients with heart failure are also prone to hemodynamic decompensation during the stress of severe infections. During most influenza outbreaks, more patients die of cardiovascular causes than from pneumonia. 24 COVID-19 causes myocardial inflammation and myocarditis. [25] [26] [27] The elevated cTnI in our patients might reflect myocardial damage. cTnI is part of the contractile apparatus in cardiomyocytes and is expressed only in the heart. 29 As a result of its organ specificity, cTnI can be used to diagnose cardiomyocyte damage. 29 The elevated LDH observed may reflect tissue damage and inflammation.",

O nosso objetivo foi avaliar o IPM em doentes com COVID-19. M\u00e9todos: O presente estudo consistiu em analisar 40 casos controlo saud\u00e1veis e 40 doentes com diagn\u00f3stico de COVID-19 que apresentavam pneumonia ligeira e n\u00e3o necessitavam de tratamento intensivo.

Primeiro, o IPM e os par\u00e2metros laboratoriais foram comparados entre os casos controlo saud\u00e1veis e os doentes com per\u00edodo agudo de infe\u00e7\u00e3o.

The exam was performed at the acute stage of infection and after clinical recovery in patients with COVID-19. The recovery echocardiography exam was performed on patients who were still hospitalized but had recovered both symptomatically and according to laboratory findings. The mean time between baseline and recovery echocardiography exams was 28\u00b13.4 days. Doppler and two-dimensional echocardiography were performed in standard views according to the guidelines of the American Society of Echocardiography. 7 The modified Simpson's method was used to calculate left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). 8 Apical 4-chamber views were obtained by positioning the sample volume between the tips of the mitral leaflets for pulsed wave Doppler recordings of mitral inflow velocities. Peak late (A) and early (E) transmitral filling velocities and the E/A ratio were measured as conventional Doppler indices. Isovolumic relaxation time (IRT) was defined as the time between closure of the aortic valve and opening of the mitral valve. Isovolumic contraction time (ICT) was defined as the time between closure of the mitral valve and opening of the aortic valve. Ejection time (ET) was defined as the time between aortic valve opening and closure on the LV outflow velocity profile. Pulsed wave tissue Doppler imaging was performed in apical 4-chamber view with a sample volume of 2 mm placed on the medial wall of the mitral annulus. Highfrequency signals were excluded by adjusting filter settings. Doppler ultrasound scanning intervals were measured from the mitral annular velocity intervals. MPI was calculated using the equation: MPI=(ICT+IRT)/ET, where IRT is isovolumic relaxation time, ICT is isovolumic contraction time, and",

            "text": ",18 We aimed to assess LV systolic and diastolic function in COVID-19 patients using MPI. In the present study, MPI was higher in the acute disease period in patients with COVID-19, but regressed significantly after clinical recovery. Previous reports showed that systolic function is affected in COVID-19 patients. However, there is limited information about LV diastolic function in these patients. Our study showed that not only systolic but also diastolic function may be impaired in COVID-19 patients. In other words, COVID-19 patients may develop subclinical diastolic impairment without systolic involvement.The pathophysiological and cardiovascular effects of COVID-19 are not clear. However, the disease is thought to be associated with an excessive immune response triggered by the virus. Studies have found J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f that COVID-19 patients have high levels of interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, interferon gamma, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, which probably leads to an activated type 1 helper T cell response.4 Studies of coronavirus and influenza outbreaks suggest that viral infections can trigger a systemic inflammatory response that causes acute coronary syndromes, arrhythmias, and heart failure.[20][21][22][23] Similarly, underlying cardiovascular disease may be exacerbated or new cardiac disease may be induced during COVID-19. Acute coronary events may be due to increased myocardial demand triggered by infections that accelerate myocardial damage or infarction. Alternatively, circulating cytokines released during severe systemic inflammatory stress may cause instability and rupture of atherosclerotic plaque.",
