Palliative care team consultation has been associated with a decreased incidence of CPR at the end of life in cancer patients 8 and in medical intensive care unit (ICU) patients, 9 and is also associated with increased incidence of implementation of comfort care measures in these patient groups 10 .

From March 31, 2020 to March 17 th , 2021, the registry included 29,768 patients with complete data, originating from 168 hospitals in 18 countries. The VIRUS COVID-19 registry study was reviewed by the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN)'s institutional review board (IRB) and was granted a waiver of need for patients' informed consents because of its observational chart review design and its de-identified neutralized database structure. The study is registered on Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04323787. Participating study sites additionally obtained site specific institutional review board (IRB) approvals and implemented data use agreements with the Mayo Clinic coordinating study site before data were collected. Each participating site enters de-identified data into the registry's centralized study database maintained at Mayo Clinic Rochester, MN. Study data were stored and managed using Research Electronic Data Capture System (REDCap) tools hosted at the Mayo Clinic.",

Patients admitted to hospitals which utilized co-ventilation (i.e., the practice of ventilating multiple patients using a single ventilator) were also excluded as per the criteria of insufficient ventilator availability.

While most physicians are well equipped to discuss life-sustaining treatments for critical illnesses, alternatives to these treatments, including comfort-oriented options, are less frequently discussed 25 . Palliative care physicians are trained to ascertain the patient's goals and create a comfort care plan that align these goals with the expected prognosis and treatments that are provided. A comfort care plan is individualized to each patient and may include a time-limited trial of medical treatments or may focus entirely on the alleviation of distressing symptoms.

The data available in the registry was collected in real time throughout the pandemic, contributing to its credibility. Our large sample size allowed us to exclude patients who had a do-not-resuscitate code status at the time of hospital admission as well as those who died within 24 hours of hospital admission. The latter criteria were used because we wanted to ensure that our included patients had a reasonable chance of receiving a palliative care consultation after hospital admission. Because the VIRUS COVID-19 registry captured detailed information on resource shortages which were common during the pandemic, we were able to exclude patients admitted to hospitals while they were experiencing shortages in beds, PPE, medical personnel, or ventilators. This is because ethical guidelines published during the pandemic recommended that resource constraints should be taken into consideration when discussing EOL decisions with patients and against the provision of CPR when PPE, ventilators, and critical care beds are unavailable 35, 36 .",

Data regarding whether patients received palliative care consultation and data for the study's outcomes of whether CPR was performed and whether comfort care was provided was only collected for patients who died during primary hospitalization. As a result, we could not evaluate the impact of palliative care consultation on patients who were discharged alive from the hospital and received palliative therapies at home, such as home hospice. The registry also did not collect information on whether patients were discharged to in-patient hospice. Because the registry did not prioritize the collection of the timing of palliative care consultation, we were unable to analyze the impact of palliative care timing and frequency on our outcomes of interest. Another limitation of our study was that the comfort care outcome was not explicitly defined by the registry and left to the interpretation of the clinical site providing the data. This is particularly important because there are no universally accepted definitions for the provision of comfort care.",
