A tempestade de citocinas \u00e9 uma importante causa de morbilidade e mortalidade na doen\u00e7a coronav\u00edrus 2019 (COVID-19). Objetivos: Investigar a associa\u00e7\u00e3o entre volume adiposo epic\u00e1rdico (VAE), biomarcadores inflamat\u00f3rios e gravidade cl\u00ednica da COVID-19. M\u00e9todos: Este estudo retrospetivo incluiu 101 doentes infetados com COVID-19. Foram avaliados biomarcadores inflamat\u00f3rios s\u00e9ricos, incluindo os n\u00edveis de prote\u00edna C-reativa (PCR), de interleucina-6 (IL-6), de procalcitonina (PCT) e de ferritina. Foram analisadas imagens de tomografia computorizada (TC) e foram obtidas medi\u00e7\u00f5es semi-autom\u00e1ticas do VAE. O endpoint prim\u00e1rio composto foi a admiss\u00e3o na unidade de cuidados intensivos (UCI) ou morte. Resultados: O endpoint prim\u00e1rio ocorreu em 25,1% (n = 26) dos doentes (idade m\u00e9dia 64,8\u00b114,8 anos, 14 homens). Um total de 10 doentes morreu. Os n\u00edveis de VAE, PCR, PCT, ferritina e IL-6 foram significativamente superiores nos doentes internados na UCI. Al\u00e9m disso, verificou-se uma correla\u00e7\u00e3o positiva entre o VAE e a PCR (r: 0,494, p < 0,001), PCT (r: 0,287, p = 0,005), ferritina (r: 0,265, p = 0,01) e IL-6 (r: 0,311, p= 0,005). Na an\u00e1lise de regress\u00e3o logistica multivariada, os doentes com VAE > 102 cm3 tinham maior probabilidade de ter complica\u00e7\u00f5es graves. Conclus\u00e3o: O VAE e os n\u00edveis s\u00e9ricos de PCR, IL-6, PCT e ferritina podem avaliar a gravidade da doen\u00e7a e prever o resultado em doentes com COVID-19. O VAE constitui um fator preditivo na admiss\u00e3o dos doentes hospitalizados com COVID-19 numa UCI.",

            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) is an ongoing pandemic that has already affected millions of people worldwide and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and first occurred in Wuhan in December 2019. 1 On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and on March 11 declared it a pandemic. As of May 6, a total of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Early reports from China and Italy indicate that SARS-CoV-2 causes illness of varying degrees of severity. 2, 3 It has a wide clinical spectrum, including asymptomatic infection, mild respiratory disease, severe pneumonia with acute respiratory failure and even death. An excessive inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be one of the major causes of disease severity and death in patients with Evidence suggests that cytokine release syndrome (CRS) can play a major role in severe COVID-19. 5 Inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2), induced protein 10 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) are significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients, and some were more commonly seen in severe than in nonsevere patients. 5 Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is a fat storage tissue located beneath the pericardium, representing approximately 15% of the cardiac weight. 6, 7 It is a visceral fat that secretes inflammatory cytokines and mediators like MCP-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1). 8 It can be measured with different imaging techniques: transthoracic echocardiography, multislice computed tomography (MSCT) and magnetic resonance imaging. 9, 10 Computed tomography (CT) is a reliable and reproducible method for quantification of epicardial fat volume (EFV) independent of cardiac cycle phase. 11, 12 Chest CT is a cornerstone in the assessment of patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Among recent developments in noninvasive imaging methods, non-gated chest CT was shown to correlate with values measured by coronary CT angiography. 2, 13 C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), ferritin and IL-6 are known inflammatory biomarkers and their levels have previously been reported to correlate with disease severity in COVID-19 patients. 14, 15 However, there are no data about the association between EFV and disease severity, nor on the correlation with these inflammatory biomarkers. Recently, Zhao emphasized the role of epicardial fat in overweight patients, who have worse prognosis during COVID-19 infection. 16 Early diagnosis of serious illness is critical to early classification and improvement of patients' prognosis. Additionally, the early identification of patients who will become severely ill could facilitate the allocation of limited medical resources to patients in need of aggressive treatment. Therefore, further research is urgently needed on early diagnosis and prognosis. In this paper, we aimed to assess the association between EFV (measured by a 128-slice MSCT scanner), inflammatory biomarkers and prognosis of COVID-19 patients.",

Severe and critical patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), whereas patients in the mild to moderate group were admitted to the ward. 18 A combination of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), azitromycin and favipiravir was used for the treatment of severe COVID-19 cases, whereas only HCQ was used for mild to moderate cases.

However, many changes occur as EAT volumes increase. These changes are often characterized by hypertrophy, failure to store triglycerides, increased lipolysis and inflammation. 21 As EAT expands, it becomes hypoxic and dysfunctional and is invaded by increasing numbers of macrophages and T lymphocytes, resulting in a shift in its metabolic profile. 22 The result is increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, MCP-1 and many others that contribute to the inflammatory environment. 8 In this setting, the beneficial paracrine effects of EAT are lost. Shimabukuro et al. showed that EFV was positively correlated with the expression of inflammatory cytokines in EAT, but was negatively correlated with adiponectin expression. 23 Malavazos et al. studied the association between EAT thickness and plasma cytokine levels in severe patients with obesity.

It is a systemic inflammatory response that can be caused by infectious diseases, certain drugs and other factors, and is characterized by a sharp increase in the level of several proinflammatory cytokines. 30-32 SARS-CoV-2 binds to alveolar epithelial cells, activates the innate and adaptive immune systems and thus leads to the release of large quantities of cytokines, including IL-6, which is the key molecule involved in CRS. IL-6 is an important member of the cytokine network and plays a central role in acute inflammation.33 It has both anti-inflammatory and proinflammatory effects.Liu et al. showed an increase in inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, IL-2 and interferon gamma) in the peripheral blood in severe COVID-19 cases.34 Zhang et al. also found a relationship between higher IL-6",

Liu et al. 44 recently studied PCT, CRP and IL-6 levels in COVID-19 patients, dividing them into two groups: with severe disease or with mild disease. They found significantly higher PCT, CRP and IL-6 levels in the severe group compared to the mild group. In addition, they identified all of these inflammatory biomarkers as independent factors predicting the severity of COVID-19. Our results also demonstrated higher levels of admission PCT, CRP and IL-6 levels in severe COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, we showed a positive correlation between these inflammatory biomarkers and EFV. Serum ferritin can be elevated during infection and inflammation. High ferritin levels due to secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and CRS have been reported in severe COVID-19 patients. Velavan et al. recommended the use of serum ferritin, CRP and IL-6 levels in risk stratification of COVID-19",
