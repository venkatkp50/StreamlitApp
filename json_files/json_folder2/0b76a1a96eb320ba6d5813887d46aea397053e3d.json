            "text": "Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal mortality worldwide and can lead to several adverse maternal and newborn health effects. The preterm, prelabor rupture of membrane (pPROM) leads to 30% to 40% of preterm births worldwide and is defined as a rupture of the water pocket-called the fetal membrane (FM)-prior to 37 weeks of pregnancy [1] . FMs comprise two layers-the amnion and chorion-that are connected by a collagen-rich extracellular matrix, thus establishing a real interface between the mother and her future newborn [2] . FM rupture is a consequence of biochemical and histological changes during pregnancy [3, 4] . These modifications mainly contribute to the formation of a weak zone called the zone of altered morphology (ZAM) at the cervix (site of rupture), which is characterized by a significant reduction in FM thickness [2] . This weakening is induced by the combination of exacerbated and programmed molecular and cellular events such as oxidative stress, apoptosis, senescence, extracellular matrix degradation, and, especially, sterile inflammation [5] . The level of proinflammatory proteins and cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF\u03b1 increases in the amniotic fluid near term and is exacerbated in the case of pPROM [6, 7] , underlying that this phenomenon is important in the FMs' physiological and pathological weakening.",

            "text": "The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that binds with the peroxisome proliferator response element (PPRE) to regulate the transcription of the target genes involved in lipid metabolism, embryonic development, and inflammation, which is one of the key phenomena for FM rupture [8, 9] . There are three isoforms for PPAR receptors-PPAR\u03b1, \u03b2/\u03b4, and \u03b3-and each has its cell and tissue expression patterns and specificity of molecular and cellular action. Lappas et al. demonstrated that PPAR\u03b3 can reduce the production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, and TNF\u03b1) induced by lipopolysaccharide in FMs and the placenta when the receptor is activated by its ligand: thiazolidinedione [10] . Due to its properties, this receptor may be an essential factor in the regulation of inflammation in FMs during pregnancy and can be involved in the dysregulation of this phenomenon near term.",

            "text": "The esters of phthalic acid, also known as phthalates, are synthetic chemical compounds that are widely used as plasticizers in numerous products, including polyvinyl chloride (materials, food packaging, cosmetics, and medical devices) [11] . Among them, di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) is the most present in the environment because of its large and widespread use in industry [12] . Therefore, the general population is exposed daily to these substances through oral exposure because of the consumption of contaminated food and water, skin contamination, and intravenous exposure from medical drugs or blood transfusion equipment [13, 14] . Numerous studies have investigated the toxic effects of phthalates on health, and it has been established that these compounds can lead to serious adverse effects, such as testicular steroidogenesis disruption, low sperm quality, endometrioses, and infertility [15] . Recent public health studies have established the presence of phthalates and their metabolites in several pregnant women's physiological samples (placental tissues, cord blood, and amniotic fluid) [16] , underlining the fact that the amnion, which is physiologically involved in term rupture, is in direct contact with phthalates and their metabolites throughout pregnancy. Furthermore, it has been established that exposure to these molecules is associated with premature birth [13] , a decrease in gestational age [17] , miscarriage [18] , placental pathologies such as in utero growth restriction (IUGR) [19] , and FM pathologies such as pPROM [13] . Because of a physical interaction, several phthalates such as mono(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (MEHP), which is the active metabolite of DEHP, can act as ligands for intracellular receptors, such as estrogen, androgen receptors, and PPAR\u03b3 [15] , modifying their pathway and action. Recently, it has been established that in the placental area, dysregulation of the PPAR\u03b3 receptor pathway by MEHP results in an inhibition of trophoblast differentiation, which leads to placental pathologies such as pre-eclampsia and preterm birth [8] . The authors demonstrated that MEHP could interfere with the docking of a specific ligand (rosiglitazone) to PPAR\u03b3, leading to a decrease in PPAR\u03b3 transcriptional activity. Concerning the pathologies of FMs, the link between phthalates, PPAR\u03b3, and pPROM has not yet been clearly established; thus, this constitutes the object of the current research project.",

For the cells, RNA extraction was performed with NucleoSpin RNA (740955.50, Macherey-Nagel, Hoerdt, France), following the manufacturer's instructions. Retrotranscription of RNA extracted in cDNA was made from 1 \u00b5g of total RNA using the SuperScript IV First-Strand Synthesis System for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), according to the manufacturer's protocol. After this step, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiments were performed using oligonucleotides for PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b2, and PPAR\u03b3 ( Table 1) . The results were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel.

Treatment by rosiglitazone for 24 h decreased RNA expressions of IL-6 (p = 0.0125) and IL-8 (p = 0.0073) in LPS-treated FMs, confirming the anti-inflammatory properties of PPAR\u03b3, whereas treatment with GW9662 alone ( Figure 5A ) or MEHP alone (data not shown) in these membranes had no direct effect on cytokine expression. MEHP at 100 \u00b5M removed an agonist-induced decrease for both cytokines studied, and the concentration of MEHP at 10 \u00b5M only decreased IL-8 expression.

            "text": "Although phthalates are known to be reprotoxic and their presence has been identified in the urine of pregnant women, few studies have evaluated the effects of these compounds in pregnant women. Nevertheless, it has been shown that phthalates can cross the placental barrier and FMs, because their presence has been observed in placental tissues, the umbilical cord, and amniotic fluid [21] [22] [23] . However, some recent works have observed a link between phthalate exposure and the occurrence of obstetrical pathologies, whether of placental origin, such as IUGR and pre-eclampsia, or because of the abnormal fragility of the FM [16] , such as pPROM. One proposed molecular explanation of the obstetrical alteration by phthalates is their ability to alter the signaling pathway supported by the nuclear receptor PPAR\u03b3. If the link between phthalates and this receptor has been relatively well studied in placenta [8, 18] , no study has focused on the deregulation of the activity of this receptor in FMs during pPROM. Moreover, considering the essential character of PPAR\u03b3 during pregnancy and its anti-inflammatory action in FMs, it seemed interesting to study the impact of the toxic compounds in fetal membranes and to determine if such chemicals can be a factor in the preterm rupture of these membranes.",

This is more evident for the amnion in direct contact with the amniotic fluid, where the phthalates accumulate throughout pregnancy; hence, this layer is more likely to suffer from the phthalates' toxic properties. In addition, the amnion expresses PPAR\u03b3 at lower levels than the choriodecidua and could present decreased PPAR\u03b3 molecular actions as a result. With a lower expression of PPAR\u03b3 in the third trimester, the amnion will be less protected against inflammation by this nuclear receptor at the end of pregnancy. The phthalates could then interfere with this specific process, which could be exacerbated and take place in the global dysregulation of molecular events (oxidative stress, ECM degradation, senescence, etc.) leading to earlier and more intense weakening of the FM.",

            "text": "To establish this PPAR\u03b3 dysregulation, we used one the most present phthalates in amniotic fluid, that is, MEHP, and the amniotic cell line AV3, here modeling the direct contact of epithelial cells of the inner fetal membrane with the amniotic fluid. This interference was established using three doses of MEHP (1, 10, and 100 \u00b5M), covering the concentration ranges of this compound observed in the physiological fluids of pregnant women [21] [22] [23] . Regardless of the doses tested, MEHP was not toxic for amniotic cells and did not affect their viability. Therefore, MEHP did not enhance cellular death, which is one of the cellular mechanisms weakening FMs at the end of pregnancy. We also did not observe a decrease in terms of PPAR\u03b3 expression, excluding this molecular mechanism in explaining the dysregulation occurring from phthalates on this nuclear signaling pathway. Several recent research works have demonstrated that PPAR\u03b3 expression (mRNA and protein) can be altered with different doses of MEHP in the placenta area. However, mixed results depending on the cell lines used have been found, thus demonstrating that MEHP's impact on PPAR\u03b3 expression is cell and tissue specific [8, 24] . By contrast, treatment for 24 h with a PPAR\u03b3 agonist (rosiglitazone) induced a significant increase in nuclear receptor activity, whereas the use of an antagonist (GW9662) abolished this induction, confirming the functionality of the current study's model. MEHP alone does not modify the activity of the receptor activity, indicating that this compound does not behave as an agonist of the receptor. On the other hand, these experiments have demonstrated that MEHP suppressed the agonist-induced activation of the PPAR\u03b3 receptor, thus testifying to the antagonistic effect of this phthalate. This effect could be explained in particular by the fact that MEHP decreases the capacity of PPAR\u03b3 to release its coregulator NCoR, but also its ability to recruit coactivators (p300), as demonstrated during crystallographic studies [25] . This selective recruitment of coregulators results in a partial or null transcription of PPAR\u03b3-regulated genes and, thus, a partial activity of the receptor.",

Several studies show that when one (thiazo-lidinedione) of its ligands activates this receptor, the expression of proinflammatory protein (e.g., IL-6 or IL-8) was decreased [26] . In the present study, it was demonstrated that the MEHP, by deregulating PPAR\u03b3 pathway activation, could deregulate its anti-inflammatory properties in amniotic cells. In fact, in a proinflammatory environment (created with LPS), the expression of IL-6 and IL-8 was increased when the cells, and hence the receptors, were in the presence of a combination of MEHP and agonist. Thus, MEHP, in the FMs context, can emphasize the inflammation already present, which can be linked to a premature weakening of the membrane and can induce pPROM. Moreover, this receptor is also known to be able to control the gene involved in oxidative stress regulation [27] , which is another process that can be linked to FM weaknesses. It has already been demonstrated that MEHP is able to increase oxidative stress [28] in FMs, so it will be interesting to study if, through the PPAR\u03b3 signaling pathway, this compound could also deregulate this molecular event involved in FM rupture.",

Nevertheless, this cell line has been characterized for use as a model for the investigation of prostaglandin-cytokine interactions in human amnion. The AV3 cell line presents the same basal levels of IL-6 and IL-8 as those observed in primary amnion cells, which is why this cell line was used in this study [29] . In addition, we demonstrated that the AV3 cell line naturally expressed PPAR\u03b3, excluding the transfection of PPAR\u03b3 plasmid expression, leading to a more physiological model of amniotic epithelial cells.
