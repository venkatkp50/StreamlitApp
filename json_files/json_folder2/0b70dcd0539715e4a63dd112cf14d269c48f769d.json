A sample of 950 women-owned SMEs was considered, and structured questionnaires were sent from getting target responses. After careful assessment through the data cleansing procedure, it was found that only 795 responses are suitable for further investigation, implying the sample response rate for the study is 74.71%. The study implemented structural equation modeling and multivariate regression analysis for gauging the causal association that is direct and indirect effects of target variables. According to findings, a positive statistically significant linkage was revealed with women's entrepreneurship sustainability and women empowerment. Furthermore, the mediating effects were also established for women's empowerment. According to the study findings, it is suggested that for women entrepreneurship sustainability, effective policies surrounding financing accessibility, technical knowledge expansion, and financial understating have to be promulgated in the economy, which allows bringing women empowerment at large.",

Women are also treated worse than men owing to society's rules, norms, customs, and character. This unreasonable attitude toward women puts them at a disadvantage socially, culturally, religiously, economically, and legally. Furthermore, due to a paucity of resources and an overcrowded country, Bangladeshi women are the most disadvantaged, and services and opportunities are strictly separated by gender, class, and area. The study of Khanum et al. (2020) postulated that women's economic empowerment is critical for sustainable development because, without their involvement in mainstream development programs, it would be impossible to institutionalize the sustainable development process in Bangladesh. Since the 1990s, Bangladesh has experienced a boom in women entrepreneurs and their contribution to the economy. Women entrepreneurship growth is required to empower females and help them better their financial situation. By encouraging women to start and operate their businesses, women SMEs improve their financial potential. It is also the key driver of progress in underdeveloped nations like Bangladesh (Zafar and Mustafa, 2017) .",

These achievements in socio-economic areas enlarged and expanded the window of opportunity for attaining gender equality. Bangladesh was ranked #1 for the second straight year in the World Economic Forum's Gender Gap Index 2017. Womenfolk in Bangladesh are increasingly acting as catalysts for development activities. Thus, Bangladesh has paid pragmatic attention to economic development, educational development, and social changes that improved living standards and provided health care to the common people. Most precisely to empower half of the country's neglected population, that is, women. Bangladesh cannot achieve its long-term development goal without women's empowerment. As a result of women's empowerment, the government has implemented national policies to assist the growth of women in all fields of economic activity, with a particular emphasis on their entrepreneurial development.",

It implies that women's empowerment, which is the capacity to increase purchasing power with economic stability, is a noticeable outcome of women's entrepreneurship development. The evolvement of women's entrepreneurship in Bangladesh has gotten attention from researchers, policymakers, and donor agencies, and several policies have been initiated for entrepreneurship development among women participants. However, the empirical literature has not extensively investigated the association between women's entrepreneurship development and empowerment. To our best knowledge, this is the first-ever empirical assessment to explore the fresh insight regarding the nexus between women's entrepreneurship development and women empowerment.",

Mostly Banks are not relying on women to provide the credit in business initiatives while they demand some securities to give loans. In a study, Khaleque (2018) documented a positive linkage between access to finance and operational performance in women entrepreneurs in Bangladesh. In the same vein, Chamani et al. (2017) suggested that credit availability can be helpful to increase women's entrepreneurship. Taiwo et al. (2016) investigated the effect of credit facilities on women entrepreneurs on job creation for women in Nigeria. According to the study funding women, entrepreneurs is favorably linked with job creation through increasing their company operations. Another issue recognized by several surveys is difficulties in access to finance. Many financing institutions have failed to provide loan facilities. Banker's behaviors should be helpful for women in business development. The result of the booming business of women enhances women empowerment .",

            "text": "Financial educational programs aiming at increasing financial literacy educate people about various financial ideas and instruments and empower them by improving their financial abilities related to the usage of financial goods and risk management. Gupta and Kaur (2014) advocated that financial skills help people improve their financial literacy levels. In another study, Finke et al. (2017) postulated that financial literacy is the possession of financial knowledge and ability to manage money and enables the capacity to use knowledge and skills to manage financial resources for a lifetime of financial wellbeing properly.\" Financial literacy is also described by Engstr\u00f6m and McKelvie (2017) in terms of financial knowledge and abilities. Financial literacy encompasses understanding financial ideas and using such information to make good financial choices and create methods for successfully managing financial resources (Lusardi and Tufano, 2015) . Entrepreneurs often act instinctively, take calculated risks, and occasionally, due to their overconfidence and optimism, fail to evaluate all of the information shown to them about the company they have chosen, and therefore suffer several losses. Financial literacy is critical for entrepreneurs because it equips them to make sound judgments based on facts and make the most prudent financial choices. Entrepreneurship and financial literacy are topics high on the worldwide agenda since they facilitate the effective use of financial resources. Adequate financial education promotes prudent product selection based on educated judgments (Atandi et al., 2017) . In literature, several studies have been performed in assessing the role of financial literacy on entrepreneurial development across the world see Kojo Oseifuah (2010) A study conducted by Egbo et al. (2020) investigates the association between financial literacy and access to credit by women entrepreneurs in Nigeria. The study documented that financial knowledge was a key element in expanding womenowned businesses, particularly during start-up. Additionally, the study established that financial expertise is essential to the development and success of women-owned businesses. Financial literacy and ability are necessary for women to build an entrepreneurial spirit and grow their entrepreneurial activities effectively, manage their personal and family money, and increase their success in their entrepreneurial areas of interest. It is critical to equip women entrepreneurs with the knowledge and skills necessary to make smart and good financial decisions. Sucuahi (2013) disclosed that financial literacy positively augments the growth prospects of SMEs by enabling the owners for efficient funds management and appropriate credit sources selection. The study also postulated that women's entrepreneurial growth immensely relies on appropriate credit selection. Usama and Yusoff (2018) have investigated the relationship between entrepreneurial financial literacy on firm performance and sustainability in women entrepreneurship in Nigeria. Study findings unveiled that financial skills and firms' sustainability move together: business empowerment through appropriate credit selection and funds maximization allows higher profitability with lower financing cost. Thus, the study emphasized enhancing financial literacy through financial understanding, which eventually assists them in running successful operations. Financial literacy refers to the extent to which an individual comprehends critical financial concepts and has the ability and confidence to manage money prudently, focusing on short-term decision-making and long-term financial planning (Remund, 2010) .",

There is a substantial body of research on the subject, and agreement exists that women empowerment is a process including resources, agency, and accomplishments (Buvinic and Furst-Nichols, 2014) . Empowerment, also known as \"exercise of agency, \" is a process that results in a final women empowerment outcome that has both an objective (economic accomplishment) and a subjective component (economic empowerment). The main aspects of women empowerment may be classified as contextual and household variables that influence women's economic opportunities and capacities, including individual (and community) endowments that allow women to exercise agency and capitalize on economic possibilities. Resources refer to education strength, financial future security, and wealth for investment (Corbridge, 2002) . Furthermore, access to resources has greater potential to accessibility in allocation and execution of expectations (Sen, 2014) . Agency explained that Being able to influence significant aspects of one's life via one's actions and the ability to make and act on choices and control resources and earnings is known as economic empowerment (Mehra et al., 2012; Buvinic and O'Donnell, 2017) .

Financial literacy assists individuals in making financial choices. Informed financial decisions on investments, savings, banking, and borrowing are less susceptible to financial fraud. The complexity of financial goods readily accessible to broad audiences, such as internet banking, e-wallets, etc., has raised the significance of financial expertise. Globally, governments strive for financial inclusion to provide access to financial services, including bank accounts and credit products. Moreover, improvements in financial goods have empowered individuals who previously depended on their jobs or governments for financial security (Klapper et al., 2015) .

The results of instrument validation reports are in Table 4 . According to standard guidelines, the factor loading coefficient in any instrument should be greater than 0.7 to be treated as suitable for further causal effects assessment (Pu et al., 2021) . Furthermore, regarding the multicollinearity issue, the coefficient of variance inflation factors should be less than 3. In any circumstance, the value of VIF greater than 3 should pay more attention to the final model assessment because multicollinearity in construct can produce spurious estimation. Refers to the factor loading coefficients for the variables latent construct, it is revealed that all the factor loading coefficients are more significant than the standard thresholds, suggesting internal consistency and construction validation. Moreover, the multicollinearity test established that latent constructs are free from that issue. Considering the instruments' validation coefficients, it is now revealed that instruments can address and detect the causal effects. Table 5 shows the descriptive assessment of latent constructs of the causal model. It reveals that the mean and SD of access to finance is 3.3422 (SD = 1.1090), mean and SD of financial literacy is 3.3424 (SD = 1.26901).

First, study findings divulged positive statistically significant linkage between target variables, i.e., access to finance, technical know-how, financial literacy, and women entrepreneur sustainability. Study findings suggest that to bring prosperity to women's entrepreneurial development, it is essential to ensure easy access to financial services and credit extension programs, opportunities for enhancing technical expertise, and financial education. In a study, Mungai (2021) postulated that women entrepreneurs are passing with several building blocks in entrepreneurial capacity development among factors the access to credit placed in the apex spot. Accessibility to financial products and services inject required forces in entrepreneur development by subsiding the progress of economic and resource constraints. Access to finance has opened up an economic avenue for women's entrepreneurial development (Manwari et al., 2017) .

Financial institutions may tap into a rising market of women customers by offering welldesigned microfinance, SME, and leasing products that suit their requirements. Similarly, increasing women's demand for money requires a combination of financial goods and wellthought-out regulations. This must involve increasing women's ownership and control of their land and assets (i.e., property rights) to assist them in meeting collateral requirements and increasing women's financial knowledge to utilize current financing programs.

Study findings suggest that entrepreneurial growth in the dynamic environment is essential to have technical expertise for exploiting the advancement in operational efficiency through technological integration. The potential for women entrepreneurship to grow due to IT integration to enhance company operations and expand market share. IT integration enables businesses to remain accessible 24 h a day to customers worldwide and customize services. This helps create new entrepreneurial possibilities, particularly for womenled businesses. According to Costanza et al. (2003) , women's entrepreneurship contributes to economic development and provides job possibilities. Numerous research has indicated a link between women entrepreneurship and women empowerment. Empowerment is the process by which an individual move from a position of powerlessness to one of relative control over his or her life, destiny, and surroundings. This shift may be seen in both an increase in perceived capacity to control and an increase in actual ability to control. Third, the role of financial literacy on women entrepreneurial development and women empowerment and in this study established positive statistically significant linkage between them. It suggests from study findings that financial understanding allows appropriate selection of credit extension model and substantially reduces the risk of a future failure. According to Engstr\u00f6m and McKelvie (2017) , more financial knowledge improves financial decision-making and an increased appreciation for financial problems faced in the present or future. Additionally, Lusardi and Tufano (2015) discovered a stronger correlation between financial knowledge and financial literacy. This demonstrates the critical importance of understanding financial terminology and ideas, the foundation for good financial decision-making. As a result, the more one's financial literacy, the greater one's literacy level.",

Additionally, the study established that financial expertise is essential to the development and success of women-owned businesses. Financial literacy and ability are necessary for women to build an entrepreneurial spirit and grow their entrepreneurial activities effectively, manage their personal and family money, and increase their success in their entrepreneurial areas of interest. It is critical to equip women entrepreneurs with the knowledge and skills necessary to make smart and good financial decisions (Lafortune and Tessada, 2015) . Further, financial expertise is essential to developing and succeeding women-owned businesses, fundamental accounting, and bookkeeping skills, budgeting, financial management, money raising and allocation, loan management, investment, and people management.
