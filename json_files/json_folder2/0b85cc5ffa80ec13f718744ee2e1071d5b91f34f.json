In addition, rehabilitation of COVID-19 should focus on education and development of self-management skills (Barker-Davies et al., 2020) . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) framework for primary care following a pandemic advocate that rehabilitation should be a priority for patients recovering from an infection (Krist et al., 2020) .

Our recruitment strategy was limited by the unique COVID-19 context because clinical teams within designated hospitals faced staff shortages and rapid turnover. Also, clinical settings faced daily to weekly changes in procedures due to frequently changing recommendations from government officials. Despite this context, we could build communication channels with attending physicians and physiotherapists and understand the environments of COVID-19 units. The results of this study are not generalizable to all patients recovering from COVID-19. Several COVID-19 rehabilitation subgroups likely exist. The lack of a control group and the small sample size precludes a precise assessment of the effectiveness of the intervention versus natural recovery.
