The most well-known is probably Borrelia burgdorferi s.l., which is among the most common causes of tick-borne infection in Europe and North America, but the actual incidence is uncertain due to heterogenic surveillance systems without mandatory notification [1] . However, a number of other tick-borne pathogens cause disease in humans and are dominant causes in other parts of the world, as well as being present in Europe and North America. These include among others rickettsiosis, babesiosis, human anaplasmosis and tick-borne encephalitis. Tick-borne infections may present with unspecific symptoms including fever, headache, myalgia, arthralgia and fatigue [2] [3] [4] , in addition to more specific symptoms, like an eschar or a typical rash in rickettsiosis [3] and an erythema migrans in borreliosis [2] . The tick Ixodes ricinus is present in many parts of Europe [5] , and it is the primary tick species of human concern in Denmark. I. ricinus serves as a vector for various infectious agents and is known to feed readily on a wide variety of hosts, including humans [6] . The tick requires a humid microclimate during its life cycle and to remain active while seeking a blood host [7] . Generally, it is accepted that the incidence of tick-borne infections is influenced by changing weather conditions [8] . Two of the most abundant microorganisms found in Danish ticks are B. burgdorferi and Rickettsia helvetica [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] , which cause infections in humans of varying severity.",

The 12 well slides (Erie Scientific LCC, Portsmouth, USA) were prepared with R. helvetica and R. felis antigen and fixated with 99% methanol.

The serum was screened at titers 1:16 and 1:32 with further twofold serial dilution if positive at these titers. A titer \u2265 1:64 was considered positive for IgG and \u2265 1:32 for IgM. Antigens and positive control serum for spotted fever group rickettsiae (titers 1:64 IgG and 1:16 IgM) were provided by the French Reference Center for Rickettsioses (FRCR, M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Infection, Marseille, France), negative control serum was from a healthy donor confirmed negative for anti-rickettsial antibodies at the FRCR.

This indicates that anti-B. burgdorferi antibodies do not remain in the blood to a level above Anti-Rickettsia felis antibodies 0 0 0 the cut-off of serological analysis for several years unless reactivated by a new infection. If antibodies persisted for 2 or more years, the prevalence would be at least double the incidence. This finding accounts for serological analysis and cannot be transferred to the intrathecal antibody test, as this is relying on the index of antibody amount between serum and cerebrospinal fluid. This may be positive when the serological analysis is negative [40] and it has been proposed to remain positive for years [41] . The IgG seroprevalence in our study is in concordance with previous blood donor data from the Region of Southern Denmark [42] . Eleven IgM-positive participants were continuously positive in the follow-up without significant titer change or development of IgG antibodies, and the factor analysis found no correlation between tick bites and the presence of anti-B. burgdorferi IgM antibodies in serum. This could indicate that cautions should be taken regarding clinical interpretation of serum IgM antibodies as previously suggested [35] , especially without relevant symptoms or a follow-up blood sample. There was only one participant positive for anti-Rickettsia spp. antibodies, and she was asymptomatic, which indicates that autochthonous rickettsiosis is currently of least concern to the public health in the region. In Denmark B. burgdorferi and R. helvetica are common, indicating that the transmission of, or infectious/pathogenic potential for B. burgdorferi is higher than for R. helvetica, as one study that included Southern Jutland reported nearly equal prevalence of the two bacteria in sampled ticks [13] . The result is in concordance with a study showing that most recorded cases of rickettsiosis in Denmark are due to imported African tick bite fever usually caused by R. africae [30] . The investigated region of Southern Jutland is particularly interesting regarding tick-borne infections since this is the primary region exposed to migrating land-based animals from the European mainland bringing new tick species and pathogens with them [43] . As R. helvetica is the only rickettsial species being reported in nearly all studies on Danish ticks [9] [10] [11] [12] [14] [15] [16] , with single findings of Rickettsia massiliae [13] and Rickettsia raoultii [43] being the exceptions, R. helvetica is the likely cause of the seroconversion. However, due to antibody cross-reactivity between rickettsial species, it is not absolutely certain. There was no serological evidence of R. felis being present in the studied area of Denmark, though its presence has been reported in neighboring Germany [44] [45] [46] and Sweden [47, 48] . We found no significant difference between reported symptoms, except for wound after an insect bite or of unknown causes, in groups exposed to tick bites or with seroconversion indicating that in some instances symptoms, which may be related to tick-borne infections are common in the general population, e.g. headache, myalgia and arthralgia, and hence unspecific. It also indicates that symptoms more related to infection, like fever and EM, are rare even after exposure to ticks or the tick-borne pathogens present in our region of Denmark. These findings correlate with results from Holland, Switzerland and Sweden [26, 37, 49] . However, the design does impose a risk of recall bias and under-reporting, as mild symptoms may not be remembered or noted (e.g. low fever) and the bitten person does not necessarily acknowledge a tick bite shown by the number of neuroborreliosis patients reporting tick bites [18, 19] .",

The participant with short-term fever could be the only participant with potential symptomatic tick-borne infection. Unfortunately, no follow-up blood samples were obtained from these individuals. The simplified questionnaire without registration of amount of time spent outdoors and exact location explains the deviance from the fact that people who spend a lot of time in tick-infested areas are expectedly at an increased risk of being bitten, even though spending time outdoors, in general, did not seem to be a risk factor. Furred animals could potentially pose a risk of tick bites in some settings as they could act as hosts for ticks and carry these to the proximity of humans. However, the animals need to be exposed to ticks to do this. Unfortunately, the study design made it impossible to distinguish between animals exposed to ticks and not, though animals noted as strictly indoor pets were excluded from analysis along with lizards. Many unrecorded factors can influence human exposure to ticks, but owning a furred animal does not seem to be an isolated risk factor. A Scandinavian study on risk factors neither found an association between pet ownership and reported tick bites, but between outdoor activities and reported tick bites [50] .",

However, there were no significant differences between the two seasons in either tick bites or seroconversion among the participants. In addition, there were no differences in the number of reported tick bites in each group from 2018 to 2019. Within-season weather fluctuations have previously been suggested as a factor, influencing the amount of tickhuman interaction [52] though, in our study, the overall difference between full seasons was investigated. The lack of difference coincides with data suggesting relatively stable seasonal distribution of reported neuroborreliosis cases over more extended periods [53] , with the primary influence being access to roe deer, the main feeding and mating host [54] .",

The observations are based on a geographical setting where I. ricinus is the only evidently established tick species of human concern.
