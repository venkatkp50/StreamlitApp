MendelScan encodes diagnostic/screening criteria for multiple rare diseases, mapping clinical terms to appropriate SNOMED CT codes (UK primary care standardised clinical terminology) to create digital algorithms. These algorithms were applied to a pseudoanonymised structured data extract of the electronic health records (EHR) in this locality to \"flag\" at-risk patients who may require further evaluation. All flagged patients then underwent internal clinical review (a doctor reviewing each EHR flagged by the algorithm, removing all cases with a clear diagnosis/diagnoses that explains the clinical features that led to the patient being flagged); for those that passed this review, a report was returned to their GP. 55 of 76 disease criteria flagged at least one patient. 227 (0.33%) of the total 68,705 of EHR were flagged; 18 EHR were already diagnosed with the disease (the highlighted EHR had a diagnostic code for the same RD it was screened for, e.g. Behcet's disease algorithm identifying an EHR with a SNOMED CT code Behcet's disease). 75/227 (33%) EHR passed our internal review. Thirty-six reports were returned to the GP. Feedback was available for 28/36 of the reports sent. GP categorised nine reports as \"Reasonable possible diagnosis\" (advance for investigation), six reports as \"diagnosis has already been excluded\", ten reports as \"patient has a clear alternative aetiology\", and three reports as \"Other\" (patient left study locality, unable to re-identify accurately). All the 9 cases considered as \"reasonable possible diagnosis\" had further evaluation.",

In the UK and the European Union (EU), a rare disorder is defined as affecting fewer than 1 in 2000 persons [4, 5] . 71.9% are considered genetic diseases, and 69.9% have a paediatric-onset [2] . Of all RD, 149 diseases (4.2%) have a prevalence in the range of 1-5 per 10,000, these account for 77.3-80.7% of the total population of patients affected. Collectively RD are a significant burden to healthcare systems and society, in the US the annual economic burden of 379 RD, with a combined incidence of 15.5 million, was estimated to be $966 billion in 2019 [6] . Rare disease diagnosis is challenging, patients frequently remain without a correct diagnosis for extended periods. This hunt for a diagnosis has its own term: the diagnostic odyssey [7] . During this diagnostic odyssey, patients typically experience numerous primary care visits, specialist clinic reviews, investigations, interventions, misdiagnoses and inappropriate treatments [8] . A cohort of patients with RD in the UK and US reported a diagnostic delay of an average of 5.6 and 7.6 years respectively, with patients typically visiting eight physicians (four primary care and four specialists) and receiving two to three misdiagnoses [9] . Similarly, an EU survey reported that 40% of patients with RD were initially incorrectly diagnosed, and a quarter experienced a diagnostic odyssey of more than 5 years [10].",

Those that are encoded and therefore appearing in a structured data extract recorded, represent diagnoses that are recorded with a greater degree of confidence and therefore more reliable, with free text entries used by clinicians when they are less confident in the diagnosis. Consequently, one can consider the quality of this coded data as a strength. However, this means that the majority of information in the EHR was not examined by MendelScan. Free text diagnoses, clinical features and the content of correspondence, often rich in information, was not examined. For example, secondary care correspondence often rich in pertinent information may only generate two pieces of structured data: the presence of the letter and possibly a single diagnostic code. In addition, the motivators and context for coding in primary care needs to be considered, including the demonstration that certain tasks have been performed for reimbursement (e.g. Quality and Outcomes Framework) and to have pertinent information quickly to hand for future consultations.",
