The presented papers in this session tackle different dimensions of accessibility evaluation from different perspectives e.g. user requirements elicitation for large scale evaluation of websites, using meta data of digital artefacts such as chatbots to assess their accessibility, physical versus digital accessibility and tools to evaluate easy language on websites. Holistic web accessibility evaluation is a complex task that requires powerful cloud infrastructure to cope with the huge amount of data produced during the evaluation process according to legal frameworks.",

The concept of accessible design ensures both \"direct access\" (i.e., unassisted) and \"indirect access\" meaning compatibility with a person's assistive technology (for example, computer screen readers). Accessibility and usability of physical devices including wearables, sensors and actuators requires special attention to ensure access and ease of use for users with disabilities and elderly persons throughout the entire development life cycle. This can be achieved in case of web and mobile applications through consideration of accessibility guidelines already from the user requirements phase to design, development and finally evaluation phase at running time. Usable and accessible design features of physical gadgets include aspects related to workflow (suitability for typical user tasks, etc.), interaction design (conformance to user expectations, e.g., dialogue design), information presentation (clear and consistent page layout, wording) [3] . Evaluating the virtual prototypes of physical devices can be achieved by using simulated users.",

Observatories as a regime software must provide easy access for monitoring bodies, web commissioner, web accessibility experts and web developer. The monitoring body selects the required websites in a sample that fulfills the WAD requirements; the web commissioner can conduct the automatic evaluation of the websites of the sample, the web commissioner can provides then access to the web accessibility expert to conduct the manual part of the evaluation based on the automatic evaluation results. A combined report out of the automatic and manual results should be created automatically and the results should be made available to the monitoring body and other stakeholder. On the other side, the web commissioner can provide access to the web developer to correct any detected issues during the evaluation. These observatories require holistic technologies and sophisticated powerful cloud infrastructure that requires a lot of development and experimentation to reach efficient and cost effective results as described in th WADcher 5 project [1, 2] . The WADcher project is building a large-scale infrastructure by integrating extended and enhanced existing web accessibility solutions, and by making them customizable to the needs of different stakeholders in EU member states. This will result in the minimisation of costs and development-time along with increased scalability, accessibility and usability for all types of end-users including older users and users with special needs.",

            "text": "1. Maria Laura de Filippis et al. present a common framework and guidelines on how to assess the perceived quality of interaction of chatbots. They investigate these aspects from a system's perspective; the subjective experience of quality derives from the interaction between the user and the application under specific conditions and contexts. They investigate then how factors of perceived quality of interaction are measured in studies of AI-based agents that support people with disabilities or special needs through a systematic literature review performed in accordance with the PRISMA 6 reporting checklist. The results of the present study suggest that informal and untested measures of quality are often employed when it comes to evaluating user interactions with AI agents. This is particularly relevant in the health and well-being domain, where researchers set out to measure the clinical validity of tools intended to support people with disabilities or special needs. 2. Ana Iglesias et al. introduces the Comp4Text online readability evaluation tool, which is able to calculate the readability level of a web page based on classical linguistic measures (sentence to sentence), and detects unusual words and abbreviations. The authors introduce Comp4Text checker, a new web readability evaluation tool for Spanish web pages, based on classical linguistic measures and making recommendations to improve the readability of the web pages in a very visual way. 3. Christophe Ponsard et al. present a paper about the accessibility evaluations of digital and physical worlds. Digital services reduce the need to physically move hence to have to face physical accessibility barriers, but it becomes then more critical to make sure they are not replaced by digital accessibility barriers. In order to assess the interplay of both worlds from the accessibility perspective, the authors collected available data and used automated tools from three different perspectives: one starting from physically accessible places and looking at the digital accessibility of their online services, the second going the other way and finally a representative sample of services from the same smart city. They found a good combined level of accessibility in about one third of the places. Mutual strengthening could also be observed, usually greater on the digital accessibility side and revealing that awareness actions in one field also contribute to improve the other. 4. Fabio Patern\u00f2 et al. present a paper about user requirements elicitation for largescale accessibility evaluations of websites. They argue that the recent European legislation emphasizes the importance of enabling people with disabilities to have access to online information and services of public sector bodies. To this regard, automatic evaluation and monitoring of Web accessibility can play a key role for various stakeholders involved in creating and maintaining over time accessible products. They then present the results of elicitation activities that they carried out in the WADcher project to collect experience and feedback from Web commissioners, developers and content authors of websites and web applications. The purpose was to understand their current practices in addressing accessibility issues, identify the barriers they encounter when exploiting automatic support in ensuring the accessibility of Web resources, and receive indications about what functionalities they would like to exploit in order to better manage large-scale accessibility evaluation and monitoring. Each of these stakeholders represents a user role with specific requirements that emerged during their research and which have been considered in the design phase.",
