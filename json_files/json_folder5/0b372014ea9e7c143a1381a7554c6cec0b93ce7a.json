Situational factors such as inclement weather and, on a larger scale, pandemics or national disasters can also temporarily render individuals homebound. For example, in March 2020, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [2] warned older adults to remain at home due to the disproportionate COVID-19-related health risks that they face. Prior to the pandemic, an estimated 1 in 4 older US adults were already socially isolated, and this rate has likely increased [3] .",

Travel is not always an option. Safety, health, or personal reasons may prevent researchers from entering a home or community. Travel may be too costly or otherwise impractical, or participants may live in an area that is inaccessible to the project team. During the COVID-19 pandemic for example, academic and practice-based project teams have anecdotally reported barriers to in-person visits, including the need to distance themselves from infected and at-risk individuals, members of project teams working from home, and the need to reduce travel expenses due to economic pressures. Even if in-person visits are possible, remote testing can also be more convenient and cost-efficient for all parties involved.",

We found no published instance of fully remote usability testing with older adults. Diamantidis et al [29] conducted a test of a mobile health system with older individuals with chronic kidney disease. Participants received an in-person tutorial of the system; they used the system at home, received physical materials by mail, and completed a paper diary. Afterward, they returned to complete an in-person satisfaction survey. Petrie et al [24] reported 2 case studies of remote usability testing-one with blind younger adults (n=8) and another with a more heterogeneous group of individuals with disabilities (n=51). They demonstrated the feasibility of remote testing and showed comparable results between in-person and remote testing, although in-person participants in the second study reported more usability problems with the tested website.",

Additionally, the use of large closed captions during a remote testing session has been recommended for older users with visual or hearing impairments. Holden [33] published a Simplified System Usability Scale that was modified for and tested with older adults and those with cognitive disabilities but did not demonstrate its use in remote testing.",

The use of technology for remote services among older adults in the United States has been increasing [35, 36] , as has older adults' proficiency with internet-based technology [37] . A Pew Research Center national survey reported increases in internet use (from 12% to 67%) and the adoption of home broadband (from 0% to 51%) from 2000 to 2016, as well as increases in smartphone (from 11% to 42%) and tablet (from 1% to 32%) ownership from 2011 to 2016 [4] . However, the older adult population is diverse and has different needs compared to those of other groups when it comes to technology and the usability testing of technology. US adults aged 65 years are more likely than their younger counterparts to experience difficulties with physical or cognitive function, including reduced memory capacity, stiff joints or arthritis, and vision or hearing disability [38, 39] . These factors and the discomfort with or reduced motivation to use technology elevate the importance of usability testing [40] but ironically may increase the difficulty of conducting remote usability testing. Additional recommendations and best practices will thus be needed to ensure effective and efficient remote usability testing with older adults.",
