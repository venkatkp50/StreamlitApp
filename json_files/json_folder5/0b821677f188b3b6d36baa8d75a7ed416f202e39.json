            "text": "in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and has led to a global pandemic. The disease causing the pandemic has been named the new coronavirus disease 2019 . Data dated 06.06.2020 released from the World Health Organization (WHO) indicated that the confirmed number of COVID-19 patients worldwide was 6 644 011, and the number of people who lost their lives to COVID-19 was 391 839. 4 COVID-19 can infect people through air born transmission as tiny droplets suspended in the air produced when someone sneezes or coughs. The virus can also spread through objects or surfaces being touched by infected people, and through close contact such as shaking hands, kissing, etc. 5, 6 Taking protective measures is very important during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the compliance of healthcare professionals responsible for the care and treatment of suspected COVID-19 patients with personal protective measures is extremely important in terms of safe, quality and sustainable health services. 7 In Turkey, isolation precautions in suspected COVID-10 patients were determined by the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 Infection) handbook of the Ministry of Health. 8 Essentially, the compliance of healthcare professionals with these isolation rules is essential for both their own health and the well-being of society. There is a high risk in emergency services where suspected COVID-19 patients come first and for the personnel exposed to the disease while working in these services. Isolation precautions are very important for emergency personnel faced with this high risk. Determining personnel's compliance with isolation precautions is a critical process.",

In this regard, it is recommended that every institution assess the adherence to the isolation precautions, remedy the deficiencies found during the assessment based on the troubles they experience, and take precautions. To remedy the deficiencies, information should be updated through in-service training. In addition, healthcare personnel's quality of working conditions should be improved, which in turn improves the quality of care provided by emergency healthcare personnel and reduces the rate of healthcare-related infection.",

The transmission occurs when other people come in contact with the respiratory secretions spread in the environment by symptomatic or asymptomatic people, or when people touch their own mouth, nose or eye mucosa with hands contaminated with these secretions.10,11 In the global COVID-19 epidemic, healthcare professionals in emergency units are at high risk of infection due to direct contact with COVID-19 patients. Protection of healthcare professionals who risk their lives is only possible through infection control and compliance with precautions.12 The participants' total Compliance with Isolation Precautions Scale (CIPS) score was moderate and their CIPS subscale score levels were as follows: a high mean score on the mode of transmission subscale, an average mean score on the personnel and patient safety subscale, a high mean score on the environment control subscale, and an average mean score on the hand hygiene-use of gloves subscale.A literature review revealed similar results with the results of this study.[13][14][15][16] Participants showed high levels of receiving training, knowing the type of isolation practiced and putting patients with COVID-19 into isolation. The participants had high scores particularly on the mode of expression and environment control subscales.The moderate scores found on the personnel and patient safety subscale and the hand hygiene-use of gloves subscale may be due to the participants' inability to be careful enough due to the high number of patients or due to lack of training on this topic. In fact, the majority of the personnel indicated they wanted to receive training (86.2%). Based on this, it is extremely important to provide training for healthcare professionals in areas they lack knowledge as this can raise their awareness.The examination of the participants' understanding regarding isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic showed that most of the participants received training on isolation precautions. Additionally, most of the participants wanted to receive training. This may be due to ineffective training and/or the need to have more information as the COVID-19 pandemic has newly emerged throughout the world.",

Looking at the participants' features regarding isolation, it was observed that the majority of them (76.1%) received training.
