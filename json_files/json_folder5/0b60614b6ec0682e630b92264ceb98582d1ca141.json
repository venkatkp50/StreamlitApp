The current research investigated and compared \"Natives and Sojourners\" health-protective behavior in Mainland China during the pandemic. We adopted a unified view to propose our theoretical model by adapting the Health Belief Model (HBM) and Institutional Theory (IT). The data obtained through an online survey questionnaire from 435 respondents during the second and third quarters of were analyzed. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to empirically analyze the proposed model. The media self-efficacy (MSE), scientific self-efficacy (SSE), perceived health risks (PHRs), and the perceived benefits of being protected have positive and significant effects on the definition of health-protective behavioral intentions among natives and sojourners in mainland China. Media and SSE can play a strategic role in formulating public health-protective behavior. The current research recommends an effective communication with sojourners during crisis for them to be a part of the national crisis management plan (i.e., infectious disease).",

At present, no internationally recognized measures are used as standards to cure COVID-19 patients . However, preventive measures, e.g., wearing masks and gloves (Shahnazi et al., 2020) , frequent washing hands (alcohol-based disinfectants or soap; Wang et al., 2021) , restricting travel (Pandita et al., 2021) , and physical distancing (Yezli and Khan, 2020) , are implemented by institutions and governing bodies, because these measures are effective and helpful in controlling COVID-19 transmission. Although these all safety measures as discussed above have significant scientific justification, none of the existing research accounted for the role of scientific reasoning or individuals' scientific self-efficacy (SSE) to map quantitative behavioral map in society.",

Though, the existing behavioral studies addressing COVID-19 have adapted several theoretical stances to enrich the understanding and process of conceptualizing healthprotective behavior of individuals.

However, few researchers have investigated the psychological impact of the pandemic on sojourners, particularly how these sojourners acquire correct news (information) or what influences their health-protective behavior. As a significant difference exists among sojourners and natives, no trace of comparative analysis of sojourners and natives exists. Thus, a socio-psychological persuasive psychological model is needed to compare the healthprotective behavior of sojourners and natives.",

Zandifar and Badrfam (2020) also confirmed that misinformation about COVID-19 and social isolation have led to the public's mental morbidity. Several studies stated that the Chinese and international media have a significant impact on the psychological response, perception, and knowledge-seeking behavior (Xie et al., 2020) . Moreover, Gohel et al. (2021) stated that insufficient knowledge and lack of education are great challenges to surmount in dealing with the current pandemic crisis. The above-discussed trends and significant role of international and national media highlight that the cognitive factors of individuals need immediate need to underline individual's ability to process and identify and access reliable sources of information.

Within the hood of health psychology, various behavioral theories exist. These theories underline the role of persuasive socio-psychological constructs while conceptualizing health-concerned behavior of individuals, e.g., conceptualizing the health-protective behavior of the workforce (Barello et al., 2020; Mathai, 2020; Almazyad et al., 2021) or being vaccinated to avoid serious health crisis (Hu et al., 2017; Zampetakis and Melas, 2021) . In each scenario, most of the health-protective theories underline the constructs that can help mitigate the health challenges or adopt measures to avoid health challenges (i.e., pandemic crisis).",

            "text": "HBM is one of the most valuable frameworks for explaining health-related behavior, as it comprises the attributes of risk perception and behavioral evaluation (Cao et al., 2014) . In the pre-COVID-19 literature, HBM has been used to underline the breast self-examination behavior (Didarloo et al., 2017) , oral cancer prevention (Jeihooni et al., 2019) , exercise-related injury prevention program participation (Gabriel et al., 2019) , and healthy housing material selection of boomers Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org (Kwon and Ahn, 2019) . Moreover, during the current pandemic crisis, HBM has been used to determine the consumers' perception of forest therapy tourism (Zhao and An, 2021) , individual readiness towards home quarantine (Al-Sabbagh et al., 2021) , the role of community pharmacists in offering effective communication to society (Carico et al., 2020) , and citizens' readiness to get vaccinated (Zampetakis and Melas, 2021) . The intensive use of HBM in recent times signifies its significance and meaningfulness in depicting public healthprotective behavior. Therefore, HBM was adopted in the current research initiative, because it helps define the following interconstruct relationships, including (1) the role of perceived sense of exposure in driving individuals' preventive or protective behavior (Jones et al., 2015) ; (2) the current study further stretched the stance of Nex\u00f8e et al. (1999) as exogenous constructs (perceived barriers and benefits of being protected) in the HBM, which helped explain health-protective behavior. A similar pattern was observed in the study of Tong et al. (2020) , who examined the attitude towards adopting precautionary measures during the current pandemic . Champion and Skinner (2008) reported that the fundamental constructs of HBM do not have definite relationships. To maximize the explanatory power of the research, several studies extended HBM (Zampetakis and Melas, 2021) or adopted other theoretical stances to incorporate with HBM, i.e., Theory of Planned Behavior (Zhao and An, 2021) , Multidimensional Locus of Control Theory (Nex\u00f8e et al., 1999) , and Social Cognitive Theory (Reid and Aiken, 2011) . Jones et al. (2015) also analyzed different sets of arrangement within HBM, i.e., the parallel and serial mediating effects of benefits and barriers of being protected, to define health-protective behavior. Carpenter (2010) observed that in the early traces of HBM, the essence of self-efficacy was rarely used. However, in recent decades, it became an integral part of HBM, as it holds a significant explanatory power to define public health concerns and protective behavior (Carico et al., 2020; Mirzaei-Alavijeh et al., 2020; Shahnazi et al., 2020; Tajeri et al., 2020) . In existing HBM-based studies, self-efficacy was noted as a significant construct in exploring COVID19related behavioral research (Niu et al., 2021) . Zhou et al. (2020) suggested that correct news (information) could be an effective measure to control and reduce disease spread during the pandemic crisis, as self-efficacy enables individuals to seek valid and reliable health-related information in a more systematic fashion (Shang and Zuo, 2020) . In particular, during COVID-19, the conspiracy theory endorsement was recorded as a great challenge, especially when considering international media sources in China; it signified the role of cognition . In line with the arguments by Su et al. (2021) and Rosenstock et al. (1988) , the current research bifurcated cognition to propose the media and SSEs, thereby helping explain how these efficacies can benefit information processing and allow individuals to think critically (Austin et al., 2016) while formulating perception of risk and health-protective behavior. Several researchers explained the role of media (Cheng et al., 2020) and scientific (Stosic et al., 2021 ) as a part of cognition (belief and efficacy) in the recent literature addressing COVID19-related behavioral studies.",

Institutions can be understood as \"rules of the game in a society\" (North, 1990 ) that help shape individuals' beliefs and their nonrational behaviors (Scott, 2001) . The IT comprises three principal pillars, namely (1) regulative (2) normative, and (3) cognitive support (Scott, 2001) . Urban and Kujinga (2017) stated that the regulative pillar refers to authorities' regulations or guidelines to reward or punish actions (Valdez and Richardson, 2013) . Normative pillar means the social norms of society that individuals attempt to comply with (Seelos et al., 2011) . Cognitive pillar comprises the templates and scripts shared among a community or nation (Seelos et al., 2011) . Wu et al. (2019) indicated that an individual's intention and behavior are significantly affected by the normative environment. In particular, collectivist cultural countries have a high level of norms for individual behavior (Furnham et al., 2012; Shi et al., 2017) . Thus, in the context of the current research setting, the proposed model took the regulative and normative concerns into account. These concerns can be diffused with HBM as cues to action, because HBM-related literature argues that cues can range from internal or external sources; cues to define health-protective behavior are still an underdeveloped attribute of HBM (Jones et al., 2015) . Therefore, the current study takes this stance as an opportunity to use regulatory and normative support as a set of cues to act towards health-protective behavior. Bavel et al. (2020) argued that regulatory and social factors are essential to drive constructive social change and individual behavior during COVID-19.",

Ang et al. (2017) indicated that migrant workers who have more financial barriers to obtain healthcare services are more likely to suffer from low psychological well-being. Dias et al. (2013) state that migrants experience numerous socio-cultural, legal, economic, and communicational constraints, which expose them to many health risks. For instance, immigrants from non-native language-speaking countries encounter linguistic barriers to healthcare and access to service. Furthermore, recent literature emphasized the impact of the source of information (news) in China when defining readers' conceptualization of risk and fear of COVID-19 ; this source helps in the formulation of health orientation (Liu, 2021) , drives negative emotion, and affects psychological resilience (Giri and Maurya, 2021) . However, no previous report stated the use of the HBM in any setting to compare the sojourners and natives and to conceptualize the differences that can potentially drive practical implications and future research direction. Thus, in the context of the above-discussed argumentation, the following constructs' relationships are proposed for sojourners and natives in Mainland China during the pandemic crisis to map their health-protective behavior.",

In the current research, the four constructs from the HBM, namely (1) perceived exposure (2) PHRs (3) benefits, and (4) barriers of being protected, were considered as exogenous to conceptualize health-protective behavior (Cao et al., 2014) . Moreover, the proposed model also hypothesized the role of self-efficacy, which is an integral part of HBM, as suggested by Champion and Skinner (2008) and Jones et al.

Zampetakis and Melas (2021) mentioned PHR as an individual's perceived potential adverse consequences if the protective measures are ignored (Zampetakis and Melas, 2021) . In the case of COVID-19, HBM implies that the higher sense of exposure and a greater degree of perceived risk can lead to compromising circumstances for the psychological well-being (i.e., anxiety and depression) if the coping strategies (i.e., social support) are not adopted in an effective manner (Zvolensky et al., 2020) . The adopted theoretical stance argues that a greater sense of exposure helps individuals quantify risk in a more proactive manner to adopt preventive measures (i.e., vaccination; Carico et al., 2020) . Hence, the current research proposed the following hypotheses.",

(2021) stated that risk perception mediates the individuals' judgment while mapping certain health risks, i.e., severity or susceptibility of exposure. They further emphasized that self-efficacy can play a strategic role in formulating susceptibility, severity, exposure, risk perception, and healthprotective behavior. However, self-efficacy is less studied compared with the rest of the HBM's constructs (Rosenstock et al., 1988; Zhou et al., 2021) . MSE and SSE are also recorded as significant determinants to map an individual's cognitive and behavioral change during COVID-19. Thus, the following hypothesis was proposed in the current research. Fundamentally, MSE comprises the ability to operate media (platform) and the attributes to access, understand, and interact with media (Hammer et al., 2021) . Nur et al. (2016) argued that people know about the world through media. An individual's confidence in accessing, analyzing, evaluating, interacting, and participating is related to media content. In the context of the current pandemic crisis, trust in media has been recorded as a significant construct that defines public health-protective behavior (Niu et al., 2021) . Moreover, the source of information also helps define risk perception and related health-protective behavior . The challenge of MSE in the current pandemic is complex, because the impacts of international and domestic media sources vary in terms of the effect on society . Therefore, the following hypothesis was proposed.",

However, only 598 filled responses were received, whereas 163 response sets were excluded due to their incompleteness. The incomplete responses were the outcome of the data collection condition. Respondents were restricted from skipping questions. Therefore, incomplete responses can be the result of leaving the questionnaire resurvey in the pipeline.

Moreover, education in the case of sojourners was noted as the only control variable that was recorded as significant. While defining PHR, the perceived fear of susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 in terms of exposure were found to have a greater effect on natives than on sojourners. The comparatively high concern of being exposed can be related to the panic among migrants (including sojourner; Ullah et al., 2021) , as every responsible government is imposing safety measures to deal with COVID-19. The perceived exposure (concern) had a more significant impact on individuals' media and SSE among sojourners than among natives. The current findings can be argued on the basis of the descriptive profile of the respondents, as most of the sojourners rely on digital media and attend academic institutions for their tertiary-level education.

In-person communication has been replaced with digital medium and also drives a few challenges, i.e., COVID-19-related information overload (Song et al., 2021) and digital exclusion of nondigital natives and migrants (Nguyen et al., 2021) . Thus, this finding signifies the sensitivity of MSE. Furthermore, the SSE was a slightly stronger determinant among natives than among sojourners. The findings are in line with those obtained in Flynn Murphy's article in Nature (Murphy, 2020) , where the capable medial workforce in China contributed to digital media as a scientific communicator to explain COVID-19 and communicate related health-protective initiatives with citizens. The PHRs from COVID-19 and perceived benefits of being protected were two-fold stronger determinants for defining perceived health-protective behavior among sojourners than among the native Chinese. This pattern of findings can potentially lead to a future study, in which the role of national culture can be taken into account. China, with its traditions and value of collectivism, was the first country to ask its citizens to wear masks, whereas the Western region was still confirming the effectiveness of mask-wearing practice by conducting clinical trials and research (Zurong, 2020) ; this information was intentionally ignored in the current research.",

However, no studies have been performed on the physical and psychological impacts of outbreaks of COVID-19 on sojourners and natives. No research initiative ever tried to compare the efficacies or the impact of different cues to action among sojourners and natives in any particular setting.",

The perceived effectiveness and sense of connectivity between institutions and individuals in dealing with pandemic crisis differed between natives and sojourners. The literature argues that migrants (including sojourners) usually feel more insecure and panicked during an infectious disease epidemic. Specifically, the nonsignificant impact of regulatory cues' implies that the gap between institutions and individuals is comparatively high in the case of sojourners. Therefore, the findings imply that effective communication with sojourners can be a future area of concern for researchers, academicians, and policy makers, especially in China, where foreign-attractive reforms are in the early stage. For instance, one of the most constructive measures is the use of a multilingual or multimode communication mix, in which maximum interaction with sojourners becomes possible for institutions during the crisis. In terms of stakeholders' management, the institution's primary responsibility is to mobilize and involve each member of the society to make the crisis management strategy successful and effective.",

            "text": "Moreover, the theoretical implication to embed media and SSE in HBM also stretches the practical implications further. MSE was recorded as the most dominating construct in the overall model and in the case of natives and sojourners separately. Thus, MSE is a critical attribute in any scenario of a crisis control initiative. In recent years, the digital attributes of media allowed the creation of new perspectives of information-seeking and sharing behaviors in society, i.e., the pull architecture of the internet always brings much information to an information seeker. Furthermore, as discussed in Section 3, international and domestic media sources influence information seekers differently during the COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China. Therefore, the current study implies that the efficient and effective use of media by concerned institutions can help communicate information to sojourners and natives in a more digitally smart and effective manner i.e. the use of immersive media in risk communication. The study highlights the critical role of SSE, because it helps conceptualize individuals' risk perception in any emergency crisis. The presence of a science museum in every populous city in China is a part of the national strategy to increase the public's understanding of science and its impact on society. The significance of SSE implies that the use of science communication in a more informal manner during a pandemic is important. Lastly, sojourners are supposed to be ambassadors who can communicate with international entities. Therefore, the gap between the PHR and protective behavior must be minimized to avoid spreading international propaganda.",

The study made a theoretical contribution by addressing the role of media and SSE in healthprotective behavioral intention modeling. Moreover, the role of regulatory and normative cues was also stretched further using the existing HBM. The possible list of future research fronts may include the following: (1) holistic communication strategy in a pandemic, especially in the presence of a communication barrier (i.e., multilingual support); (2) the role of efficacies need to be explored further, because they classify human cognitive abilities, i.e., how self-resilience and cognitive abilities help mitigate the pandemic situation; (3) the nonsignificant impact of regulative cues in sojourners highlights the need to improve sojourners' understanding to distinguish the cues from institutions and society; (4) in terms of the public's understanding of socioscientific issues, the role of SSE should be emphasized and revisited; (5) the role of the trust in technology and in institutions, as well as the social capital in terms of individuals' social networking, should be examined to map sojourners' and natives' health-protective behavioral intentions in routine life and under unique circumstances (i.e., pandemic situation).",
