The involvement of hearing in COVID19 is verified so the timing and methodology of audiological evaluation of children can be planned. Methods: Children were subject to newborn hearing screening and audiological evaluation. Newborn hearing screening is carried out prior to hospital discharge using the Automatic Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions test. Audiological evaluation is performed within the child age of 4 months by using maternal, pregnancy, and perinatal case history, COVID19 case history, otoscopy, acoustic immittance test, Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions test, and the Auditory Brainstem Response test. Results: 63 children were included in the study. 82.5% of these children were subjects of the newborn hearing screening program. The remaining 11 newborns were not subjected to hearing screening due to isolation measures and their audiological evaluation was carried out directly. Only one of 52 screened neonates showed a bilateral REFER test result but hearing threshold was normal at audiological evaluation. Audiological evaluation showed normal bilateral ABR thresholds in 59/63 children. Four children (6.3% of the total) had ABR threshold alterations but two showed normal threshold at ABR retest performed within 1 month of the first. The other two infants showed monolateral ABR alterations but one of these had a concomitant middle ear effusion. In conclusion, only one child (1.6% of the sample) had an altered ABR. This child had shown one positive SARS-CoV-2 swab in the absence of risk factors for hearing loss. Conclusion: This study finds no evidence that maternal COVID19 infection is a risk factor in the development of congenital hearing loss in newborns.",

In the study presented in this paper the children performed both TEOAE and DPOAE but in two different moments of their life (TEAOE prior to hospital discharge and DPOAE within the child age of 4 months). In contrast to Celik and colleagues, the authors of the present study did not find any alterations in both of the tests. It is not possible to compare the result of the study presented in this paper with those of Celik group because the latter study does not state the age when the infants were evaluated.",
