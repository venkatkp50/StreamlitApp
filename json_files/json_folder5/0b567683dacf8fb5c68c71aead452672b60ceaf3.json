            "text": "| DNA nanotechnology has progressed from proof-of-concept demonstrations of structural design towards application-oriented research. As a natural material with excellent self-assembling properties, DNA is an indomitable choice for various biological applications, including biosensing, cell modulation, bioimaging and drug delivery. However, a major impediment to the use of DNA nanostructures in biological applications is their susceptibility to attack by nucleases present in the physiological environment. Although several DNA nanostructures show enhanced resistance to nuclease attack compared with duplexes and plasmid DNA, this may be inadequate for practical application. Recently, several strategies have been developed to increase the nuclease resistance of DNA nanostructures while retaining their functions, and the stability of various DNA nanostructures has been studied in biological fluids, such as serum, urine and cell lysates. This Review discusses the approaches used to modulate nuclease resistance in DNA nanostructures and provides an overview of the techniques employed to evaluate resistance to degradation and quantify stability.",

            "text": "It has been almost 40 years since Ned Seeman published his thoughts on using DNA as a building block for the assembly of nanostructures, a field now called DNA nanotechnology 1 . Seeman's original vision was to use DNA as a framework to crystallize other hard-to-crystallize macromolecules. Early work on DNA-based construction mostly involved the creation of DNA junctions, motifs and devices [2] [3] [4] , and, over the past four decades, multiple strategies have been developed to create diverse architectures using DNA 5 . The library of DNA nanostructures, ranging from the nanometre to the micrometre scale [6] [7] [8] , now includes geometric patterns 9 , polyhedral objects 10 , nanoscale bunnies 11 , a box with a lid 12 , a cargo-moving assembly line 13 and even a miniature Mona Lisa 14 . More recently, the focus has moved from proof-of-concept construction using DNA towards the applications of these structures. Being a natural material, DNA nanostructures have found the most use in biological applications [15] [16] [17] . Indeed, nanocages built from DNA have been used in drug delivery 18 , reconfigurable DNA devices in biosensing 19 and DNA structures conjugated to fluorophores and ligands for imaging 20 and modulating cellular behaviour 21 . Although each of these applications has specific prerequisites, one common requirement is that the DNA nanostructures should remain stable under physiological conditions and be able to withstand degradation by nucleases.",

For example, in biosensing, DNA nanodevices must remain intact when mixed with samples (typically, biofluids such as blood, serum and urine), as unpredictable and sudden degradation can lead to false signals. In drug delivery, the biostability of DNA nanostructures is important to protect the drug from harsh physiological conditions until it reaches the destination site in the body. In cellular modulation and bioimaging, DNA nanostructures need to remain largely intact in the cellular or bodily environment to complete their functions (to deliver regulating proteins or accumulate at target tissues, respectively). A major reason for degradation of DNA nanostructures in these conditions is the presence of nucleases (enzymes that degrade nucleic acids). To address this issue, strategies have been developed to modulate the biostability of DNA nanostructures and to increase their suitability for biological applications.",

            "text": "Construction using DNA DNA is well known as the carrier of genetic information, but is also a natural nanoscale material. The characteristics of DNA that make it a suitable building block for nanoscale architectures include its nanoscale dimensions, persistence length of ~50 nm (that is, its 'stiffness' for robust construction) and predictable Watson-Crick base pairing, which allows for programmed assembly (Fig. 1a) . Furthermore, multidimensional assembly is possible by creating branched DNA structures that can be connected by short single-stranded extensions (sticky ends) to create larger assemblies. Building using DNA has led to two areas of DNA nanotechnology: structural and dynamic. Structural DNA nanotechnology mainly involves the design and construction of DNA-based structures with different geometries, perio dicity or spatial patterns (Fig. 1b) . Researchers have created various DNA nanostructures using tile-based assembly 35, 36 , DNA origami 37 and DNA brick strategies 38 . In dynamic DNA nanotechnology, DNA structures are designed to reconfigure upon recognition of external moieties, such as nucleic acids 39, 40 , antigens 12, 41 or ligands 40,42 , or in response to environmental changes, including changes in pH 43, 44 , temperature 45 or light 46, 47 (Fig. 1c) . Such stimuli-responsive devices are useful in biosensing and as components for triggered release in drug-delivery carriers. Construction principles for DNA nanostructures, assembly strategies and the types of motifs and structures have been discussed elsewhere 3, 6, 48, 49 .",

The structures tested for each strategy, the analysis technique and the resulting nuclease resistance are compiled in TABle 1. Design and inherent nuclease resistance. The structural design of DNA nanostructures influences the nuclease resistance. DNA tiles and motifs contain multiple strands hybridized together in a tightly woven fashion. Similarly, larger (and more complex) origami structures contain multiple helical domains packed into bundles (arranged in, for example, square or honeycomb lattices) 37, 103 . This close-packed structure in DNA origami and other multi-helix structures is more nuclease resistant than linear duplexes or plasmid DNA 104 (Fig. 3a ). For example, 1 enzyme unit (U) of DNase I completely degraded 65 ng of duplex plasmid DNA (pET24b) in only 5 min, whereas it took ~60 min to degrade 2 ng of a 24-helixbundle DNA origami structure 104 . This result indicates the potential of multilayer DNA origami objects as encapsulation agents for use with intercalating drugs, for example. However, DNA nanostructures are required to be hollow to encapsulate cargos such as nanoparticles and proteins. Hollow wireframe structures, such as DNA tetrahedra 105 , have also shown higher stability in 10% FBS (up to 42 h) than linear duplexes, possibly owing to their non-native geometries. The influence of molecular topology on nuclease resistance has also been noted 106 : a reconfigurable DNA device based on DNA tweezers 107 was more nuclease resistant in the closed state than in the open state (~37 h versus 20 h in 70% human serum, respectively), possibly owing to the stacking of two helices side by side in the closed state 106 (Fig. 3b) .",

One approach is to expose the samples to conditions that denature the nucleases. For example, DNA origami nanostructures (an octahedron, nanotube and nanorod) incubated in RPMI cell culture medium supplemented with 10% FBS degraded completely within 24 h (reF. 109 ). By contrast, heating the FBS to 75 \u00b0C for 10 min before addition to the cell culture medium prolonged the nanostructure lifetime in the medium (with almost no degradation), owing to the inactivation of nucleases in the serum (Fig. 4a) . However, heating the FBS might also have a more general effect on serum proteins, which could affect cell growth and phenotype. Nuclease inhibitors can also be used to reduce the effect of nucleases in solution. For example, the addition of a tenfold molar excess of actin, a known nuclease inhibitor, extended the lifetime of DNA nanostructures against DNase I (reF. 109 ) (Fig. 4b) . In contrast to heat treatment of FBS, which is incompatible with in vitro tissue culture, inclusion of actin (up to 200 nM) had no observable effect on cell growth and viability. In other cases, compounds that restrict access to the minor groove of double-stranded DNA can competitively inhibit DNase I activity (Fig. 4c) . In a study reported in a recent preprint article, the efficiency of different classes of minor-groove binders on reducing the nuclease degradation of wireframe DNA origami structures (a two-helix pentagonal bipyramid) was tested 110 . Diamine 2-(4-amidinophenyl)-1H-indole-6-carboxamidine (DAPI) was the most potent stabilizer, increasing the protection of structures in 10% mouse serum to 24 h, compared with the 3-h stability of native structures.",

Reducing the number of free termini by enzymatic ligation was effective in enhancing the nuclease resistance of DNA tetrahedra 105 and prisms 113 , increasing the mean lifetime of these structures to ~42 h and ~200 h, respectively, in 10% FBS (Fig. 5a) . Crosslinking the helices within nanostructures by azide-alkyne click reactions has also helped DNA nanostructures to withstand nuclease degradation 114 (Fig. 5b ). Crosslinked DNA nanotubes had greater protection against exonuclease I compared with native structures. In another example, thymidines were positioned in close proximity within DNA origami nanostructures and crosslinked using ultraviolet light, leading to the site-specific formation of covalent bonds and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers 115 (Fig. 5c ). The additional covalent bonds increased the lifetime of the nanostructures from 10 min (for native structures) to 60 min in the presence of 0.4 U ml \u22121 DNase I. In addition to post-assembly modifications, the inherent stability of nanostructures can be increased by modifying the DNA backbone and nucleobases of component strands. In one example, DNA strand termini were functionalized with hexaethylene glycol and hexanediol groups, and then used in building DNA prisms 113, 116 (Fig. 5d) . These structures had a lifetime of 55-62 h in FBS-supplemented culture medium, whereas the unmodified native DNA nanostructures degraded in less than 18 h. Another route to enhancing nuclease resistance is by using modified DNA as the component strands for assembly. Two-dimensional DNA arrays and a DNA tetrahedron built using l-DNA were more resistant to nucleases than their d-DNA (that is, regular right-handed DNA) counterparts 117 (Fig. 5e ). The l-DNA structures remained almost fully intact after treatment with exonuclease I and exonuclease III for 45 min, whereas the native structures fully degraded. In another study, six-arm junctions containing unnatural DNA base pairs (2-thiothymidine:A and 5-methyl-isocytidine:isoG) were only partially digested by T7 exonuclease after 12 h, whereas the unmodified junction completely degraded 118 (Fig. 5f ). In the context of chemical modifications, a less-explored option is the incorporation of 2\u00b4-5\u00b4-linked oligonucleotides into nucleic acid nanostructures to enhance resistance against ribonucleases 119 .",

Furthermore, conjugating PEG to these oligolysines 124 (Fig. 6e) or crosslinking the oligolysine-PEG coating using glutaraldehyde 125 (Fig. 6f) further increased the nuclease resistance of these nanostructures to ~36 h in culture medium and ~66 h in 1 U \u00b5l \u22121 of DNase I, respectively.

Typically, nanostructures are incubated for different times with nucleases or serum (or with different concentrations of these), and the incubated samples run on PAGE or AGE.

Upon degradation of DNA nanostructures conjugated to fluorescent dyes, the fluorophore and the quencher (or the FRET pair) separate, causing an increase in fluorescence levels (Fig. 7b) . This increase can be monitored over time to study the degradation kinetics of DNA nanostructures. Gel electrophoresis and fluorescence techniques provide information on the degradation levels of nanostructures but do not provide information on structural changes. To obtain such structural information, TEM and AFM are used to provide before and after snapshots of DNA nanostructures incubated with body fluids or nucleases 111, 132 (Fig. 7c,d) .

Depending on the type of nuclease used, different parameters, such as DNA sequence, backbone geometry, groove width, curvature and flexibility, can all contribute to nuclease resistance 134 . For DNA nanostructures, the non-native geometries and sizes could have a role in inhibiting enzyme binding, thus decreasing the efficiency of specific or non-specific enzymatic cleavage 105 . Close-packed helices and frequent crossovers in DNA nanostructures can also occlude enzyme binding, thus negating the effect of nucleases 92, 133 . Furthermore, nucleases such as DNase I cause distortion on binding to helices 135 , and, thus, the increased stiffness of shorter duplex regions or multi-helical edges within DNA nanostructures might prevent the binding of such enzymes. In the case of different modifications and coatings, strong multivalent interactions of the envelope with the DNA could hinder nuclease adsorption and, thus, reduce the degradation. In DNA origami, the scaffold strand already contains restriction sites. In a study on 2D structures, such as a DNA triangle and rectangle, the position of the restriction site post-folding and the introduction of defects (missing staple strands) affected the overall activity of restriction endonuclease on the structures 136 . In a follow-up computational study, global conformational fluctuations between metastable states of DNA origami structures were shown to affect the reactivity of restriction endonucleases on the structures 137 . Simulations of a 2D DNA origami triangle with four or eight staple Peptoid Small protein-like polymer in which the side chains are attached to backbone nitrogen atoms, rather than to the \u03b1-carbons, as in peptides. strands omitted from the structure, each resulting in a metastable assembly, revealed that the accessibility of the enzyme to the structure is dependent on the interconversion between these metastable states.

Given this requirement, one has to choose a strategy for modulating the nuclease resistance of a DNA nanostructure on the basis of the design of the underlying DNA assembly. For example, DNA prisms in which the strand termini contained hexaethylene glycol and hexanediol groups showed enhanced nuclease resistance 113, 116 , but the same strategy applied to a larger wireframe DNA origami pentagonal bipyramid did not further stabilize the structure in 10% FBS 110 . Although there is no general set of rules to make this choice, some studies have noted how the stability numbers reported could apply to similar structures. In DNA origami, most structures share a common scaffold strand (M13) and, thus, have similar GC content if completely double-stranded, eliminating sequence as a factor in stability variations. Therefore, the difference in stability arises from the design of the nanostructures, how closely the helical bundles are packed and the length of the staple strands 104 . Even if the stability reported for an origami structure is not representative for objects built with similar specifications, these results could be useful in designing new objects with an expected robustness. In designing other structures, adapting the edges to be multi-helical domains might increase the persistence length of the wireframe structures and, thus, provide additional stability.",

In two studies, enzymes such as exonuclease VIII, lambda exonuclease, Mse I restriction endonuclease and T7 exonuclease did not have any effect on DNA origami objects, whereas DNase I, Escherichia coli exonuclease I, exonuclease T, T7 endonuclease and exonuclease III degraded them 104, 115 . Similarly, PX DNA showed different levels of resistance to DNase I, exonuclease V, T7 exonuclease and T5 exonuclease; however, PX DNA displayed much higher nuclease resistance than DX or duplex structures in all cases 92 . Thus, although generic trends exist, the activity of different nucleases could differ. The concentration of nucleases tested is also an important factor in determining the extent of degradation. Through calibration of the nuclease levels in FBS by comparing DNA origami nanostructures incubated in 1-20% FBS and different concentrations of DNase I, it was estimated that typical tissue culture conditions may contain between 256 and 1,024 U l \u22121 equivalent of DNase I activity 109 .

The level of nuclease activity in different FBS lots and frozen aliquots has been observed to vary 109 . In this report, the nuclease activity was highest after initial thawing of the FBS and was lost after a few weeks when FBS-supplemented medium was stored at 4 \u00b0C (reF. 109 ). Thus, it is important to follow the specific reagent-handling protocol across multiple experiments to validate the nuclease-resistance values of different structures. Nuclease activity in body fluids also varies widely between species 138, 139 , and studies on DNA nanostructures have also found the stability of nanostructures to vary in sera from different species 110 . Future studies could work with human-derived solutions instead of animal sera to make the results more relevant for human applications.",

In drug delivery, partial digestion of DNA nanostructures could trigger release of the drug cargo or attached functional moieties (such as fluorophores for tracking). However, slow or delayed degradation of nanostructures could be useful in the spontaneous release of drugs. The addition of nuclease inhibitors or the heat treatment of samples are potential options for biosensing applications in which the sample can be preprocessed before addition of the DNA sensor. However, use of DNA nanostructures in vivo requires strategies that obviate the need to alter the environment, as the addition of external factors might influence other biomolecular processes. Furthermore, the choice of strategy will also depend on the type of biofluid the structu res will be in (blood, urine, saliva), and prior knowledge of the types of nucleases present in these fluids and their levels will be useful in biostability studies. Once the stabilization strategy is chosen, it is imperative to test the functionality of these structures after the protection process; chemical modifications or coatings should not affect the binding of sensing elements or targeting moieties to DNA nanostructures. For example, the peptoid coating of DNA origami structures did not affect the encapsulation of cargos such as proteins and nanoparticles within the nanostructure, suggesting potential use in drug delivery 128 . In addition, polyplex micelles comprising cationic polysaccharides have been successfully used to stabilize plasmid DNA for gene therapy 140 , indicating the potential use of similarly stabilized DNA nanostructures.",

When used as drug carriers, the immune response elicited by intact and degraded nanostructures might differ in some cases, whereas in others, it might be dependent on the total mass of DNA and not the design or integrity of the nanostructures 109 . Thus, care has to be taken to test the intactness of DNA nanostructures in studies in which the specific immune response is important. For example, the oligolysine-PEG block copolymer coating of DNA nanostructures had negligible effect on cell viability or enzyme kinetics, indicating minimal immune response in the cells 125, 141 . Studies to test in vivo stability and immune response might also require additional functionalities to track the nanostructure through the body or a cellular pathway, and can use newly developed techniques, such as a 'hydroporator' , to deliver DNA nanostructures directly into cells for monitoring 142 .",

From these studies, it is apparent that DNA nanostructures possess higher nuclease resistance than duplexes, and that all the strategies discussed can enhance this resistance. However, it is difficult to further compare results from these studies, as they report results using different metrics (lifetime, half-life, percentage intact) and use different nanostructures. To facilitate comparison, the DNA nanotechnology research community is encouraged to decide on a set of standardized reporting parameters for nuclease resistance and biostability. Such a system would benefit the generalization of design parameters and the choice of strategy for a specific structure and/or application. Future studies could also explore the effect of the shape and size of DNA nanostructures on nuclease resistance, reports on which are few.",
