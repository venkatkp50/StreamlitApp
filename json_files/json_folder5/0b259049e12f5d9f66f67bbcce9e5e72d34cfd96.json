The global incidence ranges from 5 to 500 new cases per 100 000 inhabitants/year, with a global average of 130 new cases per 100 000 inhabitants/year [1] . Since 2015, tuberculosis has become the leading cause of death from infectious diseases, with 1.5 million deaths recorded in 2018 [1] . Diabetes, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, smoking, overconsumption of alcohol and undernutrition are the main risk factors associated with the new cases of tuberculosis. Tuberculosis mainly affects vulnerable populations, making precariousness, promiscuity and migration the major risk factors in many regions [1] [2] [3] . Nevertheless, tuberculosis remains a curable and preventable infectious disease. The fight against tuberculosis worldwide since the 2000s has saved 58 million people [1] .",

In this case, we report a rare fistulized form of tuberculosis with pseudotumoral appearance. The fistula is located in the middle third of the esophagus opposite the carina, originating from the necrotic pseudotumoral tuberculosis lesion of the left bronchus, due to an endobronchial perforation towards the esophagus, without radiological aspect of necrotic lymph node. There was no tuberculosis involvement of the esophageal mucosa and as far as the origin of this fistula is concerned, there was no necrotic lymphadenopathy or mediastinal involvement found. Fig. 3 . Chest CT scan. Fig. 3a shows the appearance of centrilobular micro-nodules (Tree-in-bud sign) in the lingula and left lower lobe. Fig. 2b shows the pulmonary consolidation of the right middle lobe.
