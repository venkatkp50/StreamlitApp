For example, the number of confirmed cases largely underestimates the number of infections, and deaths lag infections substantially, while test positivity rates tend to greatly overestimate prevalence. Representative random prevalence surveys, the only putatively unbiased source, are sparse in time and space, and the results can come with big delays. Reliable estimates of population prevalence are necessary for understanding the spread of the virus and the effectiveness of mitigation strategies. We develop a simple Bayesian framework to estimate viral prevalence by combining several of the main available data sources. It is based on a discrete-time Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model with time-varying reproductive parameter. Our model includes likelihood components that incorporate data on deaths due to the virus, confirmed cases, and the number of tests administered on each day. We anchor our inference with data from randomsample testing surveys in Indiana and Ohio. We use the results from these two states to calibrate the model on positive test counts and proceed to estimate the infection fatality rate and the number of new infections on each day in each state in the United States. We estimate the extent to which reported COVID cases have underestimated true infection counts, which was large, especially in the first months of the pandemic. We explore the implications of our results for progress toward herd immunity.",

Lack of access to viral tests, which was particularly pronounced in the early days of the pandemic, in conjunction with selection bias due to asymptomatic and mild infections, yield case counts that tend to underestimate the true number of infections in the population. By the same token, test positivity rates tend to overestimate viral prevalence. Hospitalization rates and emergency room visits do not estimate the overall infection rate and are not comparable between states or counties, or over time. Reported deaths due to COVID are considered less problematic as an estimate of the true death count and provide a more accurate reflection of the course of the pandemic (1) .",

Nationwide, over 600,000 have died in the COVID-19 pandemic, which has necessitated shutdowns of schools and sectors of the economy. The extent of the virus' spread remains uncertain due to biases in test data. We combine multiple data sources to estimate the true number of infections in all US states. These data include representative random testing surveys from Indiana and Ohio, which provide potentially unbiased prevalence estimates.

A possible explanation for this trend is the public and governmental response to deviations of r (t) from one. As r (t) exceeds one and cases rise, lockdowns and other nonpharmaceutical interventions may be implemented to contain the virus; as r (t) drops below one and cases dwindle, businesses, such as bars and restaurants, may be allowed to reopen, causing r (t) to increase. When fitting the model in time periods for which we have data, we assumed instead that r (t) follows a random walk, as described in Materials and Methods. This process works well for estimation, but the variance can increase too much if used for projection beyond the short-term. The stochastic AR model captures future uncertainty in r (t) more accurately. We also estimate the autocorrelation and variance parameters of the AR(1) model from the sampled trajectories of r (t).",

We present estimates of the IFR and the time-varying viral prevalence and reproductive number r (t) in each US state on each day. Our results indicate that a large majority of COVID infections go unreported.

Active viral prevalence in Indiana in the period April 25 to 29, 2020, was estimated as\u03b8v = 1.74%. We model this quantity using a nor- The sampled population consisted of all noninstitutionalized Indiana residents aged \u2265 12 years listed on state tax returns, including filers and dependents. Stratified random sampling was conducted by using Indiana's 10 public health preparedness districts as sampling strata, and 15,495 participants were contacted by the state health department. Of those contacted, 3,658, or 23.6%, agreed to participate in the study. While low, this response rate is not far from the survey industry average of 30% (22, 23) . Menachemi et al. (3) note that respondents might have been subject to response bias, which could have resulted in underestimates or overestimates. To adjust for differences in nonresponse between groups, data were weighted for age, race, and Hispanic ethnicity. Participants were tested for active infection via RT-PCR and past infection via antibody test between April 25 and April 29, 2020. The RT-PCR tests used had high, but imperfect, sensitivity, and the antibody tests had high, but imperfect, specificity. The former could have caused false-negative results and the latter false-positive results. In a follow-up paper published in PNAS, Yiannoutsos et al. (24) conducted a Bayesian analysis of the Indiana survey data to address uncertainty in the results related to imperfect testing and difference in prevalence among subgroups characterized by ethnicity, race, and age. Due to very low response rates-less than 8% in the second and third phases-we do not include data from the subsequent phases of the Indiana study in our analysis.",

            "text": "The likelihood for the prevalence survey data from Ohio is analogous. The survey design was a stratified two-stage cluster sample, with strata defined by eight administrative regions in the state of Ohio. Within each region, 30 census tracts were randomly selected with probability proportional to total population. Within each tract, households were randomly sampled, and one adult within each household was randomly selected to participate in the study. Of those contacted, 727, or 18.5%, agreed to participate. Between July 9 and July 28, 2020, participants were tested for active and past infection via RT-PCR and antibody test. Due to the low response rate and imperfect diagnostic tests used in the study, the same caveats described above for the Indiana survey apply. Kline et al. (4) conducted a Bayesian analysis of the seroprevalence survey data to address the uncertainty in the results associated with nonresponse and imperfect testing. As reported in ref. 4 , the estimated seroprevalence in the state was\u03b8s = 1.3% in the period July 9 to 28, with a sample size of ns = 667. Results from the PCR tests in the same study were reported in a press conference on October 1 available on YouTube (ref. (25) , minute 22). The viral prevalence in that period is estimated as\u03b8v = 0.9% with sample size nv = 727. To the best of our knowledge, these numbers have not yet been published. Figs. 1 and 2 , the undercount curve (It + Rt)/( k\u2264t C k ) has a common shape in Indiana and Ohio. Here, It and Rt are the SIR parameters on day t, and Ct is the total number of confirmed and probable cases, defined as unique people with a positive PCR or other approved nucleic acid amplification test in the state on day t, as reported by the COVID Tracking Project (2) . We found that the reciprocal of the undercount is approximately linear when plotted against the square root of the cumulative number of tests administered in the state on each day and that the slopes of these lines for the two states are similar; Fig. 5 . This led to the following model for the test data:",

Here, Tt is the number of total test results in the state on day t, as reported by the COVID Tracking Project (2) . Due to variation in test-reporting methods across states, this number may include antigen tests as well as viral (PCR) tests. Moreover, different states report total tests using different units, whether in terms of test encounters, test specimens, or unique people tested. As such, Tt is best understood as an estimate of the state's test capacity. This is the extent to which it is used in our preferential testing model.

We refer to the normal means in [2] and [3] (divided by the parameter \u03c6) as the cumulative and marginal regression functions, respectively. \u03b1 > 0 is a parameter representing the degree of preferential testing. Assuming the infection rate is small, a binomial expansion of the test positivity rate yields the approximation 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 It/N) \u03b1 \u2248 \u03b1It/N. An application of Bayes' rule to the latter model shows that \u03b1 = P(tested|infected)/P(tested). This model has some limitations in the context of our study. Firstly, the degree of preferential testing \u03b1 is likely to decrease as testing increases, and it is not obvious how one might parametrize \u03b1 = \u03b1t to account for this. Secondly, the model is not additive, as the test positivity relies on the active infection rate.

They take the form \u03bdt = Ct[m \u00b7 (Ct/Tt) k + b], where m > 0, k \u2208 [0, 1], b \u2265 0 are parameters. Benatia et al. (29) also estimate population prevalence on day t by the number of positive tests on day t scaled by a multiplicative factor depending on the number of tests administered on day t as a fraction of the state population. These models are susceptible to the same issues as that of Campbell et al. (26) . They rely on daily test positivity rates, which are reported inconsistently across states (30) . And as Youyang Gu (27) notes, the parameters estimated at one point in time do not carry over to other time periods. Furthermore, by assuming that new infections are a function only of cases and tests on that day, these models ignore the lag between infections and their confirmation via testing. They also presume that there are no new infections on days in which no positive tests are reported. Our likelihood on cases in Eq. 3 allows for new infections to be reflected in case counts at a later date. Note that our model does not take into account imperfect testing. Modeling imperfect testing is complicated by the inconsistent test-reporting methods across states described above, which obscure the true number of PCR tests administered in a state on each day. Given that estimated active infection rates are generally low (< 5%) at any given time, imperfect test specificity (i.e., the proportion of true negative results) is a greater potential source of bias in case counts Ct than sensitivity. False positives resulting from imperfect specificity would increase Ct. We note, however, that the molecular RT-PCR assays widely deployed to test for the presence of viral RNA are shown to have near perfect specificity (31) (32) (33) (34) .",

We then used the posterior distribution from Ohio as the prior distribution for the remaining states, each of which we modeled independently. The prior distributions of the remaining parameters are diffuse independent uniform priors. Their exact forms are provided in SI Appendix. To estimate \u03c6, we used the same process as described for \u03b3.",
