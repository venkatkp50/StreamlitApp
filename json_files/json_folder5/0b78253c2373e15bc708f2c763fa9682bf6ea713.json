Consequently, the burden of thromboembolic events, heart failure, bleeding and other major implications may arise. Health care resources must adapt to large-scale early diagnosis and individualized state-of-the-art treatment. To comply with it, the European Society of Cardiology upgraded the recommendation class for systematic electrocardiography (ECG) screening to detect AF in individuals aged \u226575 years, or those at high risk of stroke from 'may be considered' (class IIb) to 'should be considered' (class IIa) (2) . Opportunistic screening for AF by pulse taking or ECG rhythm strip in patients \u226565 years of age remains 'recommended' (class I). The problem of insufficient examination for AF is also relevant to secondary prevention. As revealed by an international survey, in 40% of European countries only conventional ECG without long-term cardiac monitoring is the most common method to exclude AF after transient ischemic attack (3) .",

The automatic PPG-based algorithm indicates whether AF is suspected as described previously (11, 12) . An embedded PPG sensor uses a green light-emitting diode and a photodetector to continuously measure changes in blood flow. The algorithm relies on the analysis of peak-to-peak intervals, extracted using an adaptive threshold for peak detection. The AF detector has several solutions to reduce the false alarm rate, including filtering of ectopic beats, bigeminy suppression, sinus arrhythmia suppression and continuous signal quality assessment. The latter analyses each detected PPG pulse, identifies artifacts and enables reliable long-term monitoring for AF. The algorithm for AF detection is flexible with respect to the briefest duration of possible AF episode (12) . In this study, the algorithm was tuned to detect as short AF episodes as 30 s, accounting to the clinical definition of the minimal duration of paroxysmal AF. Therefore, the PPG-based algorithm triggers the AF alarm after an average duration of 30 s in AF if the condition of sufficient signal quality index is met (11) . It should be noted that the duration from the onset of AF to the alarm may vary depending on the heart rate irregularity. That is, the alarm can be triggered as soon as after 5 s in case of highly irregular AF, but no later than after 1 min in case of AF with very low irregularity of heartbeats. Once the PPG-based algorithm detects a possible AF episode, it triggers a vibration alarm for the user.",

As presented in detail (Figure 3 ), we excluded 15 subjects due to logistical errors (duplicates or missing data files). After the initial analysis of PPG tracings, 8 patients were excluded due to missing PPG signals and 13 due to insufficient PPG quality. Regarding the wearable ECG method, we excluded 11 subjects due to missing ECG signals and 43 due to insufficient ECG quality. One patient was excluded due to typical atrial flutter instead of AF. Therefore, the final sample size constituted 344 patients. Our analysis included 121 patients with AF, predominantly paroxysmal, 95 patients with stable SR and 128 patients with SR and frequent premature contractions ( Table 1) . The latter group consisted of individuals with dominant PVCs (n = 88) or PACs (n = 40). To meet a threshold for a sufficient frequency of at least one extrasystole per 2 min, a Holter ECG of validated device was thoroughly examined. The real burden of PVCs/PACs exceeded the threshold to a large extent and comprised a median of 6.2 (16.1-2.8) premature beats per minute. Importantly, almost a quarter of this group (31/128, 24.2%) had episodes of bigeminy or trigeminy and almost a one-tenth (12/128, 9.4%) had runs of \u22653 PACs/PVCs which were often irregular (Figure 4) . The mentioned arrhythmogenicity parameters reflect the significant pressure we have put on both the PPG algorithm and the ECG of the device to differentiate between SR and AF.",

            "text": "The PPG-based AF detection algorithms are increasingly used in wearables and apps. However, there is a lack of device validation studies that comprehensively test the algorithms on patients with frequent premature contractions. Choosing a stable SR control group underrepresents real-world settings. Subsequently, some physicians express a low trust in the specificity of wearables in daily practice. It may contribute to denying reimbursement of wearable diagnostics, reported in a recent survey by as much as 36% (194/539) of respondents worldwide (14) . Therefore, we dedicated a distinct control group and reported a comprehensive analysis of premature contractions as beats per minute, cases with frequent runs of PACs/PVCs or bigeminy/trigeminy episodes. To compare different technologies and acquire reproducible results such standard of reporting is highly needed. One of our key findings is that frequent PVCs/PACs reduce the specificity of the PPG-based AF detection algorithm as all seven false-positive cases were from this group in contrast to none from the stable SR group. The authors further investigated what qualitative and quantitative characteristics of premature beats were associated with type I error of the PPG-based algorithm. Interestingly, cases with bigeminy/trigeminy episodes as well as frequent runs of \u22653 PACs/PVCs did not reduce the diagnostic accuracy of the algorithm. Such finding could be explained by a dedicated bigeminy suppression in the algorithm. However, a type I error of the PPG-based algorithm had a tendency to be associated with a higher burden of premature beats per minute (Figure 5) . Frequent premature contractions seem to be a specificity lowering factor for Apple Watch PPG-based notification for irregular rhythm detection. A recent substudy of participants with an irregular pulse notification on the Apple Watch and no AF observed on ECG patch revealed other atrial or ventricular arrhythmias (mostly ectopic beats) in 40% of participants (15) . This is important to acknowledge when applying similar PPGbased apps or devices for wide population research such as Apple Heart Study (5) or TeleCheck-AF project (4) . Even if it is considered a screening measure it may potentially cause harmful effects for an individual with many PVCs/PACs, e.g., unnecessary visits, interventions, anxiety. The authors are strongly convinced that in the field of wearables with a continuous PPG algorithm for the screening of AF, specificity is of critical importance. Since an individual is unobtrusively monitored for a prolonged period FIGURE 6 | Performance of PPG-based algorithm, 6-lead ECG and the system of both methods to detect AF (n = 341). The group of AF is compared to both control SR groups, including patients with frequent PVCs/PACs. PPG, photoplethysmography; ECG, electrocardiography; AF, atrial fibrillation; SR, sinus rhythm; PVC, premature ventricular contraction; PAC, premature atrial contraction. of time, there is a high chance of arrhythmia detection and, thus, novel technologies should be in line with the principle of \"first, do no harm.\"",

            "text": "The effect of premature beats on the ECG-based AF detection was minor in our study. The 6-lead ECG of the wearable significantly reduced type I errors of the PPG-based algorithm. Both falsepositive wearable ECG cases were particular tracings of SR with multiple and irregular runs of PACs. These episodes may arguably represent the initial stage of the development of AF or an undiagnosed conventional AF. The STROKESTOP study group from Karolinska Institute coined the term 'micro-AF' for this phenomenon. By definition, it is a sudden onset of irregular tachycardia with episodes of \u22655 consecutive supraventricular beats and total absence of P-waves, lasting less than 30 s (16) . In a large-scale AF screening study of 7,173 individuals micro-AF was related to a higher risk of AF (HR 4.3; 95% CI 2.7-6.8) and death (HR 2.0; 95% CI 1.1-3.8) (17) . Furthermore, a single false-negative case in our study presented with f-waves which occasionally organized and imitated regularly irregular P-waves. Hence it gave the diagnosis-blinded cardiologists a hard time to differentiate it from SR with PACs. Interestingly, short strips of reference Holter ECG corresponding to these two false-positive and one false-negative cases were also falsely recognized as AF and SR, respectively. Only after thorough examination of long reference Holter ECG tracings cardiologists were able to confirm the diagnosis of these challenging cases. It suggests that diagnostic measures of a 6-lead-ECG of the wearable without any wires could be non-inferior to regular 3-lead Holter ECG recordings.",

Similarly, Gruwez et al. (19) compared detection of AF from a single-lead ECG vs. PPG waveform after manual interpretation by physicians. Despite the small number of participants (n = 30) it was a commendably rare example of a distinguished SR group with extrasystoles. The lone PPG waveform yielded a rather small sensitivity of 88.8% and a specificity of 86.3%. Only after adding tachogram and Poincar\u00e9 plot the PPG-based detection increased the sensitivity to 95.5% (P < 0.001) and the specificity to 92.5% (P < 0.001). Then it did not show any significant difference from the sensitivity and the specificity of single-lead ECG manual interpretation for the detection of AF, 91.2% (P = 0.67) and 93.9% (P = 0.54), respectively. Whether the equivalent outcome would occur after comparing the manual PPG interpretation with the 6-lead ECG of our wearable remains to be investigated. Although the PPG algorithm appears to be a suitable method for screening, current AF guidelines remain restricted to only a standard 12-lead ECG or ECG strip with AF of at least 30 s (including wearable-recorded ECGs) to establish the diagnosis by the physician (2). In our study both methods are predominantly assigned to these two different purposes, i.e., the PPG-based algorithm is assigned for screening of AF and the 6-lead ECG is assigned for rhythm confirmation. Therefore, both methods work synergistically in the wrist-worn device.",

For instance, all the participants in the presented study were White. Diverse skin pigmentation may alter the results of PPG-based AF detection. Predefined groups of patients with AF and SR may hypothetically produce bias. Patients with atrial flutter were beyond the scope of this study and may present with different patterns of the pulse wave, though the wearable 6-lead ECG seems to be a promising diagnostic tool for future investigations in such subjects (Figure 7) . A part of recordings was not analyzed due to presented reasons (Figure 3 ) and may cause additional costs or visits for the patients in real-life conditions. Furthermore, the results were derived from an analysis of short-term in-hospital recordings. Diagnostic measures of the device in outpatient settings may differ. In particular, the quality of PPG has been reported to decrease significantly during most daily activities but has a reasonably good quality for analysis during sleep (21) .
