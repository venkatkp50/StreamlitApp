The receptor plays a vital role in astrocytes, contributing to rapid infection sensing and suppression of viral replication, precluding the spread of virus beyond neurons. The route of TLR3 mobilization culminating in the receptor activation remains unexplained. In this research, we investigated the involvement of various types of endosomes in the regulation of the TLR3 mobility in C8-D1A murine astrocyte cell line. TLR3 was transported rapidly to early EEA1-positive endosomes as well as LAMP1-lysosomes following stimulation with the poly(I:C). Later, TLR3 largely associated with late Rab7-positive endosomes. Twenty-four hours after stimulation, TLR3 co-localized with LAMP1 abundantly in lysosomes of astrocytes. TLR3 interacted with poly(I:C) intracellularly from 1 min to 8 h following cell stimulation. We detected TLR3 on the surface of astrocytes indicating constitutive expression, which increased after poly(I:C) stimulation. Our findings contribute to the understanding of cellular modulation of TLR3 trafficking. Detailed analysis of the TLR3 transportation pathway is an important component in disclosing the fate of the receptor in HSV-infected CNS and may help in the search for rationale therapeutics to control the replication of neuropathic viruses.",

In response to brain injury, neuroinflammation or neurodegeneration, numerous concomitant astrocytic processes lead to a condition called reactive astrogliosis (Str\u00f6mberg et al., 1986) . Notably, the spectrum of changes during astrogliosis significantly depends on a variety of divergent signaling events that are conditioned both by nature and severity of the CNS abnormality (Sofroniew, 2015) . During CNS insult such as herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) viral, reactive astrocytes actively participate in the inflammatory response and secrete various cytokines and chemokines, such as TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IL-8, and CXCL10, which significantly affect both initiation and/or progression of the inflammation in CNS (Park et al., 2006) .",

            "text": "The role of astrocytes infection has been studied in various models to support the notion that these cells affect the location, duration and extent of the neuroinflammation in the brain (Cekanaviciute and Buckwalter, 2016) . However, more careful research of neurological disease models needs to be implemented further to unravel the complexity of the astrocytic functions in the brain. In the course of viral dsRNA-mediated inflammation, IFN-\u03b2 produced by astrocytes may induce anti-inflammatory responses and comprehensively regulate the activation of innate and adaptive immune cells (Park et al., 2006; Bol\u00edvar et al., 2018) . During CNS disease such as multiple sclerosis (MS), therapeutically administered IFN-\u03b2 alleviates excess inflammation through a pleiotropic effect on the immune system (Kasper and Reder, 2014) . In light of the \"cytokine storm\" phenomenon, e.g., during COVID-19 infection with upraised magnitude and range of cytokines and chemokines, it is possible that pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) activate and modulate innate responses by affecting the expression of IFN-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 genes as well as IFN-stimulated genes. However, due to high production of pro-inflammatory cytokines during COVID-19, the anti-inflammatory effect of IFNs may be overshadowed, and in that case leading dysfunction in the CNS (Acharya et al., 2020; Yesilkaya and Balcioglu, 2020) . By engaging viral dsRNA, toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) triggers type I IFN signaling which may play a protective role in the CNS during HSV infection and balance the cytokine and chemokine production during HSE. TLR3 ligands are used as adjuvants in vaccines due to high receptor expression in human and murine dendritic cells (Perales-Linares and Navas-Martin, 2013) . However, cytokine signaling pathway redundancy may also be observed with respect to TLR3 activation and data are varying regarding TLR3 role in protective immunity during other viral infections. Therefore, TLR3 contribution to astrogliosis development, cytokine production and subjugation of the inflammatory state during HSE presents an interesting topic of concern and constitutes a target for potential immunotherapies.",

It is a severe disease of high morbidity and mortality and often leads to lifelong neurological deficiencies. HSE is caused by primary or recurrent infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 or type 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2), which establish latency in sensory neurons belonging to the trigeminal ganglion (TG), and possibly in the CNS (Baringer and Pisani, 1994; Held and Derfuss, 2011) . HSV-1 or HSV-2 enter the CNS via the trigeminal or olfactory tract, by hematogenous spread, or by axonal spread following peripheral viral reactivation (Gnann and Whitley, 2017) . The protective response during HSV infection in the brain is dependent on the induction of interferon through Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) activation. However, recent discoveries show that deficiency of TLR3 or TLR3 signaling pathway genes is associated with HSE among children and adults (Zhang et al., 2007; Lim et al., 2014; M\u00f8rk et al., 2015; Sironi et al., 2017) .",

            "text": "Toll-like receptor 3 senses microbial double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), leading to up-regulation of the signaling cascade that results in inflammatory response in the form of cytokines and chemokines such as type I IFNs, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, CXCL-8, and CXCL-10 (Alexopoulou et al., 2001) . Successively, these molecules and type I IFNs in particular, stimulate natural killer cells, control promotion of dendritic cells (DCs) maturation and enhance CD8 + T cell responses (Cheng and Xu, 2010) . Extracellular dsRNA molecules bind to specific uptake receptors on the cell surface and undergo endocytosis, a process mediated by Raftlin, in a clathrin-dependent manner to eventually anchor in endosomes or lysosomes and initiate immune responses (Tatematsu et al., 2018) . Prior to ligand recognition, TLR3 is synthesized and resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Similar to other nucleic acid-sensing TLRs such as TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9, TLR3 requires UNC93B1 to exit the ER in vesicles coated in cytoplasmic coat protein II (COPII) complex, and to be further transported (Brinkmann et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2013) . Newly synthesized receptor is trafficked to Golgi and localizes intracellularly in endosomes or lysosomes, where it undergoes proteolytic treatment and presumably recognizes dsRNA (Garcia-Cattaneo et al., 2012) . There is a possibility that TLR3 residing in endosomes is not recruited through the Golgi apparatus, but directly from the ER (Johnsen et al., 2006) . Endosomal sorting complex required for transportation-0 (ESCRT-0) has been implicated to control the endosomal pathway of TLR7 and TLR9 (Lee and Barton, 2014) . Recently, our research has reported that Hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (Hrs), component of the ESCRT-0, directly interacts with TLR3. Furthermore, both Hrs and Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), a protein that phosphorylates Hrs, affect the potency of TLR3-mediated antiviral response (Mielcarska et al., 2019) . The presence of TLR3 has been confirmed in various subpopulations of endosomes marked with EEA1 and Rab5 (endosomes formed from the plasma membrane), Rab11 (recycling endosomes), Rab7 (mature endosomes), and LAMP1 (endosomes destined to fuse with lysosomes) (Qi et al., 2012) . However, types of endosomes in which TLR3 appears, as well as the temporal dependency of the TLR3 presence in certain intracellular compartment following dsRNA stimulation of astrocytes remain to be elucidated. Importantly, TLR3 residence in different types of endosomes is diversified depending on the type of tissues, cells, and time that has elapsed since the receptor stimulation. It is also uncertain whether TLR3 is constitutively found in the dsRNA recognition site or whether it is transferred to endosomes to encounter nucleic acid as a consequence of cell stimulation. While this issue awaits experimental proof, it is very likely that proper distribution of TLR3 in the specific type of cell, and precise delivery of the receptor to the ligand recognition site is indispensable for the initiation of rapid and effective antiviral response.",

In the present study, we applied confocal microscopy examination and confirmed the presence of TLR3 in early and late endosomes as well as lysosomes, identified by EEA1, Rab7 and LAMP1 markers, respectively. Furthermore, we examined expression levels for each of the endosomal markers, following poly(I:C) stimulation of astrocytes. Lastly, because in certain cell types TLR3 can perform its functions in both endosomes and plasma membrane, we showed TLR3 occurrence on the surface of astrocytes at rest, as well as after stimulation with poly(I:C).",

Unlike naked poly(I:C), transfected poly(I:C)/LyoVec stimulates cytosolic RIG-I and MDA-5 receptors and was used as a control (1 \u00b5g/ml). To control for the effect of LyoVec-mediated membrane solubilization or interactions of the vehicle with cellular compartments on the differential changes in the protein expression observed following cell stimulation with poly(I:C) instead of poly(I:C)/LyoVec, C8-D1A astrocytes were stimulated with LyoVec (1 \u00b5g/ml).

However, clear understanding of the cellular compartment(s) where the interaction of TLR3 and its agonist take place is not available. In the previous studies we determined the TLR3 expression level in C8-D1A cells and demonstrated that, upon poly(I:C) stimulation, TLR3 protein was upregulated (Mielcarska et al., 2019) . Early and late endosomes, as well as lysosomes, may be involved in the TLR3 transportation pathway following the addition of the TLR3 ligand. The innate immune system senses foreign dsRNA in at least two different ways, the TLR3 pathway detects dsRNA in endosomes, while RIG-I and MDA5 receptors recognize dsRNA localized in the cytoplasm (Gitlin et al., 2006) . Therefore, as a control we used synthetic dsRNA complexed with the transfection reagent, cationic lipid LyoVec. Unlike naked poly(I:C), transfected poly(I:C)/LyoVec is sensed only by cytosolic RIG-I and MDA5. Poly(I:C) and poly(I:C)/LyoVec were broadly used in research as the activators of dsRNA signaling pathways (Katashiba et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2012; Qian et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2013; Ohta et al., 2014; Dauletbaev et al., 2015 Dauletbaev et al., , 2017 Mielcarska et al., 2019; Singaravelu et al., 2019) . To shed light on the possible site of TLR3 interaction with ligand, we first investigated the expression levels of marker proteins for the selected types of endosomes -EEA1 for early endosomes, Rab7 for late endosomes, and LAMP1 for lysosomes. We treated astrocytes with poly(I:C) or poly(I:C)/LyoVec at different concentrations or for various time intervals and performed western blot analysis with the appropriate antibodies.",

            "text": "Stimulation of murine astrocytes with the TLR3 agonist resulted in a continuous decrease in EEA1, whereas the expression of Rab7 increased significantly until 4-8 h after poly(I:C) stimulation and then returned to baseline ( Figure 1A) . Interestingly, after 1 h of poly(I:C) stimulation, LAMP1 increased its expression by 47.8 \u00b1 3.13% ( Figure 1A ) and generally showed a statistically significant increase of expression. In C8-D1A cells, nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB was already observed at 8-12 min following stimulation with the TLR3 ligand (Mielcarska et al., 2019) , therefore, such a result may indicate a role for LAMP1-expressing endosomes such as late endosomes and lysosomes in mounting TLR3-mediated inflammatory response in astrocytes. As shown in Figure 1B , poly(I:C) treatment resulted in the increase of EEA1 and LAMP1 expression in a concentration-dependent manner, while the increase in Rab7 expression was observed with increasing concentrations of poly(I:C)/LyoVec ( Figure 1D ). After treatment of C8-D1A cells with poly(I:C)/LyoVec, the expression of EEA1 and LAMP1 decreased, which may be indicative of different cellular events during the stimulation of RIG-I and MDA5 receptors (Figure 1C) , and thus may serve as a good control for TLR3 stimulation with poly(I:C). Control experiments with the LyoVec transfection reagent were performed to eliminate the contribution of cell membrane solubilization, which could affect the differences in protein expression observed in experiments with poly(I:C) and poly(I:C)/LyoVec (Figures 1E,F) . LyoVec transfection efficiency was confirmed by transfection of C8-D1A cells with LyoVec-GFP/SEAP complex ( Figure 1G ). Taken together, these results show that C8-D1A astrocytes, besides their responsiveness to the TLR3 ligand, alter the expression pattern of EEA1 and LAMP1, which presumably plays a part in the activation of TLR3-mediated intracellular signaling pathway.",

We chose such a time scale, mainly due to the rapidity of the formation of early endosomal vesicles during dsRNA uptake, to observe possible interactions between TLR3 and early endosomes. At the same time, we aimed to obtain evidence on early endosomal events in the astrocytes during the first 24 h after the addition of poly(I:C). In C8-D1A cells, TLR3 association with EEA1-labeled endosomes occurred as early as from the first minute after addition of the TLR3 ligand, suggesting that TLR3 may enter early endosomes already at this time (Figure 2) . The most frequent and robust co-localization was observed at 1 and 8 min following cell stimulation, however, at 8 min costaining was not seen in all cells. At 20, 30 min and 1 h following poly(I:C) treatment, TLR3 only partially co-stained FIGURE 1 | EEA1 decreases and LAMP1 expression increases depending on poly(I:C) stimulation time of C8-D1A murine astrocytes, while increasing TLR3 ligand concentration augments the expression of LAMP1.

EEA1, LAMP1, and Rab7 expression was also analyzed in cells treated with different concentrations of poly(I:C) (0; 0,1; 1; 2; 5; 10 \u00b5g/ml) (B), poly(I:C)/LyoVec (0; 0,1; 1; 2; 5 \u00b5g/ml) (D), or LyoVec (0; 0,1; 1; 2; 5 \u00b5g/ml) (F), and lysed 24 h following stimulation. GAPDH levels are shown to evaluate equal gel loading. The densitometry analysis of EEA1, LAMP1, and Rab7 was performed in cells treated with 10 \u00b5g/ml poly(I:C) for indicated time points (A); indicated poly(I:C) concentrations for 24 h (B); 1 \u00b5g/ml poly(I:C)/LyoVec for indicated time points (C); indicated poly(I:C)/LyoVec concentrations for 24 h (D); 1 \u00b5g/ml LyoVec for indicated time points (E); or indicated LyoVec concentrations for 24 h (F). Protein expression levels were normalized to GAPDH and presented as relative expression (mean \u00b1 SD). The GFP/SEAP reporter was efficiently delivered into C8-D1A cells when LyoVec was used as a transfectant (G). Statistical comparisons were performed between untreated and poly(I:C)-or poly(I:C)/LyoVec-or LyoVec-treated astrocytes (two sample Student's t-test; *P \u2264 0.05; **P \u2264 0.01). Cells transfected with LyoVec alone were used as a control to disengage the contribution of the membrane solubilization as well as interaction of the cationic detergent with cellular compartments. Data were obtained from three independent experiments. FIGURE 2 | TLR3 is present in EEA1-labeled endosomes at least up to 1 h following poly(I:C) stimulation of murine astrocytes. C8-D1A cells were not treated or treated with poly(I:C) for 1, 8, 12, 20, 30 min, 1, 2, 8, and 24 h. The astrocytes were then fixed and stained with specific antibodies for EEA1 (green) and TLR3 (red). Magn. -magnification of the selection marked with a white frame on the merged image (merge). White arrows indicate the TLR3 and EEA1 co-localization sites. Experiments were performed at least three times and only representative images are shown. Scale bar: 10 \u00b5m. Indirect PLA was performed to study the co-localization of EEA1 and TLR3 in not treated cells or in cells following 1 h of poly(I:C) stimulation. Positive PLA (red dots) was observed in cells stimulated with poly(I:C) for 1 h (see Supplementary Figure 2A ). with EEA1. After 1 h, co-localization of TLR3 and EEA1 was no longer detected. Graphs showing the EEA1 and TLR3 colocalization profiles are included in Supplementary Figure 1 . Control experiments with TLR3 labeled with FITC, and EEA1 labeled with rhodamine were performed in untreated cells and cells stimulated with poly(I:C) for 1 h. Analogous experiments were conducted using Duolink R in situ PLA ( Supplementary  Figure 2A) . In summary, co-localization of the astrocytic TLR3 and EEA1-labeled endosomes occurred during the first hour after the addition of poly(I:C). No co-staining was observed at 2 h and later, indicating that after this time TLR3 may have already been translocated from the early endosomes.",

The time range used here was selected basing on a collection of observations of others, where dsRNA, the TLR3 ligand, was present in Rab7-labeled endosomes in various types of cells at different times after stimulation (Qi et al., 2012; Westphal et al., 2017) . In our experiments, the presence of TLR3 in the late endosomes was confirmed at all-time points examined (Figure 3) . Noteworthy, until 20 min, TLR3 was present only in individual endosomes in several cells, while most of the late endosomes did not show the presence of TLR3. However, shortly thereafter, the formation and enlargement of endosomes was observed. Separate Rab7-labeled endosomes appeared in astrocytes at 30 min, while at 8 and 24 h we observed prominent, abundant co-localization of TLR3 and late endosomes (Figure 3) . Interestingly, from the first minute following poly(I:C) stimulation, a significant part of Rab7 was localized in what we think is the nucleoli, sites of the ribosome biogenesis. However, this requires experimental confirmation. Control experiments with TLR3 labeled with FITC, and Rab7 labeled with rhodamine were performed in untreated astrocytes and astrocytes treated with poly(I:C) for 24 h. Similar experiments were conducted using Duolink R in situ PLA (Supplementary Figure 2B) . Our data suggest that as the stimulation time increases, TLR3 is more abundant in late endosomes, with the highest presence at 8 and 24 h after the addition of poly(I:C).",

The affinity of TLR3 to its ligand increases with the environment acidity (Leonard et al., 2008) , however, the half-life of the FIGURE 3 | Astrocytic TLR3 is constantly present in late endosomes, however, TLR3 and Rab7 co-localization increases with the time of poly(I:C) stimulation. C8-D1A murine astrocytes were not stimulated or stimulated with poly(I:C) for 1, 8, 12, 20, 30 min, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h. Co-localization of Rab7 (green) and TLR3 (red) occurred in vesicular structures, which can be seen on merged images (merge). All merged pictures have been enlarged in the white frame area where the co-localization of Rab7 and TLR3 can be seen (magn.). White arrows indicate co-localization sites. Experiments were performed at least three times and only representative images are shown. Scale bar: 10 \u00b5m. Indirect PLA was performed to investigate the co-localization of Rab7 and TLR3 in untreated astrocytes or in astrocytes treated with poly(I:C) for 24 h. Positive PLA (red dots) was observed in cells stimulated with poly(I:C) for 24 h (see Supplementary Figure 2B ). receptor in the endolysosomal compartment remains variable. To examine the potential time of TLR3 residence in the lysosomal compartment, we examined the co-localization of TLR3 and LAMP1-labeled endosomes in C8-D1A cells not treated or treated with poly(I:C) (10 \u00b5g/ml) for 1, 8, 12, 20, 30 min, 2, 8, and 24 h. In resting astrocytes, TLR3 did not co-stain with lysosomes, however, the presence of the receptor was observed in LAMP1-marked endosomes in the first minute following treatment of cells with poly(I:C), and in all other times tested (Figure 4) . Thus, astrocytic TLR3 is not constitutively present in LAMP1(+) endosomes, but the localization of the receptor changes in response to its ligand. In the first minute after poly(I:C) stimulation, TLR3 appears to begin the translocation into LAMP1-labeled endosomes, because between 8 and 30 min co-localization of TLR3 and LAMP1 increased. Furthermore, the studied vesicles were initially spread throughout the cell, compared to those at 2 and 8 h post-stimulation, where TLR3 is present in single endosomes, however, only in some astrocytes. Finally, 24 h after poly(I:C) addition, we detected numerous lysosomes in all astrocytes and abundant co-localization with TLR3. Graphs showing the LAMP1 and TLR3 co-localization profiles are included in Supplementary Figure 3 . Control experiments with TLR3 labeled with FITC, and LAMP1 labeled with rhodamine were conducted in untreated cells and cells treated with poly(I:C) for 24 h. Corresponding experiments were performed using Duolink R in situ PLA (Supplementary Figure 2C) . Therefore, the presence of TLR3 in LAMP1-marked endosomes is ligand-dependent, and TLR3 can be found in the lysosomal compartment as early as the first minute following cell treatment. There is a possibility that these endosomes serve as TLR3 signaling compartment, however, they may also participate in TLR3 turnover and function as a safeguard to balance the signaling level.",

In our experiments on murine astrocytes, we confirmed the presence of TLR3 in all types of endosomes studied, although the frequency and intensity of TLR3 co-localization with EEA1, Rab7, and LAMP-1 varied depending on the duration of astrocyte stimulation with synthetic dsRNA. During the first ten minutes following poly(I:C) stimulation, astrocytic TLR3 was abundant in EEA1-labeled endosomes and appeared readily in LAMP1-labeled vesicles (Figures 2, 4 and Supplementary Figures 2A,C) , while the peak of TLR3 presence in late Rab7-labeled endosomes occurred between 8 and 24 h after poly(I:C) addition (Figure 3) . Finally, 24 h after the addition of poly(I:C), TLR3 co-localized with lysosomes in all astrocytes. TLR3 is an evolutionarily conserved molecule, constitutes a separate family among six major families of vertebrate TLRs (Roach et al., 2005) , and can occur in the same endosome types in both mammals and invertebrates (Zhang et al., 2013) . Our opinion is that discrepancies in populating various endosomes by TLR3 at different time intervals after stimulation of astrocytes reflect the stages of TLR3 transportation and the diverse functions of endosomes.",

An important element in the course of endosome maturation process is the loss of early endosomal marker EEA1, and the recruitment of Rab7, a marker of late endosomes (Rink et al., 2005) . Subsequently, progressive endosomal acidification occurs through fusion with lysosomal compartments and LAMP1 is one of the most abundant protein components in lysosome membranes (Terasawa et al., 2016) .

In our studies, TLR3 localized to early endosomes during the first hour after stimulation of astrocytes with the TLR3 ligand. Co-localization of TLR3 and EEA1 in astrocytes shows consistency with results in the other report on cells other than astrocytes. In human myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) EEA1-labeled early endosomes co-localized with fluorescently labeled dsRNA 15 and 30 min, however, not as early as 5 min following cell stimulation (Johnsen et al., 2006) . Accordingly, early endosomes may perform a transport function for dsRNA as well as deliver TLR3 to other populations of endosomes for proteolytic processing and/or activation. Other studies corroborate co-localization of early endosomes with TLR3 following stimulation of HeLa cells with IFN-\u03b2 (Tatematsu et al., 2015) , or following the receptor stimulation in human monocyte-derived immature DCs (MoDCs) (Watanabe et al., 2011) and 293T cells (Yang et al., 2016) . Nevertheless, in NCI-H292 cells not treated or treated with poly(I:C) for 30, 60, and 120 min, TLR3 did not co-localize with EEA1 (Toscano et al., 2013) , and in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) TLR3 co-localized with early endosomes 2 and 4 h following poly(I:C) stimulation (Tsai et al., 2015) . Therefore, the role of early endosomes in mediating the transportation of membrane proteins such as TLR3 and TLR3 ligands is worth studying.",

Tsai et al. (2015) also considered Rab7-labeled late endosomes as crucial for the TLR3 activation, since blockade of these endosomes resulted in the loss of IFN-\u03b2 expression and production. Interestingly, the inhibition of TLR3 proteolytic processing increased TLR3 co-localization with endosomes marked with Rab7 and LAMP1 (Qi et al., 2012) . These results indicate that late endosomes can play an important role in TLR3 activation, as they contain components from early endosomes and provide an environment adequate for the activity of cathepsins, enzymes crucial for TLR3 signaling (Garcia-Cattaneo et al., 2012) . However, late endosomes may also be involved in receptor degradation. The abundant co-localization of TLR3 with Rab7 at 8 and 24 h after receptor stimulation may indicate the involvement of endosomes in this process, as signal cascade and translocation of relevant transcription factors to the cell nucleus take place within 15 min after stimulating astrocytes with poly(I:C) (Mielcarska et al., 2019) and the degradation could occur at the same time or later following TLR3 stimulation. Negative regulation of TLR3 may account for the process parallel to signaling, similar to cleavage events following TLR9 activation (Hasan et al., 2016; Sinha et al., 2016) . In our opinion, TLR3 signaling accompanied by targeted loss of the receptor would aim at maintaining TLR3 homeostasis. The translocation of TLR3 to lysosomes occurred from the first minute after the addition of poly(I:C) to astrocytes. Such a result is consistent with that in human mDCs, where TLR3 trafficked into tubular lysosomes labeled with LAMP1 30 min after cell stimulation, but no co-localization was observed before this time (Johnsen et al., 2006) . Other studies also corroborate TLR3 presence in LAMP1-labeled endosomes 30 min following stimulation of 293T cells (Yang et al., 2016) . The prompt emergence of TLR3 in lysosomes following treatment of cells with poly(I:C) possibly occurs due to the receptor activation. We speculate that LAMP1-labeled endosomes constitute a TLR3 ligand recognition site, however, confirmatory studies are essential to incorporate this hypothesis. Interestingly, Toscano et al. (2013) observed that TLR3 abundantly co-localized with LAMP1, regardless of the epithelial cell stimulation, and the receptor levels remained uniform in LAMP1-marked endosomes. Our studies show that the highest abundance of TLR3 in LAMP1 endosomes was achieved after 24 h of stimulation (Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure 2C ) while no interaction of TLR3 and poly(I:C) was confirmed (Figure 5 ). At this time, similar to TLR9, we might observe a TLR3 fragment that remains in lysosomes and could perform an autoregulatory function . This is congruent with another study regarding TLR3 intracellular localization, which showed that TLR3 did not co-localize with the lysosome marker in resting DCs, however, 24 h after poly(I:C) stimulation, the receptor extensively shuttled to LAMP1(+) endosomes (Jelinek et al., 2011) . Such receptor localization 24 h after ligand addition may also indicate its degradation. Lysosomal degradation is vital in cell regulation and counterbalances the extension of the signaling (Huotari and Helenius, 2011) , however, more investigation is required to elucidate the fate of TLR3 as lysosomal cargo including inactivation of the receptor.",

            "text": "Studies on the interaction of poly(I:C) and TLR3 allowed us to conclude that an important research quandary remaining to be addressed when identifying the TLR3-containing compartment is the TLR3 ligand adsorption time and fate in cells. In C8-D1A astrocytes, fluorescein-labeled poly(I:C) localized intracellularly 16 h after addition to the cell medium (data not shown), however, conjugation of dsRNA with the fluorescent label may result in different absorption kinetics in the cells than unlabeled dsRNA. In BMDMs TLR3 co-stained with poly(I:C) at 8 h, but not 2, 10, or 24 h following poly(I:C) addition (Tsai et al., 2015) . Conversely, in C8-D1A cells, the interaction of TLR3 and dsRNA was observed right after the addition of the TLR3 ligand up to 8 h following poly(I:C) stimulation ( Figure 5) . Presumably, poly(I:C) endocytosis occurs in astrocytes within seconds or minutes, resulting in rapid ligand recognition by TLR3 and triggering an antiviral response. On the other hand, the lack of TLR3 and dsRNA interaction 24 h after ligand addition, with the abundant presence of the receptor in lysosomes, may be a sign of an intracellular process related to the negative regulation of the receptor level. We share the point of view that during viral infection, naked viral dsRNA reaches extracellular milieu following lysis of the infected cells (Matsumoto and Seya, 2008; Pohar et al., 2013; Mielcarska et al., 2018) , and TLR3 requires the internalization of RNA for sensing through an endocytic pathway (Tatematsu et al., 2018) . Several membrane proteins such as the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) and CD14 may be involved in the uptake of dsRNA in various cell types and play a role in TLR3-mediated immune signaling Bertheloot et al., 2016) . Considerable information available through insect research suggests that clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), an evolutionarily primeval system, serves as the mechanism responsible for dsRNA uptake, and transports it to early endosomes and subsequently late endosomes (Xiao et al., 2015; Cappelle et al., 2016; Pinheiro et al., 2018) . During CME in mammalian cells, plasma membrane scission leads to vesicle formation within \u223c10 s (Lacy et al., 2018) and more than half of the particles pass through the cell membrane in the first half of an hour (Parlea et al., 2016) . In Sf9 insect cells fluorescein-labeled dsRNA was detected on the plasma membrane 1 min following cell stimulation. Consecutively, uptake of labeled dsRNA was detected within 5 min after the addition of dsRNA to the medium, which eventually accumulated in acidic bodies 10 and 20 min after cell stimulation. Interestingly, dsRNA occurred mainly in early and late endosomes, but not in lysosomes (Yoon et al., 2017) , therefore, these vesicles were regarded as dsRNA intracellular carriers.",

Although only 2.6% of cells reveal TLR3 on the surface following 24 h stimulation with poly(I:C), we speculate that even minor quantities of the surface receptor in individual astrocytes could provide a substantial immune response. However, because we used the antibody raised against TLR3 ectodomain, there is a possibility that another TLR was also visualized, due to the notable sequence homology between the TLR extracellular domains (Marek and Kagan, 2011) . Moreover, studies with a virus that expresses a dsRNA intermediate have yet to be performed to compare poly(I:C) effect with the virus. HSV-1 infects primary murine glial cells, among which astrocytes are the most readily infected (Aravalli et al., 2006) . Interestingly, in cultures of glial cells, astrocytes may increase TLR3 expression following interaction with activated microglia; therefore, it is worth conducting an additional study in glial cell co-cultures. Although TLR3 is primarily found in the intracellular site, the receptor also occurs on the surface of mast cells (Agier et al., 2016) , macrophages (Murakami et al., 2014) , primary human astrocytes (Bsibsi et al., 2002) , and in the plasma membrane of epithelial cells where it serves as a defensive front line in the bronchial or gastrointestinal tract (Hewson et al., 2005; Bugge et al., 2017) . Moreover, rhinovirus (RV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) replication contributed to the increase of TLR3 cell membrane expression (Hewson et al., 2005; Groskreutz et al., 2006) . These findings indicate that dsRNA present in the external environment of the cell may interact with TLR3 localized at the plasma membrane and an increase in TLR3 membrane localization may serve to raise the cell sensitivity to viral exposure.",

Furthermore, the potential of astrocytes to maintain the physiological condition of neurons is particularly important, as these cells may have critical relevance on the prevention of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) formation and plaque production in the brain. Astrocytes have been shown to secrete Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which is involved in maintaining normal homeostasis and influences A\u03b2 clearance in the brain (Gee and Keller, 2005; Verghese et al., 2013) . However, astrocytes may also contribute to the A\u03b2 burden in the brain by secreting significant quantities of the amyloid, e.g., during conditions such as neuroinflammation (Frost and Li, 2017) . Because astrocytes comprise about 90% of the mass of the human brain, defects in their functioning may significantly contribute to brain pathology and particularly to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). HSV-1 is considered as a causative agent in the pathogenesis of sporadic AD (Harris and Harris, 2018) , and recent studies suggest that astrocytes secrete A\u03b2 as an anti-microbial protein (AMP) in response to HSV infection (Bourgade et al., 2015) . Extensive research data obtained from AD brains and HSV-infected cell cultures demonstrate that latent or chronic brain infections by HSV-1 may induce AD pathophysiology and pathology (Itzhaki, 2017 (Itzhaki, , 2018 Devanand, 2018) . Because TLR3 plays a pivotal role in the innate immune response to HSV-1 infection of the CNS, deciphering TLR3 biology and understanding how the receptor journeys over the endosomal pathway in astrocytes are critical to the design of interventional therapeutic options.",

TLR3 was rapidly transported to EEA1-labeled early endosomes and LAMP1-labeled lysosomes after synthetic dsRNA addition. As the stimulation increased, TLR3 largely co-localized with Rab7-labeled late endosomes, with the highest abundance at 8 and 24 h following poly(I:C) stimulation. Further, 24 h after the addition of the TLR3 ligand, the receptor was abundant in lysosomes in all astrocytes. TLR3 interacted with the synthetic ligand from 1 min to 8 h following stimulation of cells. Finally, we demonstrate a constitutive cell surface expression of TLR3 on astrocytes, which is enhanced by poly(I:C) stimulation. We are aware that astrocytes cultured in vitro partially acquire a reactive phenotype, therefore, comparable experiments performed on the cells isolated ex vivo would yield valuable results. TLR3 traverses the endosomal pathway to anchor in the ligand recognition sites and eventually undergoes degradation. On one hand, intracellular sequestration of TLR3 is requisite to the prevention of accidental recognition of self-nucleic acid, however, TLR3 present in the cell membrane may emerge as a promising target for immune response modulation. Identification of the temporal and spatial model of the TLR3 intracellular residence may also provide a basis for inhibiting or enhancing the TLR3 response.",
