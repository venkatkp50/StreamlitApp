            "text": "The world markets offer numerous products based on natural constituents with considerable differences in their classification. The category of food supplements (FSs [dietary supplements in the US]) holds the largest share of the whole botanical market in the US with over 80 %, while the OTC status plays a minor role with only about 3 % [1, 2] . By contrast, in Europe, the herbal market consists of a stable 28 % of the dietary supplement segment (2015-2019) [3] . The rest are registered drugs, even if there are some important differences among the different countries. However, under the restrictions in the reimbursement situation, this segment of FSs, as well as the self-medication OTC drugs, has recently started to grow, while the group of prescribed botanical products is decreasing [1, 4] . Actually, in several European countries, numerous botanical products are present on the market as MDs. MDs are part of mainstream medicine with a precise regulatory structure. This sector, regulated by Directive 93/42/EEC [5] , is expected to profoundly evolve after the introduction of the MDR officially published in Europe on May 5, 2017 [6] , due to the highquality research required in all aspects of the lifecycle of an MD. The MDR specifically names and strengthens MDs, which include substances mostly of natural origin, and introduces the official term \"medical devices made of substances\" (MDMS). It will enter into force on May 26, 2021, or possibly later due to COVID-19 [7] . The healthcare system, the scientific research community, and the industrial sector should perceive this change as an opportunity for innovation and therapeutic improvement.",

The new regulation also expressly envisages that such products may exert their action after oral administration and following systemic absorption. MDR identifies the possibility that \"they [the MDMS], or their products of metabolism, are systemically absorbed by the human body in order to achieve the intended purpose\". The key terms used in the EU definition of MDs are concerned with the \"intended action\" of the device and its \"mechanism of action\", which need to be \"nonpharmacological, immunological or metabolic\". MDR intends to \"establish a robust, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework for MDs, which ensures a high level of safety and health whilst supporting innovation\". Keeping this in mind, MDR gives new importance to existing issues, such as identifying an interpretation of the \"non-pharmacological, immunological, and metabolic mode of action\" that allows compliance of therapeutic botanical products to the regulatory settings delineated by Directive 2001/83/EC or MDR, as appropriate. Now that the European Commission, the Parliament, and the Council have decided to foster innovation through MDs made of substances, pharmacologists, physicians, and botanical experts need to concretely explain how botanicals can enact such innovation as MDMS. One of the most important issues is the correct interpretation of \"pharmacological, immunological, and metabolic mode of action\" for regulatory purposes. This issue is crucial because an inadequate interpretation would prevent the development of botanical therapeutic products and stifle the called-for innovation for European patients of all ages.",

This occurrence is particularly relevant because MDMS have the specificity of being composed of a very high number of molecules, acting in synchrony, in a way that is best represented by the concept of \"system\". A system is indeed different from the sum of its components and includes the inter-reactions and inter-relations among each molecule as well as the properties deriving from intermolecular interactions, which can only be observed when the system is integral. Accordingly, MDMS require a different approach in terms of defining their active ingredients and consequent mechanism of action, since the mechanism of action is represented by that of the entire product rather than that of 1 selected single component. For MDMS and MDs made of natural substances, in particular, a reproducible quality is the basis for a constant efficacy and safety and includes the standardization of extraction methods, the chemical composition assessment, safety assessment, and proper clinical evidence of efficacy [15] . However, the theoretical and practical approach to establish the mechanisms of interaction with cellular components for these MDs is profoundly different from that of a product claiming 1 single active ingredient, and it seems important that this change in the approach should lead to a change in regulatory attitude.",

It has been recently discussed at several levels that there should be a new concerted effort to overcome methodological obstacles that hinder advances in natural products research, and the application of \"systems biology methods\" and the advancement of \"omics-based\" technologies is highly recommended [19] . This attitude pushes forward the knowledge of the history of natural products as sources of medicine and drives toward the discovery of multiple target signature clusters of biological pathways modulated by the complex effects of natural products.

In this way, the Medical Device Regulation, with respect to Directive 93/42, increases the levels of evidence required for the MD, as well as the management of the evidence produced. In this respect, it aligns with the world of medicinal products and promotes the development of innovative complex substances based on evidence during the entire life cycle of the product. One of the fields of innovation of MDR is clinical evidence. In particular, organized and active PMS activities are required within the quality system of the manufacturer and are collected in a structured way in the PMS plan. Here the manufacturer identifies all the initiatives he will carry out to constantly deepen the knowledge on its MDs in real-life settings. The aim of PMS actions is to identify any need to apply any corrective or preventive action on the MD for the ongoing increasing safety of such products. MDR also confirms the central role of vigilance in the post-marketing activities of a manufacturer. Vigilance includes all those activities to collect and manage any report on adverse events and reactions regarding the MD. The single patient can report an adverse event either directly to the manufacturer or through the healthcare professional. MDR requires the manufacturer to have a vigilance reference person and a vigilance system in place.",

The intent is that transparency will be improved, and the information regarding the MDs available on the EU market will be coordinated. This information is structured around 6 interconnected areas, called modules, which are: 1) actors registration, 2) UDI/devices registration, 3) notified bodies and certificates, 4) clinical investigations and performance studies, 5) vigilance and post-market surveillance, and 6) market surveillance. The various modules will be made available when ready, starting from December 2020, on the Eudamed public website at \"ec.europa.eu/tools/eudamed\" [26] . Accordingly, Eudamed will have many purposes. It will work as a registration system, as a system for communication and cooperation among professionals, as a notification system, and as a dissemination system for the information that will be available to the public.",

Natural complex products seems to fill a gap found in clinics, therefore having an additional regulatory framework for the development of such products is necessary. Hence, it seems that Regulation 2017/745/CE allows an adequate platform for the sound development, as MDMS, of products made of natural substances, especially for the interest of the patient. By analogy with medicinal products, the clinical data required to claim any \"intended purpose\" have been strengthened with respect to the previous legislation, and the safety of the device needs to be continuously confirmed by post-market clinical follow-up activities.",

Our analysis is that although single molecules can be best described by the key-lock model, which underlies the \"pharmacological, immunological and metabolic action\" of medicinal products, complex substances do not fit this model. We bring forward that where the key-lock model does not apply, such as in natural complex substances, the mechanism of action cannot be regarded as pharmacological, immunological, or metabolic. Natural substances allow both approaches: that which isolates the active principles and that which keeps the complexity of the starting material. Each approach allows the development of products that have a role in therapeutics; therefore, it seems of great importance to have both approaches concretely available. It appears that now is the time for both researchers and regulators to develop new, evidencebased innovative products for the many unmet medical needs and European priorities, among which is also the need for products with high environmental sustainability.
