First, like most other African countries, Cameroon suffers from the double burden of infectious diseases (e.g. tuberculosis, Human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) and malaria) and non-communicable diseases (e.g., sickle cell diseases, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and renal diseases amongst others) [7] . In addition, confinement was not the hallmark of mitigation efforts in Cameroon [5] . For these reasons, we expected all these factors to contribute to an escalation of the transmission of COVID-19 in Cameroon. Unfortunately, less than 3.9% of scientific reports on COVID-19 have originated from Africa [8] and very few from Cameroon [9] . To fill this gap, the study sought to describe clinical features of COVID-19 infection and risk factors for patients admitted in the Djoungolo Hospital COVID-19 treatment centre in Cameroon.",

A total of 26 patients with more than 80% missing variables were automatically excluded from the analysis. Epidemic curves were constructed with admission dates at the treatment centre. Age sex pyramids were computed for all confirmed cased and for severe COVID-19 cases. Comorbidities and symptoms were summarised as counts and percentages. Length of hospital stay and timeto-hospitalisation were expressed as ranges and medians. We compared eligible patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 with non-cases. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the associations between the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection and the following variables: age, gender, profession, smoking, symptoms and exposure (travel history and participation in a mass gathering). We compared confirmed severe cases with confirmed non-severe cases. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the association between age, gender, underlying comorbidity, symptoms, and the dependent variable of severity of disease. The glmulti package was used in R for automated model selection and multimodel inference [15] . The fit and plausibility of various models [15] were examined in RStudio, focusing on models which contained none, one, and up to seven (i.e., all) of moderator variables for risk of severity. We used two groups of moderator variables: group 1 for the prediction of COVID-19 diagnosis and group 2 for the prediction of severity of COVID-19. Group 1 included age group, gender, symptoms and exposure. Group 2 included age groups, gender and comorbidities (i.e., HIV infection, diabetes, lung disease and hypertension). We considered models with main effects only. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) [16] was used to choose the most performant model. In other words, the best model was considered to have the lowest AIC with Akaike weights and Kullback-Leibler divergence indicating the highest probability of model accuracy. A p-value <0.05 for any test or model was considered statistically significant. Data analysis was performed with STATA version 13 and RStudio Version 1.3.1073 for modelling.",

            "text": "Analysis of COVID-19 severity and mortality varies across the world. Grant et al. (2020) reported findings synthesised from studies conducted across 10 Western countries: United Kingdom UK, the United States of America, Singapore, Italy, Australia, Japan, Korea, and the Netherlands [17] . These authors indicated that 19% of patients hospitalised in these countries required non-invasive ventilation, which is quite close to the value found in our setting [17] . The CFR was relatively low at the Djoungolo Hospital (1%) and this can be partially explained by standard operating procedures for management at Djoungolo Hospital which required transfer of critical cases to more sophisticated treatment centres. However, due to overcrowding in sophisticated centres, some critical patients were managed at the Djoungolo Hospital and this accounts for the fatalities reported. Nonetheless, the CFR obtained in this study was similar to the Cameroonian National CFR estimated at 2% as of the 07 th October 2020 [4] . Our CFR was also similar to the average CFR reported in South Korea and Germany, while countries like France and Belgium had relatively high CFR (20 and 16% respectively) [5]. Grant et al. (2020) found a CFR of 7% in their meta-analysis [17] . This variability could be due to the difference of age of confirmed cases. As seen in our study, more than 55% of patients in our study were aged less than 50 and the mean age was 44 years as compared to 49 years as reported by Grant et al. [17] . Clinical features of COVID-19 infection in our setting were slightly different from those reported by studies in high-income countries. The Grant et al. (2020) 13 ,385 patients; I2 95%) as the most common symptoms. Fatigue (31%, CI = 27-35%, 31 studies; I2 = 95%), dyspnoea (23%, CI = 19-28%; 94 studies; I2 = 97%) and headaches (13%, CI = 10-16, 65 studies) had smaller proportions than those reported in our study [17] . In the same line with Grant et al. (2020) , gastrointestinal manifestations, sore throat, and nasal discharge were also less common in the current study. In our study, ophthalmic manifestations were not prevalent. Differences in population characteristics (i.e., age, race, genetic make-up or immunity) and even settings (climate and environment) might explain the differences noticed in the findings. Dysgeusia (46%) and hyposmia/anosmia (39%) had higher prevalence in our study when compared with findings reported by Grant et al. (2020) (i.e., hypogusia 25%, hyposmia 4%) [17] . In a systematic review recently published by Mehraeen et al. (2020) , 95% of studies had anosmia as a feature of COVID-19 infection [18] . It is worth mentioning that Mehraeen et al. (2020) and Grant et al. (2020) had similar methods as they both included evidence from at least 10 Western countries and conducted their searches from December 2019/January 2020 to April 2020. However, Grant et al. (2020) had no language restrictions and reviewed a wider range of papers. This difference in scope might explain the difference in findings. In general, there is growing evidence that COVID-19 also presents with olfactory as well as gustatory dysfunction, but the pathogenesis is not yet known [18] . This finding could imply that the current case definition of COVID-19 published by the WHO may need to be updated [13] . In our study, 29% of patients suffered from a comorbidity, while Morgan et al. (2020) had twice more patients who had at least 01 comorbidity (40%) in a meta-analysis of COVID-19 and comorbidities [19] . Morgan et al. (2020) synthesized evidence from Western countries including China, South Korea, Australia, and the USA, which have relatively older populations [19] . This difference in ages might explain the higher prevalence of cases with comorbidities in their settings. They also found the commonest comorbidity to be hypertension and the majority of fatal cases had at least 01 comorbidity (74%), in agreement with our findings. They equally observed that diabetes and respiratory illnesses were prevalent in the deceased [19] , which is not the case in the current study where hypertension was identified as common in the deceased.",

The median range of length of hospital stay ranged from 4 to 53 days in China and 4 to 21 days elsewhere (i.e., Europe, USA and UK) [20] . Most studies included by Rees et al. (2020) were conducted in China (88%) and specifically in Wuhan [20] . Lengthy hospital stays reported by Rees et al. (2020) can be explained by inclusion of studies analysing critically ill and old patients (average 68-69 years) [20] . In our context, long hospital stays were equally observed in patients aged more than 70 years. The speed at which the last negative test for SARS-CoV2 was obtained also explains lengthy stays in our study. With the reduced testing capacity at the beginning of the epidemic in Cameroon, it was a real challenge to obtain PCR results after 14 days. Additionally, length of hospitalization can vary by the culture of clinical practice, as well as by disease severity and logistical constraints, thus complicating comparisons among international settings.",

(2020) synthesised available evidence on models for COVID-19, The most frequent predictors of COVID-19 diagnosis in suspected cases were vital signs, flu-like signs and symptoms, age, sex, radiological features, laboratory results (electrolytes, white blood cell count, liver enzymes etc), cough or sputum and contacts with confirmed cases of COVID-19 [21] . In the context of this study, we obtained a few similar predictors including flu-like symptoms (myalgia/arthralgia) and exposure. However, most flu-like symptoms such as runny nose, fatigue and chills were not predictive of a diagnosis of COVID-19 in our study. Unfortunately, laboratory and radiological tests could not be systematically performed for patients in our setting.",

In addition, HIV infection appeared as a significant predictor of severity in this study though not reported in Western settings. In Cameroon, HIV prevalence was estimated at 2.9% in 2019, with 75% of HIV infected people knowing their status and only 62% on treatment [25] . Perhaps this burden might explain our findings. The most significant variable for prediction of COVID-19 severity in the current study was age group 60 to 69 and unexpectedly, people aged more than 70 years were not at increased risk of COVID-19 severity in our study. The small representation of patients aged more than 70 years in our sample might explain this finding. In a meta-analysis conducted by Rahman et al. (2020) , male gender, hypertension, diabetes, fatigue or myalgia, and smoking history were found to be risk factors for COVID-19 severity [22] . There are some differences in comparison with our results, which do not include smoking, hypertension as risk factors for severity. Studies included in the meta-analysis were conducted in China, perhaps these differences in population characteristics such as smoking history might account for differences in risk factors for severity. For instance, Rahman et al. (2020) had a proportion of 11% of cigarette smokers compared with 1% in our study population [22] . On the other hand, diabetes and male gender have been consistently reported to potentially increase the risk of suffering from severe form of COVID-19 in other settings [23, 24] .",

Apart from social gatherings, mass gatherings and high density activities in general are associated with generation of income and revenues through formal or informal employment and other businesses [26] . Cameroon faced a dire dilemma between restricting all mass gatherings to curb COVID-19 while suffering from an economic crisis and choosing to let businesses be open and taking the risk of increasing the spread of COVID-19, which is particularly challenging given its developing status. Due to the effects on the economy, on 30 th April 2020, the government relaxed social distancing measures [11] . Restrictions were lifted on opening hours for businesses and even transportation. This change might explain, at least in part the rise in admissions at the Djoungolo Hospital from May 2020 to June 2020.",

Only 54 suspected cases had no evidence of infection with SARS-CoV2, which might have impacted the multivariable analysis of risk of COVID-19 infection. The study was conducted at a single centre; thus generalisability of findings nationwide might not be accurate. Additionally, conducting rigorous research in a context of a novel pandemic was challenging and missing data was common. For instance, incubation periods were not calculated as only 07% had required data. Moreover, in our setting, laboratory and radiological diagnostics could not be systematically performed for patients. Some critical cases were referred to more sophisticated centres as required and this might in part explain the low CFR obtained at the Djoungolo Hospital.",

There was a broad range of prevalent symptoms in patients, including olfactory symptoms. The majority of patients admitted had no comorbidity and the commonest comorbidity was hypertension, although it did not predict severity. Mass gathering, loss of taste, abdominal pains and myalgia/arthralgia were predictors of COVID-19 diagnosis. Male gender, history of diabetes, history of lung disease, history of HIV infection, the presence of dyspnoea and fatigue were predictors of disease severity. Future studies should aim at presenting clinical and epidemiological features of COVID-19 with larger data sets. ",
