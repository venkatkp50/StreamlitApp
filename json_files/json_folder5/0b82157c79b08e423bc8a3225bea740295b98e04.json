How should we understand Sars-CoV-2 and why does it matter? The argument we present is that the virus undermines any neat distinction between the natural and the human-made, the biological and the social. Rather, to understand the virus and the pandemic we need to understand both as intimately connected to our own social and historical condition. What started as a reflection on the nature of the virus thus turns into a reflection on the human condition as refracted in this pandemic or an anthropology of the virus.",

It also generates reactions such as considering viruses as \"enemies\" or something to be defeated through \"war,\" setting the stage for forms of preparedness simply based on culling, vaccine stockpiling, social distancing, lockdown and disinfection. These solutions are important in certain moments, but they focus only on a portion of the problem (virus-as-disease) while ignoring all the other aspects of the pandemic. Commenting on the measures taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, including especially the closure of its beaches, historian Warwick Anderson has observed, \"The understanding of viral transmission has been reduced to a mechanical model of contact and contamination, with some alien and stigmatized groups recognized as having special proclivity for carrying and communicating the pathogen-stranger super-spreaders-on safeguarded and sacralized sites, such as the beach. The environmental, social, and cultural complexity of disease transmission, the varied and contingent configurations of spread, are erased, replaced by fear of proximity to others. Disease prevention dwindles into a purification ritual\" (Anderson 2020) .",

Like Gorbalenya, he rejects the notion that viruses \"attack\" us. Yet departing from Gorbalenya, he believes military metaphors stem from considering viruses as living entities with their own agency (Napier 2020) . Rejecting this notion and specifically commenting on the COVID-19 pandemic, Napier notes, \"Science \u2026 has led us to believe that viruses invade us, which they don't. \u2026 Proliferation is a social matter\u2026. Our inability to involve social science seriously in responding to COVID-19 and how it makes specific populations vulnerable\u2026has altered the epidemic landscape profoundly\" (Napier 2020) . Historian Andy Horowitz concurs when he writes, \"The history that scholars will name 'the COVID-19 pandemic' ultimately will have as much to do with the social world the virus encounters as it does with the virus itself\" (Horowitz 2020) . That these considerations always again turn around the apparently intractable question whether viruses should be considered as living or non-living entities speaks to the key role the distinction between life and non-life plays in late neoliberal narratives and configurations, a distinction grounding new forms of human and non-human marginalization and exploitation (Povinelli 2016) .",

Karen Barad proposes the term \"intra-action\" instead of \"interaction\" exactly to highlight the fact that agencies (in this case the virus and humans) are not distinguished before their encounter but arise from it (Barad 2007) . SARS-CoV-2 is neither natural/biological nor human-made/cultural: humans are the main vectors for its proliferation and this makes the virus always and already both natural and human made. Some scientists are trying to analyze such complexity by aggregating a huge number of heterogeneous data sets about the pandemic (Capua and Rasetti 2020) .
