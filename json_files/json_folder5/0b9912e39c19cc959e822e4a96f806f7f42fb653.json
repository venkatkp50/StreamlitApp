With only few studies addressing health disparities in patients with PAH, the American Thoracic Society encouraged further research to achieve more equitable care, improve advocacy efforts and public health policy for patients with PAH (8) . Health disparities, in particular mental disorders may contribute to differences in clinical parameters, treatment and survival in patients with PAH.

Higher scores indicating a more severe anxiety or depression.

Disease severity indicated by WHO FC, 6MWD, NT-proBNP, DLCO, hemodynamics at time of diagnosis as well as PAH treatment did not differ between patients with or without mental disorders ( Table 1 ). In addition, there were no differences in drinking habits or exercise scores but patients with any form of mental disorder were nearly two-times more likely to be active smokers (23 vs. 12%). Patients with MDD or PD had significantly worse HADS-A and HADS-D scores. Psychological and physical QoL was worse in patients with MDD or PD (all p < 0.001).",

The presence of MDD or PD was the only factor significantly influencing the rate of communication events. Patients with MDD or PD had worse QoL and HADS-scores while no differences in PAH medication or lifestyle factors were found. Education had no impact on number of outpatient visits or communication events nor were there any differences in education between patients with or without MDD or PD. Impact on outpatient visits was determined by age and 6MWD while communication events were impacted by the presence of MDD or PD. While the association of age and 6MWD on outpatient visits was significant, absolute differences in number of outpatient visits were small suggesting only limited impact on clinical practice. Overall, the difference of 0.2 or 0.1 visits per year respectively might not result in an impaired health-careutilization for patients with MDD or PD. The only determinant for an increased number of communication events was the presence of MDD or PD. These patients had an almost two-fold increase in communication events while there were no differences in therapy strategies or disease severity ( Table 1) . This is in line with previous studies showing that the presence of a mental health disorder is associated with significantly higher health care resource utilization and costs independent of disease severity (24, 25) .",

            "text": "Our findings raise questions about optimizing the management of patients with PAH especially in the setting of mental disorders. First, mental disorders such as major depressive disorders or panic disorders need to be assessed in routine care. However, a SCID maybe not be feasible for screening purposes. The HADS was recently proven to detect anxiety and depression in patients with PAH (13) but also other tools such as the Hamilton Anxiety-or Depression Scale (HAM-A or HAM-D) might be feasible. Further, studies have shown that poor access to coordinated mental health care had impact on acute health-care-utilization. Different models of care such as a multidisciplinary approach with the integration of medical and psychiatric health care have been described in primary as well as specialty care such as is PAH care (29) . Recent studies have shown a higher prevalence of adjustment disorders among mental disorders in patients with PAH (13) . Metacognitive treatment, a cognitive behavioral therapy, has been successfully applied to a patient with newly diagnosed PAH suffering from severe adjustment disorder (30, 31) . With only limited data on psychiatric treatment options in patients with PAH, further studies are needed. This preliminary report on health disparities and health care utilization raises the question of improved patient care for patients with PAH. Knowledge, deeper understanding, and education of psychiatric disorders is key to prevent further stigma, increase awareness for patients challenges and needs and improve QoL beyond the physical burden of PAH. We suggest a specialized approach to address the needs of patients with MDD or PD through available treatment programs. PAH patients with MDD or PD have an increased need for assistance of social workers, physiotherapist and occupational therapist which should be a valuable asset in PAH patient's care. Further the availability of fast-track psychiatric consultations and acute crisis management should be of importance. In summery we suggest a comprehensive multidisciplinary psychiatric medical care for patients with MDD or PD and conclude that further research is needed to inform clinicians on the differences in health care utilization in the presence of psychiatric disorders.",

Linear regression analysis showed a significant impact of age and 6MWD on the number of visits per year. Per 10 years of patients age there was a loss of 0.2 visits per year (p = 0.003) and per 50 m 6MWD there was a loss of 0.1 visits per year (p = 0.007). Impact on communication events per year was only determined by the presence of MDD or PD. If a patient had any current MDD or PD, correspondence increased by 2.2 communication events per year (p = 0.001) with the linear regression analysis stating a constant of 2.4 communication events per year. This results in a near two-fold number of communication events in the presence of MDD or PD.
