This explosion of information has stimulated interest in automated tools to help identify useful knowledge. We have pursued the use of methods for extracting diverse forms of mechanism relations from the natural language of scientific papers. We seek to identify concepts in COVID-19 and related literature which represent activities, functions, associations and causal relations, ranging from cellular processes to economic impacts. We formulate a broad, coarse-grained schema targeting mechanism relations between open, free-form entities. Our approach strikes a balance between expressivity and breadth that supports generalization across diverse concepts. We curate a dataset 1 of scientific papers annotated according to our novel schema. Using an information extraction model trained on this new corpus, we construct a knowledge base (KB) of 2M mechanism relations, which we make publicly available. Our model is able to extract relations at an F1 at least twice that of baselines such as open IE or related scientific IE systems. We conduct experiments examining the ability of our system to retrieve relevant information on viral mechanisms of action, and on applications of AI to COVID-19 research. In both cases, our system identifies relevant information from our automaticallyconstructed knowledge base with high precision. * Equal contribution, listed in alphabetical order.",

In this paper, our overarching goal is to build a knowledge base (KB) that scientists can use to search and explore diverse interdisciplinary mechanisms in literature related to COVID-19. Figure 1 shows examples of the types of mechanisms we focus on. These include mentions of mechanistic activities (e.g., viral binding), of functions that natural or artificial entities serve (e.g., a protein used for binding, or image analysis used in public health), and also more indirect influences and associations (such as possible complications associated with a medical procedure). These relationships cover a wide range of domain-specific concepts in scientific papers, providing a unified language which can be used for domainagnostic extraction and scientific search (with results as seen in Figure 1 ). More broadly, a KB of mechanisms across science could enable the transfer of ideas across disparate areas (Hope et al. 2017; Kittur et al. 2019) , and assist in literature-based discovery (Swanson and Smalheiser 1996; Spangler et al. 2014; Nordon et al. 2019) by finding crossdocument causal links (Swanson and Smalheiser 1996) .",

Some of these relations correspond to mechanisms (e.g., chemical-protein regulation, or drug-drug interactions), but capture only a fraction of the full breadth and depth of mechanisms in the literature. It is challenging to formulate comprehensive fine-grained schemas for diverse domains; on the other extreme, Open IE approaches (Etzioni et al. 2008; Stanovsky et al. 2018 ; Zhan and Zhao 2020) focus on general-purpose, schemafree extraction of relations, but many of the relations are generic and uninformative for scientific applications",

            "text": "Exact definitions of mechanisms are subject to debate in the philosophy of science (R\u00f6hl 2012; Keeling et al. 2019) . A dictionary definition of mechanisms refers to a natural or established process by which something takes place or is brought about. More intricate definitions discuss \"complex systems producing a behavior\", \"entities and activities productive of regular changes\", \"a structure performing a function in virtue of its parts and operations\", or the distinction between \"correlative property changes\" and \"activity determining how a correlative change is achieved\" (R\u00f6hl 2012) . The schema we propose in this work (see Section 3, Figures 1,2) draws inspiration from these existing definitions. We extract activities and functions, and also more general influences and associations. Our work is also related to a large body of literature on extracting information from biomedical papers. This information often corresponds to very specific types of mechanisms such as chemical-protein regulation and drug-drug interactions (Li et al. 2016; Segura Bedmar, Mart\u00ednez, and Herrero Zazo 2013) . In the CHEMPROT dataset (Li et al. 2016) for example, texts are annotated for relations capturing interactions between chemicals and proteins (e.g., up/down regulation). The annotation guidelines for CHEMPROT distinguish between direct and indirect interactions, between relations explicitly and implicitly referred to in the text, and between texts where \"mechanistic information is available\" and those where the nature of an interaction is more vague. A semantic predication schema akin to Semantic Role Labeling, with predicates such as X treats Y or X induces Y, has also been proposed (Kilicoglu et al. 2011) . Concepts and relations in that work were also limited to a relatively narrow set of biomedical sub-domains and entities aligned with the UMLS biomedical onotolgy (Bodenreider 2004 ) such as names of drugs and diseases (see Section 5.1 for more details). Recent work has applied such tools to extract information from the CORD-19 corpus, for constructing KBs (Wise et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2020a) and visualizations (Hope et al. 2020) . Unfortunately, biomedical ontologies suffer from cultural differences between disciplines that lead to a lack of a unified language (Wang et al. 2018) and many fragmented classes (Salvadores et al. 2013 ) -with only a small a fraction at the focus of mainstream biomedical IE. In the next section, we present our schema for unified extraction of mechanisms -in biomedicine, and beyond.",

Annotators are asked to evaluate relations in similar fashion to our annotation guidelines, tagging relations as positive if they reflect a mechanism described in the text, and if they consist of coherent argument spans that capture essential information for the relation to hold, but not redundant or irrelevant information. Table 4 shows a major increase in relation accuracy, as compared to results obtained with automated metrics. In particular we reach average positive rating of over 91%, a high figure in absolute terms, and more than double the rating of SRL (41.7%). Inter-rater agreement was high at 71 by Cohen's Kappa score and 73 by Matthew Correlation Coefficient (MCC) score. Interestingly, we observe that while in absolute numbers the gap between our human-evaluated accuracy and the partial metrics is high, there is strong correlation between them in the overall trend. In particular, accuracy as measured using the rouge-L score to match relations increases more than two-fold for our model in comparison to SRL (from 22.4 to 55.2).
