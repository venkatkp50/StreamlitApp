Adaptive immune 19 receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq) is a common approach to study immune system 20 dynamics. Understanding the genetic factors influencing the composition and dynamics 21 of these repertoires is of major scientific and clinical importance. The chromosomal loci 22 2 Introduction 39 The immune system's success in fighting countless evolving pathogens depends on a dy-40 namic and diverse set of B and T cell receptors. Due to the longevity of immunological 41 memory, high throughput sequencing of adaptive immune receptor repertoires (AIRR-seq) 42 provides detailed insights into the past and present encounters of the human immune sys-43 tem [21]. It can teach us about fundamental immune processes and reveal dysregulation, 44 with broad implications for biomedicine. B and T cell receptors are assembled during differ-45 entiation of hematopoietic stem cells, by a complex process involving somatic recombination 46 of a large number of germline-encoded V, D, and J gene segments, along with junctional di-47 versity that is added at the boundaries where these segments are joined together [40]. This 48 V(D)J recombination process creates a diverse repertoire of receptors that together with the 49 innate immune system form the first line of defense against pathogens. 50 Genetic factors are expected to influence the structure and functionality of AIRRs [23, 51 52]. However, understanding these genetic effects is confounded by lack of knowledge 52 about the population genetics of the TCR and BCR encoding genomic loci, and the special 53 challenges involved in describing the germline gene set of any individual [9]. The lack of 54 knowledge about these loci is due to difficulties in reliably mapping repetitive elements and 55 undocumented structural variations with short read sequencing. Many TCR genes were 56 reported in the decade after their first discovery [25]. Complete sequences of the TCR 57 encoding loci were reported in 1985 [24, 70, 61], and this led to the development of the TCR 58 encoding genes nomenclature by the ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT) group [30]. Since then, very 59 few allelic variants have been entered into the IMGT reference directories of germline genes. 60 In fact no new allelic variants of the TCR variable region genes have been named this century 61 despite published studies suggesting that the IMGT TCR reference directory may be far from 62 complete [33, 35, 60]. 63",

Hence, to study genomic variations in TCR encoding loci and 76 their relations to the expressed repertoires, there is a need to adapt BCR inference tools to 77 TCR data. 78 In T cells, due to lack of somatic mutations, most studies sequence only a small fraction 79 of the variable region. AIRR-seq data can be generated by methods that differ in the length 80 of their coverage of V(D)J sequences. 5' RACE amplifies the whole V(D)J region from the 81 3' end of the J region to the 5' end of the mRNA molecule. BIOMED-2 primers [62] amplify 82 partial VDJ sequences from the J gene to the framework-2 (FR2) of the V gene, while the 83 Adaptive Biotechnologies [48] approach generates only 87 nucleotides from a fixed posi-84 tion within each TRBJ gene in FR4, and includes the complementary determining region 85 3 (CDR3) and a fraction of the TRBV gene from FR3.

Thus, 88 the development of a TRBV genotype inference method requires the thorough documenta-89 tion of any gene pairs that can be impossible to distinguish for a given sequencing approach. 90 Here, we adapt a B cell inference pipeline to TRB AIRR-seq data (Fig. 1a) , to work 91 with these three types of sequencing approaches (Fig. 1b) , and infer undocumented alleles, 92 single and double chromosome deletions, genotypes, and haplotypes. The pipeline was 93 adapted to deal with the gene assignment ambiguity problem, which is especially important 94 in the analysis of data-sets of partial sequences (Fig. 1c-d) . This is an even greater problem 95 in data-sets of partial sequences (Fig. 1c-d) . We applied this pipeline to four of the largest 96 AIRR-seq data-sets currently available and revealed a rich picture of germline variability, and 97 a demonstration of how a single nucleotide polymorphism dramatically affects the composi-98 tion of the whole repertoire. These results may have important implications to TCR based 99 immunotherapy and disease diagnosis. 100 3 3 Results 101 102 To explore allelic variation in the TRBV locus, we inferred the sets of alleles carried for 103 each expressed TRBV gene in many individuals (personal genotypes). For this, we took a 104 multi step approach, in which we first assigned each sequence to the most likely allele(s) 105 using IgBLAST [69] with a reference panel of all the documented TRBV alleles as they 106 appear in IMGT [30]. Then, we used IgDiscover [10] to detect candidate sequences that 107 have not previously been documented in IMGT. Hereafter, we will refer to such sequences 108 as \"undocumented alleles\". Following this step, we re-ran IgBLAST [69] with an extended 109 reference germline sequence set that includes the candidates for undocumented alleles. 110 Finally, we inferred the personal genotype of each gene and individual using TIgGER [20]. To 111 ensure our confidence in the inference of undocumented alleles, we took steps that reduce 112 the influence of sequencing errors.

However, this approach relies on complete coverage of the receptors' variable 28 regions, and most T cell studies sequence only a small fraction of the variable region. Here, 29 we adapted BCR inference methods to full and partial TCR sequences, and identified 38 30 undocumented polymorphisms in TRBV, 15 of them were also observed in genomic data 31 assemblies. Further, we identified 31 undocumented 5' UTR sequences. A subset of these 32 inferences was also observed using independent genomic approaches. We found the two 33 documented TRBD2 alleles to be equally abundant in the population, and show that the 34 single nucleotide that differentiates them is strongly associated with dramatic changes in the 35 expressed repertoire. Our findings expand the knowledge of genomic variation in the TRB 36 (T Cell Receptor Beta) locus and provide a basis for annotation of TCR repertoires for future 37 basic and clinical studies. SNP within a stretch of four or more identical nucleotides were considered, as such a stretch 118 is more likely to arise from a sequencing read artefact. 119 We applied the above approach to four data-sets, spanning different sequencing proto-120 cols and scales (see methods). From DS1, which includes 28 individuals sequenced in full 121 length, we inferred 18 undocumented alleles (Fig. 2a) . Four of the 18 alleles were only seen 122 at very low levels -less than 20% of all identified alleles of those genes, and showed a 123 uni-modal distribution. This did not follow our expected usage distribution (these alleles are 124 marked red in Fig. 2a ). These candidate \"alleles\" therefore potentially result from sequenc- 125 ing errors. Two more undocumented alleles were considered erroneous due to adjacent 126 nucleotide stretches. After discarding these six allele candidates, we were left with 12 un-127 documented alleles. Nine of the alleles were observed in more than a single individual's 128 genotype, which increases our confidence in the inferences. 129 For further validation, we compared the undocumented alleles to three sources (Supp.",

The second was a pmDb [27] 132 data-set, where we found four out of the 12 undocumented alleles. The third was long-read 133 assemblies of 35 diploid from Ebert et al. [13] which confirmed six out of the 12 undoc-134 umented alleles. All together, two of the 12 undocumented alleles were observed in all 135 sources. 136 In addition to the 18 undocumented alleles, five additional undocumented allelic variants 137 were identified in DS1 that matched known allele references in IMGT, except in their 3' end 138 that is missing in IMGT (Supp. [55]. The 3' ends of the L-PART1 references of the three sequences in IMGT seem to orig-162 inate from the intron, and the 5' splice site of the introns of those three alleles were likely 163 misidentified in IMGT (Supp. Fig. 8 ). We also found three variant consensus sequences 164 associated with TRBV6-2*01/TRBV6-3*01 (Supp. Fig. 7 ), all three were observed in the 165 long-read assemblies for the TRBV6-2*01 annotation. One of them, TRBV6-2*01/TRBV6-166 3*01 2 was also observed in the undocumented allele TRBV6-3*01 G47A. 167 Next, we analyzed DS2, which includes data from 25 individuals. Fifteen undocumented 168 alleles were inferred (Fig. 2a) . Nine of them were also observed in DS1. Five others 169 were present in the short-read whole genome databases, one in Luo et al. [33] and four 170 in pmDB [27] . Two out of those five undocumented alleles were observed in the long-read 171 assemblies of 35 diploid from Ebert et al. [13] . One out of those two undocumented alleles 172 was observed in all sources (Supp. The left panel shows undocumented alleles within the genotype. Each row represents an undocumented allele, each column represents an individual. The Y-axis annotations in red, green, and blue correspond to alleles not following the expected multi-modal distribution, alleles adjacent nucleotide stretches, or both, respectively. The tile colors correspond to an individual's genotype. The right panel shows the fraction of the undocumented allele assignments out of the gene assignments. The x-axis is the fraction and the Y-axis is the same as in (a). Colors correspond to an individual's genotype of the allele. The shapes correspond to the number of gene assignments: a circle indicates that the number of gene assignments is less than 10, a triangle indicates that the number of gene assignments is between 10 and 30, and a square indicates that the number of gene assignments is more than 30. (b) Documented alleles versus the observed documented alleles and the undocumented alleles for each TRBV gene and in each data-set, DS1 and DS2, DS3, and DS4, respectively. The x-axis corresponds to the TRBV genes and the y-axis to the number of alleles. The color corresponds to the allele groups, dark red is the documented alleles, light red is the observed documented alleles, and blue is the observed undocumented alleles. morphisms in four genes (Fig. 3a ). TRBV4-3 and TRBV3-2 are absent from the genotypes 197 of eight individuals, while TRBV11-1 is absent from two individuals, and TRBV30 from one 198 individual (Fig. 3b) . In DS2, a similar data-set to DS1 from the point of view of sequence 199 length of the coding region, double chromosome deletions of TRBV4-3 were identified in 200 eight individuals, TRBV3-2 in two individuals, and TRBV7-3 in one individual (Supp. Fig. 3 ). 201 Interestingly, the individual from DS1 with an inferred TRBV30 deletion (HC10) was shown to 202 be homozygous or hemizygous for the undocumented allele TRBV30*03 T285C. On the as- 203 sumption that this undocumented allele is found at relatively low frequency within the human 204 population, homozygosity is unlikely. However, it is possible that the undocumented allele 205 has escaped more widespread detection because of its low usage level. This low usage 206 is a consequence of TRBV30*03 T285C being a pseudogene, because its coding region 207 includes an in-frame stop codon. HC10 therefore has at least the functional equivalent of a 208 double chromosome deletion. 209 The gene TRBV4-3 and the pseudogene TRBV3-2 were always inferred as being deleted 210 together in DS1 individuals (Fig. 3b) age of TRBV6-2*01/TRBV6-3*01. In individuals who lack TRBV4-3 and TRBV3-2, usage of 217 TRBV6-2*01/TRBV6-3*01 is significantly lower than in the individuals who express TRBV4-3 218 and TRBV3-2 (Supp. Fig. 13 ). It is therefore likely that detection of TRBV6-2*01/TRBV6-219 3*01 in these individuals is entirely a consequence of sequences utilizing TRBV6-3*01. This 220 line of reasoning also allowed us to conclude that an undocumented polymorphism seen in 221 sample HC4 is most likely an allele of TRBV6-3 (TRBV6-3*01 G47A) rather than TRBV6-222 2. The genotypes of all individuals who carry the TRBV6-2*01/TRBV6-3*01 2 or TRBV6-223 3*01 G47A 5'UTR sequences, include TRBV7-2*02. Since the presence of TRBV7-2*02 224 hints at deletion of TRBV6-2, we conclude that the TRBV6-2*01/TRBV6-3*01 2 5'UTR se-225 quences is attributed to TRBV6-3*01. 226 In DS2 individuals, deletion of V4-3 was not always accompanied by evidence of deletion 227 of TRBV3-2. This is likely because DS2 was collected from different sources, and in some 228 data-sets non-productive sequences had been filtered out. Evidence of the presence or 229 absence of the TRBV3-2 pseudogene is therefore lacking. In other samples, analysis of 230 TRBV3-2 usage is compromised by its low usage (Fig. 3a) .

This is the most likely error in 284 TRBJ genotyping, as TRBJ1-6*01 is the only TRBJ gene with two known functional alleles. erozygous individuals (Fig. 4d) , indicating that the TRBJ1-6 alleles can be reliably inferred. 287 Of note, in heterozygous individuals TRBJ1-6*02 is considerably more frequently used 288 compared with TRBJ1-6*01 (Fig. 4d) . The average fraction of TRBJ1-6*01 out of all se-289 quences assigned to TRBJ1-6 in heterozygous individuals is \u223c 0.39, which is comparable 290 with the average fraction of TRBD2*01 out of all sequences assigned to TRBD2 in TRBD2 291 heterozygous individuals after correcting for mis-assignments (see above). The similarity 292 between the biased usage of TRBJ1-6 and TRBD2 alleles in heterozygous individuals led 293 us to test the genetic dependency between these loci. 294 The distance between TRBJ1-6 to TRBD2 is relatively short (\u223c6000bp), suggesting 295 these loci could indeed be in linkage disequilibrium (LD). To test this hypothesis, we reviewed 296 Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) records from the 1000 Genomes Project to profile the 297 region's variants based on TRBD2 haplotype (Supp. Fig. 12) . We observed SNPs with 298 a high LD score between the genes. Further, the WGS haplotypes showed several other 299 SNPs with high LD score scattered in the TRBD-TRBC2 genomic region, which strengthens 300 the association between TRBD2 alleles and other markers in the locus. DS4 was unsuitable 301 to test this hypothesis because DS4 sequences do not include the SNP that differentiates 302 between TRBJ1-6*01 and TRBJ1-6*02. We therefore tested the LD hypothesis using DS3. 303 Only genotypes for which we were confident of the TRBD2 genotype were taken into ac-304 count. These genotypes are shown outside the gray areas of Fig. 4b . Supp. Fig. 9 shows 305 that all of the homozygous TRBD2*01 individuals are also homozygous for TRBJ1-6*02. 306 Also, 50 out of the 52 homozygous TRBJ1-6*01 individuals are homozygous for TRBD2*02. 307",

Since such an investi-310 gation requires accurate TRBD2 genotype inference, accurate annotations of TRBJ genes, 311 and a large data-set, DS4 was used. 312 We found that homozygous TRBD2*02 individuals tend to use TRBD2 1.25 times more 313 than homozygous TRBD2*01 individuals (Fig. 5a, TRBJ2 genes normalized independently for each gene family (Fig. 5c) . Surprisingly, we 325 found that TRBJ usage within each family is also affected by the TRBD2 genotype. Since 326 TRBD2 can rearrange only with TRBJ2 genes, we stratified the above distributions into sub-327 sets that include only biologically possible rearrangements. In particular, Fig. 5d shows the 328 conditional probability P(TRBJ2-N|TRBD2) for all the TRBJ2 genes. The biased usage of 329 the TRBJ2 genes observed in Fig. 5c is still present, indicating that TRBD2 relative likelihood 330 to recombine with TRBJ2 genes is strongly affected by the TRBD2 genotype. We then ex-331 plored the TRBJ gene fraction of the sequences assigned to TRBD1 (P(TRBJ1/2-N|TRBD1), 332 Fig. 5e ), and observed that TRBD2 genotype is associated with the TRBD1 likelihoods to re-333 12 arrange with individual TRBJ genes. We further investigated the effect of TRBD2 genotype 334 on the likelihoods to rearrange with individual TRBJ2 genes only, and the effect was mostly 335 eliminated P(TRBJ2-N|TRBD1), Fig. 5f ). 336 The strong biases observed in Fig.5a -e can result from amino acid alterations in the se-337 quence, from non-coding regulatory variants, or from unknown structural variations in the 338 locus that are associated with the different alleles. To discriminate between these options, 339 we repeated the analysis for non-functional sequences that resulted from frame-shifts be-340 tween the TRBV and TRBJ genes. Such non-functional sequences are commonly used to 341 reflect the initial V(D)J usage prior to thymus selection [12, 68, 59]. In these non-functional 342 sequences the biases are pronounced in a similar fashion (Supp. Fig. 11 ). Thus, we con-343 clude that the differences between the TRBD and TRBJ rearrangements stratified by D2 344 genotype are most likely due to structural differences or non-coding regulatory variants be-345 tween the loci rather than due to negative selection. .

In 11 out of 12 individuals with a high genotype infer-362 ence likelihood, the pattern between homozygosity of TRBV7-2*bp02 (see section 4.3) and 363 a deletion inference of TRBV4-3 was apparent (Supp. Fig. 14 and 15 ). Another gene with 364 a link to TRBV7-2 is TRBV6-2/TRBV6-3. Its usage was also highly affected by the geno-365 type of TRBV7-2. The mean usage of TRBV6-2/TRBV6-3 in TRBV7-2*bp02 homozygous 366 individuals was less than half of the mean usage in TRBV7-2*bp01 homozygous individu-367 als. Since we cannot distinguish between TRBV6-2 and TRBV6-3, this observation supports 368 the hypothesis that both TRBV6-2 and TRBV4-3, are not present in haplotypes that carry 369 TRBV7-2*bp02. 370 In addition, the following association patterns between specific alleles and single chromo- TRBV24-1*02 was present on chromosome TRBJ1-6*02, TRBV20-1*02 was also observed. 377 Of note is a haplotype block between the genes TRBV6-4 to TRBV10-1, that was observed 378 in DS1:CI21 on the TRBJ1-6*01 chromosome and in DS2:donor4 on the TRBJ1-6*02 chro-379 mosome (Fig. 6) . q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q TRBJ gene q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q fraction of TRBJ2 genes out of the sequences that were assigned to TRBD2 and were longer than 7nt.

Although the number of recombinations of 384 TRBD2 with the TRBV genes is much larger than TRBJ1-6 and could potentially supply a 385 better inference, comparison of the results from both anchor genes shows a different picture. 386 The haplotypes inferred with TRBD2 commonly show occurrences of more than one allele 387 per gene on a single chromosome. This is most likely due to ambiguous assignment of the 388 very short and similar TRBD2 alleles. Hence, although haplotype inference with TRBD2 is 389 feasible, it is likely to be less accurate. Table 9 . The data-sets are described in Table. 2. DS2 and DS4 were 399 downloaded after preprocessing, DS1 was preprocessed according to the preprocessing of 400 Eliyahu et al. [14] , and DS3 was preprocessed using pRESTO [63] according to the example 401 workflow \"Illumina MiSeq 2x250 BCR mRNA\" as follows, (i) paired-ends were assembled, 402 (ii) sequences with low quality (mean Phred quality scores lower than 20) were removed, (iii) 403 the 3' and 5' end primers were cut, (iv) duplicate sequences were removed and collapsed. 405 Sequences of two full-length TRBV genes, TRBV6-2*01 and TRBV6-3*01, are indistinguish-406 able (Fig. 1c) . We therefore refer to them here as TRBV6-2*01/TRBV6-3*01. TRBV se-407 quences amplified using the BIOMED-2 primers are partial, yet it is still possible to differen-408 tiate most of the genes. Only TRBV6-2 and TRBV6-3, as well as TRBV12-3 and TRBV12-4 409 could not be differentiated (Fig. 1c) . Those partial genes are referred to here as TRBV6- and TRBV6-5/TRBV6-6 were indistinguishable. (Fig. 1c) . Although there are few ambiguities in the identification of partial TRBV genes, the unam-424 biguous identification of partial allelic variants is more problematic. Many SNPs that distin-425 guish between alleles are located outside the regions that are generated using BIOMED-2 426 or Adaptive Biotechnologies primers. Thus, all alleles were collapsed into partial allelic vari-427 ation groups, the sequence of each partial allelic variation group was determined to be iden-428 tical to the longest allele sequence reference (out of the identical partial alleles' references). 429 The allele patterns were named here using the following structure: [gene name]*[protocol 430 primers][0-9][0-9]. The BIOMED-2 partial allelic variants were symbolized by bp, and the 431 Adaptive Biotechnologies partial allelic variants were symbolized by ap. For example, the 432 partial sequence of the allele TRBV5-6*01 was collapsed into the partial allelic variation 433 groups TRBV5-6*bp01 and TRBV5-6*ap01 (see Supplementary Table 8 with mismatches in the TRBD segment or with identifiable TRBD sequences shorter than 9 464 nucleotides were filtered out. 465 TIgGER's level of confidence was calculated using a Bayes factor (K) from the poste- 466 rior probability for each model. The larger the K, the greater the certainty in the genotype 467 inference. lk that is used throughout the manuscript indicates the log of K. \u03c3 1 ) and X 2 \u223c N 2 (\u00b5 2 , \u03c3 2 ), the equilibrium point x is determined as follows:",

The epsilon error parameter was adjusted to deal with TRBD2 alignment 510 errors, and was estimated with reference to the frequency distribution of TRBD2*01 align-511 ments amongst all TRBD2-bearing sequences (see Fig. 4 genotypes and haplotypes would be obscured. This study shows, however, that the usage of 596 particular genes in the expressed repertoire appears to be very similar between individuals. 597 The 'shape' of the TCR repertoire may therefore be as predictable as has been found for 598 20 the BCR repertoire [23, 52], reflecting both the carriage of individual genes and the LD that 599 is found within the loci. Conspicuous LD identified in this study includes that of the TRBV4-600 3/TRBV3-2/TRBV6-2 deletion polymorphism and carriage of the TRBV7-2*02 allele, as well 601 as linkage between the TRBD2 and TRBJ1-6 loci. These different haplotypes, in turn, are 602 associated with significant differences in the usage of neighbouring genes. for specific allelic variants of these genes could not be explored. Interestingly, in the present 622 study a previously undocumented polymorphism of TRBV12-4 was identified. 623 The lack of disease associations with TCR genes is likely to be a reflection of our ig-624 norance of individual genetic variation within the TCR loci. SNP coverage of these regions 625 is even sparser than coverage of the BCR gene loci, and therefore real associations will 626 escape detection in genome-wide association studies. Only after thorough exploration of 627 the population genetics of the TCR genes, and of individual variation in the expressed TCR 628 repertoire, will it be possible to determine whether or not these genes have a role in disease 629 susceptibility. Genomic sequencing of TCR genes will contribute to this [32], but the present 630 study demonstrates that it will also be possible to do this efficiently through the analysis of ",

Both genes are short and highly similar. TRBD1 234 is 12bp long, and TRBD2 is 16bp long. Each sequence includes a short central motif 235 flanked by G-rich ends. A single G/A SNP that is flanked by runs of Gs differentiates the two 236 TRBD2 alleles. During VDJ rearrangement, the ends of the TRBD segment are trimmed, 237 and P-nucleotides and N-nucleotides are added between the joining TRBV, TRBD and TRBJ 238 genes [41]. Studies of N-nucleotide addition in BCR V(D)J genes shows the process to be 239 biased towards addition of Gs, and addition of homopolymer tracts [26]. The unequivocal 240 identification of germline-encoded nucleotides within the TCR\u03b2 V(D)J junctions is therefore 241 problematic, and this is particularly true for the TRBD gene ends.

To inspect the 349 link between TRBV7-2*02 and the lack of usage of TRBV4-3, we turned to haplotype infer-350 ence. In an analogous way to the haplotyping methods for B cell receptor data[28, 45], a 351 heterozygous TRBD or TRBJ gene was needed as an anchor for TRBV haplotype inference.352    A suitable candidate is TRBJ1-6, for which 11 individuals from DS1(Fig 3e)and 8 individ-353 uals from DS2 (Supp.Fig. 3) are heterozygous. In 7 individuals who are heterozygous 354 for TRBV7-2, the chromosome that carried the allele 02 of this gene had a both support the association between TRBV7-2 genotype and the us-358 age of TRBV4-3. To strengthen this effect, we surveyed individual genotype and haplotype 359 inferences in DS3.

It is possible that the deletions are 'functional'573 rather than structural, perhaps as a result of individual variations in recombination signal 574 sequences (RSS) or other regulatory elements. Certainly in a few individuals, a handful of 575 rearrangements of the genes in question were seen. For example, TRBV4-3 was usually 576 present in about 2% of all rearrangements, but in 8 individuals it was seen at unknown gene duplications were inferred in this study. This is in sharp 579 contrast to observations from studies of the heavy chain IGHV locus. Early RFLP-based 580 analyses pointed to duplications of sequences that came to be known as IGHV3-23 and 581 IGHV1-69 [57, 7, 53, 56, 54]. More recently, the duplication of these two genes and of three 582 other functional genes were confirmed, first by analysis of AIRR-Seq data [5] and then with 583 the publication of a second complete assembly of the IGHV locus in 2013 [66]. 584 It was not possible in this study to explore possible RSS variants, as RSS are lost from 585 the genome during VDJ recombination. On the other hand, 5' RACE data allows for the 586 exploration of variations in the 5' UTR, as has recently been reported from BCR repertoire 587 studies [38, 39]. 31 variants of the 5' UTR sequences of TRBV genes were identified in this 588 study -a similar level of variability to that seen in IGHV studies. The functional implications 589 of this kind of variation is yet to be determined. 590 The documentation of allelic variation and structural variation in the TCR gene loci will be 591 important there are clear consequences of such variation on the expressed TCR repertoire, 592 and if such variation can be shown to have consequences for the disease susceptibility of 593 different individuals.

To document TRBD2 misassignments, we examined the fraction 249 of TRBD2*01 assignments amongst all sequences unambiguously assigned to the TRBD2 250 gene. The observed frequencies defined three very distinct groups(Fig. 4a). In the first 251 group, TRBD2*01 assignments accounted for \u223c0.125 of the TRBD2 annotations, in the sec-, and in the third group \u223c0.95. We believe that individuals in the first group 253 are in fact homozygous for TRBD2*02, and all alignments to TRBD2*01 are in error. The 254 second group corresponds to individuals who are heterozygous for TRBD2, and the third 255 group is homozygous for TRBD2*01. The resulting frequency distribution of TRBD2 fits well was tri-modal and very similar to that in DS1(Fig. 4c). The homozygous TRBD2*01 group 262 is centered around a frequency of 0.96. The heterozygous group is centred around 0.45,263    and the homozygous TRBD2*02 group is centered around 0.12.

The germline genes that rearrange to produce TCRs are rarely accorded much importance. The multiple sets of TCR alpha, beta, gamma 520 and delta V, D and J genes each include many highly similar genes. This may have encour-521 aged the view that the astonishing processes of V(D)J recombination should generate much 522 the same kind of repertoire, no matter what germline genes are available to an individual. Germline TCR genes may also represent a blind-spot to the immunological community, because until recently they were so difficult to document in an individual, let alone in a 525 population. High throughput sequencing studies of the TCR repertoire now provide a new 526 avenue by which germline genes can be easily documented, for this study has shown that 527 tools and techniques that were developed for the analysis of individual BCR genotypes -the 528 sets of BCR encoding genes that are available for rearrangement [22, 19, 28, 46, 17, 29], 529 and individual haplotypes -the available chromosomal sets of IGHV genes [10, 45], can 530 easily be adapted for the analysis of TCR data-sets. Other tools such as LymAnalyzer have 531 been specifically developed for the analysis of TCR data [71]. Studies of BCR genotypes and haplotypes have led to the identification of dozens of new 533 allelic variants of heavy and light chain variable region genes. This approach has not pre-534 viously been extended to investigations of the TCR genes. The focus of most TCR gene 535 studies remains firmly fixed on the CDR3 regions of the genes [50]. Despite their interaction 536 with the MHC, and their documented influences on TCR/MHC/peptide interactions [34, 4], 537 the CDR1 and CDR2 gene sequences and their translated products are still generally ig-538 nored in TCR repertoire studies. Only the 3' ends of the TCR variable gene sequences 539 are included in the amplicons generated by commercial providers of TCR sequencing such 540 as BGI, iRepertoire and Adaptive Biotechnologies. Their sequencing setup allows the un-541 ambiguous identification of most variable region genes that may partially encode the CDR3 542sequences, but they are rarely able to identify TRBV genes at the allele level. In this study,543    we have explored how TCR VDJ sequences of different lengths, generated using differing544    technologies, can contribute to our knowledge of TRB genes and their allelic variants.Our analysis demonstrates that many undocumented V genes remain to be discovered,546    and that even short read sequences can be analysed for the detection of undocumented 547 polymorphisms. It is clear, however, that much additional information is to be gained by548    19 the study of full length VDJ genes. Analysis of genotypes and haplotypes from full-length 549 sequence data-sets of 53 individuals led to the identification of 18 TRBV alleles that are 550 not documented in the IMGT Reference Directory. In contrast, only 13 polymorphisms were 551 identified in truncated sequences generated from 313 individuals using BIOMED-2 primers,552    and just 16 new SNPs were seen in the 786 Adaptive Biotechnology data-sets. This latter 553 result reflects both the very short lengths of the Adaptive Biotechnology sequences, and the 554 general lack of variability in the 3' ends of the TRBV genes.It is interesting to contrast this level of gene discovery with genetic variation amongst the BCR-encoding genes: to date, 64 functional alleles are documented in IMGT for 48 TRBV 557 genes (avg. 1.33 alleles per gene). This compares to 286 functional alleles reported for the 558 55 IGHV genes (avg. 5.2 alleles per gene). This study adds a total of 38 alleles and SNPs 559 to the record of TRBV genes, and it seems likely that many undocumented TRBV alleles 560 remain to be discovered.It appears that there is less structural variation in the TRBV locus than is seen in the 562 IGHV locus. A well-documented 21Kb deletion polymorphism in the TRBV locus, involving TRBV30 -were seen at relatively low frequencies. No deletion polymorphisms involving the 566 TRBD or TRBJ loci were detected. In contrast, numerous relatively common indels are now 567 known in the IGH loci, including one involving 13 consecutive, functional IGHV genes, and 568 one involving 6 consecutive IGHD genes[28, 22]. The seven functional IGHV genes that 569 can be found between IGHV4-28 and IGHV4-34 are rarely all present, or all absent, with at 570 least six recognized indel patterns[22, 49].",

This 606 study demonstrates that meaningful analysis of TRBD genes is possible, and that even the607 slight sequence variations between the TRBD genes have consequences for the expressed 608 repertoire. Within large VDJ data-sets, TRBD genes can be identified with confidence, and 609 even the presence of different TRBD2 alleles in an individual's genotype can shape the 610 expressed repertoire in predictable ways. As our knowledge of these and other genes of the TCR loci grows, the way will be open to identify 'departures from the repertoire norm' that 612 may have biological and perhaps even clinical implications. To date, there have been very few associations of TCR genes with disease. One clear example is the genetic predisposition to carbamazepine-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome 615 (SJS), a severe cutaneous hypersensitivity with high mortality [8]. SJS and other cutaneous 616 hypersensitivity reactions have been linked to HLA types, but these associations have all 617 had a low positive predictive value [43], leading others to explore a possible role for TCR 618 genes.
