We find that some teleworkers earn a wage premium, but it varies by gender, parental status, and teleworking intensity. Fathers who telework earn more than fathers in office-based jobs, regardless of teleworking intensity. Women without children who telework occasionally earn more than their office counterparts. In industries and occupations where telework is more prevalent, mothers who work from home most days of the week pay a wage penalty compared to mothers in office-based jobs. Using time diaries, we find differences in work patterns and hours across worker groups that could drive these teleworker wage differentials. Most teleworkers work less on home days; however, those who earn wage premiums are working longer hours on weekdays, regardless of their work location. When teleworking, mothers experience more interruptions in their workdays than other workers, which could have negative effects on their productivity. We also find that teleworkers spend less time on commuting and grooming activities but more time on leisure activities and with family on work-at-home days than on office days, and female teleworkers spend more time sleeping and on household production activities.",

            "text": "Over the two decades preceding the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of U.S. workers working from home rose steadily, propelled by advances in communications technology and an expansion of high-speed internet services (Pabilonia & Vernon, 2021) . In 2017-2018, according to the American Time Use Survey Leave and Job Flexibilities (ATUS-LV) Module, 25 percent of wage and salary workers did some of their work at home, while 13 percent of workers worked exclusively from home at least once every two weeks (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2019) . Following the declaration by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020 that the novel coronavirus outbreak was a pandemic, many workers were pushed into home offices, at least temporarily, in an attempt to slow the spread of the virus. 1 By early May 2020, 35 percent of employed persons reported that they had worked from home at some point in the past four weeks because of the pandemic and, according to the 2020 ATUS, 42 percent of employed persons did some work from home on days worked between May and December 2020 (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2021a; 2021b) . 2 Many experts believe that this dramatic relocation of work from office to home because of the pandemic will have a lasting impact on the location of work. Dingel and Neiman (2020) estimate that up to 37 percent of all U.S. jobs held at the beginning of 2020 could feasibly be done entirely from home, while Barrero et al. (2020) predict that 22 percent of all full workdays will be supplied from home after the pandemic ends. This shift in the share of the labor force teleworking is likely to be permanent, because of better-than-expected experiences working from home (WFH) during the pandemic, investments in physical and human capital to support WFH, and diminished stigma associated with WFH. Thus, the post-COVID-19 era will likely be an era of telework, with many more workers working most of their workdays from home.",

The flexibility allowed by telework may improve worker and family well-being if the time that would have been spent commuting can be devoted to more useful or enjoyable activities, such as social interactions, household production, or child care. Parents who work from home report that their number one reason for doing so is to coordinate their work schedule with their personal or family needs (Woods, 2020) . If WFH makes workers happier and allows them to better balance their work and home responsibilities, it may lead to higher productivity and higher wages. WFH can also lead to higher productivity if workers are better able to concentrate on their job tasks in a home setting, because they are not interrupted as often by coworkers or they have eliminated their taxing commutes and/or reallocated some of their time to sleeping or other relaxing leisure activities.",

Our paper is novel because we investigate the relationships between telework, wages, and time use by teleworking intensity while prior researchers have focused on the relationship between remote work and wages only for home-based workers (for example, Oettinger, 2011; White, 2019) or the relationship between remote work and time allocation without regard to the number of days worked at home per week (for example, Gim\u00e9nez-Nadal et al. 2019; Song & Gao 2020) . We also examine heterogeneity in the relationship between telework and wages by gender and parental status and explore one mechanism that potentially links wages to WFH, namely the allocation of time.",

This module allows us to determine whether a worker can work some or all their workdays exclusively from home on their main job, and how often. In our analyses, we divide regular teleworkers into two types: home-based teleworkers, who work three or more days a week exclusively from home, and occasional teleworkers, who work exclusively at home at least once every two weeks but fewer than three days a week. When we refer to office workers, we mean workers whose location of work is at a traditional worksite for their occupation and industry, which is not necessarily an office setting. By definition, office workers seldom work exclusively from home on their workday, but they may do some work at home in addition to the work they do at their worksite.",

To examine how teleworkers choose to reallocate their time savings when WFH, we compare conditional mean time use and the timing of daily activities on weekday workdays for teleworkers on home days versus office days, and also compare the time allocation of teleworkers and office workers. We then examine time use on all days to compare how time-use patterns vary by type of worker in order to investigate whether teleworkers differ from office workers in how much time they spend on various activities over the week.",

Furthermore, worker happiness is tied to productivity (Oswald et al., 2015) . Some of the time savings from reducing commutes could be reallocated to sleeping, and more time sleeping would have a positive effect on productivity and wages (Gibson & Shrader, 2018; Groen & Pabilonia, 2019) .

Using the ATUS Well-Being Module, Song and Gao (2020) find that teleworking increases fathers' stress levels and lowers mothers' happiness compared to working in a traditional workplace setting, but there are no differences in instantaneous stress or happiness levels for men and women without children. Teleworkers' work hours may also spill over into nontraditional work hours and cause conflicts with other family members. In addition, teleworkers with competing demands on their time may shirk while on the clock. During core work hours, children and chores may call for attention, leading to interruptions in workers' workflow and potentially differentially affecting mothers' and fathers' productivity. Analyzing the wages of home-based teleworkers on the popular gender-blind online labor platform, Amazon Mechanical Turk, Adams-Prassl (2021) finds a large gender wage gap among parents that results from differences in working patterns. While not evidence of shirking because workers in this case are paid piece rate, mothers complete fewer consecutive tasks in a work session and are more likely to take longer breaks between adjacent tasks on the online platform, with negative effects on their task completion speed and potentially their productivity.",

From an employer's standpoint, telework arrangements are easier to implement when workers do not require costly supervision or coordination, where teamwork is less important and output is easily measured, and in jobs where workers have more autonomy. If monitoring is costly, managers may grant telecommuting rights to their most trusted and highly productive workers, who have a lower propensity to shirk; however, White's (2019) findings suggest that the costs of monitoring have fallen over the past 40 years. Alternatively, they may pay efficiency wages to elicit greater effort when monitoring is problematic. 3 In areas where office space is more expensive, employers have an additional incentive to encourage WFH with monetary incentives. On the other hand, employers who place a higher value on teamwork may encourage on-site presence with higher wages or promotions, leading to lower wage trajectories for teleworkers even with no differences in individual worker productivity (Rhee, 2008; Bloom et al., 2015; Glass & Noonan, 2016) .",

            "text": "Whether teleworking leads to higher or lower wages is ultimately an empirical question. Prior studies provide mixed evidence on the wage effects of WFH in the U.S., though they vary in how they classify teleworkers, with some including those bringing supplemental work home from the office to catch-up on unfinished projects and others examining only home-based teleworkers. Most use cross-sectional data and do not account for selection effects. Using the 2001 and 2004 Current Population Survey Work Schedules and Work at Home (CPS-WS) Supplements, Weeden (2005) finds a positive relationship between flexible work arrangements and wages, with higher wage premiums in nonmanual occupations. Using the 2001 CPS-WS Supplement, Gariety and Shaffer (2007) show wage premiums associated with WFH in some industries, but wage penalties in others. They attribute the negative wage differentials as being driven by workers' preferences for WFH and the positive differentials as being driven by WFH workers being more productive, either because employers allow their most productive workers to telework or because workers are more productive while WFH. Focusing on home-based workers, Oettinger (2011) documents wage penalties in the 1980 and 1990 Censuses and a small wage premium in the 2000 Census. Between 1980 and 1990, the wage penalties fell fastest in ITintensive occupations. More recently, using ACS and Decennial Census data and controlling for selection using a Heckman selection model, White (2019) finds that home-based workers went from paying a 26 percent wage penalty in 1980 to earning a 5 percent wage premium in 2014.",

They also find that fathers who ever work at home spend less time on primary child care. More recently, Genadek and Hill (2017) examine differences in parents' time with children under the age of 13 by different measures of workplace flexibility and find that mothers, but not fathers, who have work location flexibility spend more total time with their children (almost 50 min more) than mothers who do no work from home. Neither Wight and Raley (2009) nor Genadek and Hill (2017) distinguish between WFH days and days when work is brought home from the office and done in the evening; however, Eldridge and Pabilonia (2010) surmise that most of the work done at home in 2004 was work brought home from the office and done in the evening or over the weekend. Gim\u00e9nez-Nadal et al. (2019) and Song and Gao (2020) use ATUS data prior to the release of the ATUS-LV Module to examine the relationship between WFH and workers' subjective well-being.

Gim\u00e9nez-Nadal et al. (2019) , however, find that working exclusively from home on the diary day results in a shift from market work activities to nonmarket work and leisure activities during core working hours.",

Also using the ATUS-LV Module, Frazis (2020) examines the characteristics of all wage and salary workers who are ever paid to work exclusively at home on their workday, and studies how time is reallocated between activities when workers telework. He finds that teleworkers shift time from commuting and grooming activities to leisure and sleep and that secondary child-care time increases. While we use the same data, the focus of our study and our sample differ. We examine full-time, nonagricultural wage and salary workers in whitecollar occupations and classify workers based on their frequency of teleworking. We do not require workers who telework regularly to report being paid for their work at home (although 89 percent of teleworkers state they are paid for work done from home) because all workers are compensated for their work even if it is delayed compensation in terms of a promotion (Song 2009 ). 5 We consider only full-time workers in order to examine the relationships between work location flexibility, time use, and wages for workers who have more similar hours of work. In addition, we examine workers separately by gender, given the sizeable differences in both time allocation and occupations held by men and women (Aguiar & Hurst, 2007; Blau & Kahn, 2017) . 6",

Only one respondent per household is interviewed; however, the ATUS includes a household roster and demographic and labor market information for each respondent and all other household members, including age, education, employment, earnings, and usual weekly hours worked. In addition, one retrospective time diary is collected where the respondent sequentially details how she spent her time over a single 24-hour period starting at 4 a.m. on the day prior to the interview (start and stop times are reported for each activity). Activities are coded into detailed categories and, for most activities, both the location of the activity and who else was present during the activity are also available, except for sleep and personal care activities. Only the respondents' primary activities are recorded, except for secondary child care of children under age 13. We examine major time use categories, including work and work-related activities, travel, personal care, household production, care, and leisure activities and important subcategories, such as commuting, and summary measures of time with family, friends, and coworkers or clients.

The largest share of teleworkers by far is among computer and mathematical scientists (about 37 percent of women and 35 percent of men telework). We find significant gender differences in the proportion of teleworkers in some occupations, such as legal; community and social service; arts, design, entertainment, and sports; life, physical, and social science; and protective service occupations.

Because we want to compare wages and time use for workers in similar jobs by teleworker status, we further restrict the sample to those working in white-collar occupations, i.e., those occupations where workers could feasibly telework, for our subsequent analyses. 11 This sample includes those working in the following major occupation groups: management, business, and financial occupations; professional and related occupations; sales and related occupations; and office and administrative support occupations. 12 Altogether, 96 percent of teleworkers are in one of these occupational groupings.",

When the hourly wage is not directly reported, we calculate it as usual weekly earnings divided by usual weekly hours. 16 We multiply top-coded hourly wages and earnings by 1.5, a common practice in the literature (e.g., Autor et al., 2008) . Home-based teleworker i and Occasional teleworker i are binary variables for the category of teleworker; X i includes controls for the demographic and job characteristics of individual i; \u03b2 0 is a constant term; \u03b2 1 and \u03b2 2 are the coefficients of interest; \u03b2 3 is a vector of coefficients; and \u03b5 i represents the error term.

All existing studies, including this one, acknowledge the difficulty of disentangling a causal relationship between wages and work location arrangements. Our OLS estimates may be biased because of unobserved worker and/or firm heterogeneity that is correlated with both wages and teleworker status. For example, individuals with better negotiation skills or advanced computer training may be both more likely to work from home and receive higher wages. Thus, the coefficients on the teleworker variables would combine the effects of WFH with the impact of these skills on wages and thus will overestimate the true impact of remote work on wages. As another example, Briscoe et al. (2011) find a positive association between workplace size and the probability of WFH among high-skilled IT workers. Because larger firms pay higher wages than smaller firms (Bloom et al., 2018) , our OLS estimates are again likely to be biased upward.",

Oster (2019) suggests that R max = 1.3* e R is an adequate assumption based on a comparison of plausibly biased observational estimates with evidence on causal effects from randomized control trials. She argues that an R max = 1 is too high, especially if measurement error is likely. 19 In an exploratory analysis, we matched four months of diaries from the ATUS-LV Module (April-July 2018) to the January 2018 CPS Job Tenure Supplement. Job tenure was higher for men who were teleworkers but lower for women who were teleworkers, compared to their office counterparts (9.0 years vs. 7.2 years for men and 7.2 years vs. 8.5 years for women). However, the job tenure differences by teleworker status were not statistically significantly different, likely due to the smaller sample sizes. In addition, the male teleworkers in this smaller matched sample had noticeably higher average wages than those in the main analysis sample, so it is not surprising that they also had higher tenure. Thus, it is not apparent from this analysis that employers are granting telework based on job seniority, at least they are not doing so for women. who worked at least four hours on their diary day. 20 Similar to N\u00e4tti et al. (2011) , we control for various background characteristics that are correlated with differences in time allocation.

Table 3 presents OLS coefficient estimates and Oster betas. In most instances, the OLS coefficients represent the upper bound. For the average worker (column 1), we find that male home-based teleworkers earn more than male office workers (an 8-15 percent wage premium), while female home-based teleworkers do not earn a wage premium. 23 However, for the average female worker (Panel B, column 1), we find that female occasional teleworkers earn a wage premium of 7-16 percent. While the coefficient on occasional teleworker for the average male worker is statistically significant and shows a 9 percent wage premium, the estimate is not robust to correcting for omitted variable bias, as the Oster beta is negative. In a robustness check, we pool male and female workers and include interactions between our teleworker variables and gender in equation 1. The coefficient on the gender interaction term with home-based teleworker is negative, of similar magnitude as the coefficient on home-based teleworker, and statistically significant. The coefficient on the gender interaction term with occasional teleworker, however, is not statistically significant and close to zero (see Appendix Table 7 ). Looking at the results by parental status (Table 3 , columns 2 and 3), we find that fathers who are home-based teleworkers earn 11-15 percent more than fathers who are office workers, and fathers who are occasional teleworkers earn 11-19 percent more than fathers who are office workers. Because the OLS estimates are similar for fathers, we estimate a specification with a teleworker indicator and its interaction with home-based teleworker and cannot reject the hypothesis that the teleworker wage differential is the same regardless of their teleworking intensity (results not shown). Men without children who are home-based teleworkers earn 9-16 percent more than men without children who are office workers; however, the coefficient is not statistically significant at conventional levels, which is likely because of the smaller sample size. Men without children who are occasional teleworkers do not earn a wage premium, while women without children who are occasional teleworkers earn 14-23 percent more than women without children who are office workers. Women without children who are home-based teleworkers do not earn a wage premium. Mothers who telework either occasionally or most of their days also do not earn a wage premium.",

In the occupation specifications (columns 7-9), we again find that fathers earn more if they telework and women without children earn more if they occasionally telework, although with the smaller sample size, the former is not statistically significant for home-based teleworkers. We also observe a new result in the top industries and top occupations specifications-mothers who are home-based teleworkers pay a wage penalty of 14-22 percent. This result is consistent with either a negative productivity story resulting from greater interruptions from children during the workday or mothers' willingness to accept lower wages for the option to work from home to better balance work and home responsibilities.",

We also show time working with children present, secondary child care, and the number of work episodes.

However, on average, teleworkers on home days work about 27 min less on their main jobs than on-site workers. While on office days teleworkers and office workers have similar hours of work, we see that teleworkers on their office days do relatively more of their work from home (34 min versus 10 min). Looking at daily work hours across worker type and location by parental status, we find that teleworking men without children work about 40 min less on home days than on-site workers, while teleworking fathers work 35 min less on home days than office days and 18 min less than fathers who are office workers (only the differences for men without children are statistically significant). Comparing hours across parental status, we find that fathers work longer hours in each worker group, especially fathers who are teleworkers. On WFH days, fathers work 33 min longer than men without children. On office days, fathers who are teleworkers work 25 min longer than men without children who are teleworkers, while fathers who are office workers work only 11 min longer than men without children who are office workers.

Female teleworkers also work less at their main jobs on home days than on office days (26 min less), but the difference is not statistically significant.

On WFH days, women without children work 81 min longer than mothers. Among teleworkers on office days, women without children work 56 min longer than mothers. Among those in office-based jobs, women without children work 21 min longer than mothers. In addition, among teleworkers, the hours of women without children are even higher than the hours of fathers. Like male teleworkers, female teleworkers and office workers spend similar amounts of time with coworkers and clients on office days. Consistent with prior research by Adams-Prassl (2021), mothers have slightly more work episodes than fathers on WFH days, 3.5 versus 3.2 episodes, while women without children only have 2.6 work episodes on WFH days. It is possible that the greater number of interruptions in their work could lead to mothers being less productive at work, which could explain the teleworker wage penalty for mothers in some occupations and industries. The wage premium for women without children who are occasional teleworkers is consistent with their working longer hours. Working longer hours on weekday workdays with few interruptions for nonwork activities may be especially valued by firms if coordination of work activities with coworkers during core business hours is important (Cubas et al., 2021) .",

Thus, full-time employed mothers may select themselves into jobs that do not require long hours, thus forgoing compensation and promotion but gaining better work-life balance.",

We find a few noteworthy differences from our weekday workday results and between our two teleworker types. (See Appendix Tables 9A and B for the full set of results). On the average day, male teleworkers and male office workers work the same amount of time, suggesting neither overworking nor shirking by teleworkers (but some shifting of work time), which is contrary to prior researchers' findings based on non-diary survey data that suggests teleworkers work longer hours (Noonan & Glass, 2012) . Only male home-based teleworkers spend less time commuting than male office workers (20 min less). This suggests that the commute may be slightly longer for male occasional teleworkers than male office workers, which de Vos et al. (2018) and de Vos et al. (2019) found to be true for some workers in the Netherlands. 28 Fathers who are home-based teleworkers spend 19-21 min more on primary child care and about 1.8 h more on secondary child care than fathers who are occasional teleworkers or office-based workers. We also do not find any differences in TV and computer time on the average day across worker types, suggesting that men prefer to spend the same amount of time watching TV, playing video games, and engaging on social media but teleworkers do more of these activities on their WFH weekdays while office workers do more of these activities on non-workdays.",

In Fig. 3 , we observe that most workers in all three groups are working during traditional core working hours (8 a.m. to 5 p.m.), with a large dip in the share of all workers working at lunchtime. However, male teleworkers are slightly less likely to be working in the afterschool hours (3-5 p.m.) on WFH days than on office days, although they are just as likely to be working on office days as office workers during those hours (Panel A). This could explain why teleworkers' work time on weekday workdays is less than the work time of on-site workers. Male teleworkers on WFH days are more likely to be doing household production and care activities and spending time with children during these after-school hours (Figs. 4 and 5) . For example, consider the 4 p.m. diary time. At 4 p.m., 74 percent of male teleworkers on office days are working, while only 58 percent of male teleworkers on WFH days are working (Fig. 3 Panel A) . Twenty-two percent of male teleworkers on WFH days are doing household production and care activities (Fig. 4 Panel A), while only five percent of male teleworkers on office days are doing these activities.

This suggests that WFH allows workers' waking hours to shift to later in the day, i.e., they wake later and go to sleep later, which may be a sign that standard work schedules do not sync with circadian rhythms or that night owls select telework. On average, male teleworkers on WFH days wake up at 6:36 a.m. but on office days they wake up at 6:17 a.m., while female teleworkers on WFH days wake up at 6:48 a.m. but on office days they wake up at 6:05 a.m. (19 and 43 min earlier on office days, respectively) ( Table 5 ). The latter difference in female wake times also corresponds with the earlier finding that female teleworkers get more sleep on WFH days. On non-workdays, all worker types wake up at similar times, suggesting that night owls do not select into telework. Thus, there may be positive productivity effects resulting from increased sleep and quality of sleep on WFH days because of differences in the timing of sleep.",

Only women without children under age 18 who occasionally work from home still earn a wage premium, while mothers who work most days of the week at home pay a wage penalty in some occupations and industries. Thus, our results suggest that increasing the number of telework days for women will not reduce the gender wage gap or motherhood wage gap, although it may still improve mothers' well-being and possibly even allow some mothers to take part in the labor force who otherwise would not. On the other hand, increasing the frequency of telework may even increase the motherhood wage gap, because our results suggest higher wage premiums for fathers who are home-based teleworkers. We also find that fathers earn wage premiums when they occasionally work from home. Our results showing differences between teleworking mothers and fathers are consistent with prior research showing that mothers are more willing to pay for location flexibility and they may have lower productivity when working remotely because of interruptions throughout their workdays. Mothers who telework take more breaks throughout their workdays and are potentially interrupted more by their children who are more likely to be in their presence while they work from home. We also do not find that men without children earn a wage premium for teleworking once we control for observables, such as education and job characteristics, which vary by parental status. From the time diaries, we find evidence that the above-mentioned groups of teleworkers who earn wage premiums are working longer hours on weekday workdays than the groups of teleworkers who do not earn wage premiums, which is consistent with previous researchers' finding that those working long hours earn a wage premium and that those who work in occupations that require the coordination of activities during core business hours also earn a wage premium.",

Workers may be more alert on their jobs when they can skip their morning commutes and other preparations for going into the office, resulting in higher productivity on their WFH days. Female workers get more sleep on WFH days, which may also boost their productivity. Our results suggesting no statistically significant difference in work time on the average day by worker type lead us to conclude that workers are not shirking on the job or being overworked as the boundaries between work and home life blur. Teleworkers also spend more time watching TV and using the computer for leisure on their WFH days than office days, though not on the average day. This suggests that teleworkers adjust the timing of some activities over the days of the week, which also could enhance their well-being. Female teleworkers, but not male teleworkers, use some of their time windfall from the elimination of their long commutes to do more household production activities on their WFH days. However, it is possible that an expansion of telework could decrease the gender care gap, because fathers spend more time on primary child care when they work from home while mothers do not, and fathers who are home-based teleworkers spend relatively more time on secondary child care on the average day than occasional teleworkers and office workers.",
