Similarly, the PALOMA-3 trial studied the combination of palbociclib and fulvestrant, resulting in a median PFS of 9.5 months compared with 4.6 months in the placebo-fulvestrant group (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.36-0.59, p < 0.0001) [11] .

            "text": "Various side effects have been associated with CDK4/6 inhibitors, including hematological toxicities, gastrointestinal effects, and cutaneous adverse reactions [14, 15] . Neutropenia is the most common adverse effect of palbociclib and is managed through dose reductions, dose interruptions, or cycle delays [15] . Unlike systemic chemotherapy, neutropenia associated with palbociclib is rapidly reversible due to its cytostatic rather than cytotoxic effects on neutrophil precursors and rarely results in severe complications [16] . Palbociclib is conventionally dosed orally at 125 mg daily for 21 days, followed by a 7-day break for a total 28-day cycle. A complete blood count is recommended on days 1 and 15 for the first two cycles, and dose modifications are performed based on the manufacturer's monograph recommendations (Figure 1 ) [15] . In real-world settings, oncologists have deviated from conventional monograph dosing recommendations and varied their prescribing strategies in attempts to mitigate neutropenic effects, hoping to maintain palbociclib tolerability and extend overall treatment duration. Recent studies have reported real-world outcomes and described dosing modifications trends [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-world study assessing the direct impact of palbociclib off-monograph dosing modifications on PFS. With the increased adoption of alternative dosing strategies in practice, the effect on PFS of patients is unknown.",

Although this may reflect differences between a robust randomized trial and real-world practice, we believe the reduction in the severity of neutropenia may also be attributed to these alternative dosing strategies. For example, by extending the break duration of palbociclib to two weeks, neutrophil counts recover adequately and patients may resume treatment at the same dose level. Thus, this strategy exploits the cytostatic nature of neutropenia caused by CDK4/6 inhibition and is yet another advantage of the mechanisms targeting cell cycle arrest as opposed to traditional chemotherapy [16] .",

We identified seven unique alternative dosing strategies of palbociclib prescribed by oncologists at Trillium Health Partners. The Kaplan-Meier curves for PFS in patients receiving letrozole and palbociclib prescribed alternative dosing strategies appear to diverge from monograph dosing early in the treatment, while the frequency of grade 4 neutropenia was lower in the letrozole patients.
