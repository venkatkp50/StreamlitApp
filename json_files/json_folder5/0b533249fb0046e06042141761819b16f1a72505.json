However, developing treatments for COVID-19 relies on conducting clinical trials. Using telemedicine or virtual methods may support ongoing trials and limit the pandemic's impact on clinical research. Objective: To examine the use of virtual methods among ongoing and discontinued COVID-19 clinical trials. Design: In this cross-sectional analysis, we performed a systematic search of ClinicalTrials.gov for COVID-19 related trials registered since the pandemic began. In masked, duplicate fashion, authors extracted data from included studies, noting whether trialists reported using telecommunication, virtualization, or remote data collection to deliver interventions and monitor outcome measures. The authors also coded the use of virtual methods for recruitment, enrollment, or follow-up visits. Chi-square tests and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to assess differences in the use of virtual methods between ongoing and discontinued studies and differences between intervention types. Results: Our search returned 2549 clinical trials, of which 2383 were included. Of included studies, 2109 (88.5%) were ongoing and 274 (11.5%) were discontinued. Overall, 519 (24.6%) ongoing COVID-19 trials reported using virtual methods for trial conduct and 43 (15.7%) discontinued trials reported using virtual methods. There was a statistically significant difference in the rate of reporting virtual methods between discontinued and ongoing trials (X 2 1 = 27.2, P < .001). Studies listed as Behavioral or Other were more likely to report using virtual methods for delivering interventions compared to other intervention types (X 2 1 = 751.88, P < .001). Conclusions and relevance: The COVID-19 pandemic has presented an unprecedented need for safe and efficient clinical trial conduct. Nearly a quarter of ongoing COVID-19 clinical trials in our sample reported using virtual methods for supporting trial progress. Ongoing trials were more likely to report virtual methods compared to discontinued trials. Developing strategies that allow for continuing trials during emergencies may limit trial disruption. Exploring and developing remote trial methods may continue to be valuable in light of emerging COVID-19 variants and may persist beyond the pandemic.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted clinical trial (CT) conduct due to public safety measures such as lockdowns and mandatory closures [1] [2] [3] [4] . However, developing effective interventions for COVID-19 paradoxically depends on findings from CTs. Many trials have been suspended during the pandemic, often citing the pandemic as the primary reason for discontinuation. [5] McDermott and Newman suspect that ongoing trials, having not been suspended, are likely to face challenges with aspects of protocols requiring in-person contact in the absence of remote research methods. [5] Moreover, the United States Food and Drug Administration updated guidance on CT conduct during the pandemic focusing on ensuring participant safety and maintaining trial integrity, including using virtual visits, telecommunication, remote monitoring, and alternative methods of intervention delivery wherever possible. [6] Many trialists were able to quickly adapt trial protocols to include using telehealth and remote methods. For example, an Alzheimer's disease trial constructed networks to support remote monitoring for using tele-neuropsychiatric platforms during the pandemic. [7] In another case, a CT evaluating fluvoxamine and improved outcomes in COVID-19 patients was conducted using entirely remote methods. The study randomized participants via phone, delivered medical supplies for data collection by mail, and gathered data via manual input into electronic surveys by participants. [5] As the focus of clinical research has shifted toward COVID-19, and with new variants of concern arising, finding alternative ways to continue CTs remains an important objective, [8, 9] but the prevalence of using virtual methods among ongoing COVID-19 CTs remains unknown. Thus, the primary objective of this study was to assess the use of virtualization, telecommunication, and remote monitoring among ongoing and discontinued COVID-19 CTs.",

            "text": "We found that nearly a quarter of ongoing COVID-19 CTs registered on ClinicalTrials.gov at the time of our search reported using telecommunication, virtualization, or distancing for trial conduct. Mitigating the risk of infection via telecommunication or virtualization is key in protecting trial participant safety. [10] Additionally, telecommunication may increase efficiency within health care systems, allowing for smoother clinical trial conduct, [11] especially among trials without clinical sites. [12] Many clinical trial inefficiencies and design flaws were exposed by the urgent need for COVID-19 trials, and van Dorn asserts that virtual remedies will persist in trial conduct following the pandemic. [10] While many aspects of CTs are better suited for virtual adaptation, others are not easily transitioned and have inherent limitations. [13] For example, specimen collection and \"bench work\" are important aspects of clinical research that are less amenable to virtualization. [13] Our results possibly reflect these limitations --behavioral and 'other' interventions were significantly more likely than drug, procedural, and biological trials to report using virtualization. Many trials labeled as 'other' were entirely virtual and were likely labeled as such because ClinicalTrials.gov does not yet have 'telemedicine' as an intervention type. Interestingly, Cortez et al. found behavioral treatments to be more commonly delivered via virtual methods compared to other treatment types in office-based settings during the pandemic-a clinical equivalent of our findings. [14] Despite the limitations of virtualizing trials, the increased demand for virtualization may drive innovation and development of remote protocols and monitoring tools for use in clinical trials that will outlast the COVID-19 pandemic. [13] Even among inherently harder-to-virtualize interventions, such as surgery, the need for virtual adaptation secondary to the pandemic allowed for continual healthcare delivery, which will serve as a nidus for implementing virtual measures in the future. [15] We found that discontinued studies were less likely to report using virtual methods than ongoing studies, and while we cannot claim causality, we assert that virtualization may prevent premature trial disruption. It may also be that earlier studies were focused on interventions that are difficult to virtualize, such as drugs, and thus, discontinuation was difficult to avoid. While certain aspects of clinical trials are inherently more difficult to convert to remote methods, rapid innovation and adaptation of certain aspects of clinical trials during the COVID-19 pandemic may persist. For example, remote methods used during the pandemic may promote trial participation for individuals with comorbid medical conditions or travel restrictions that would otherwise be unable to participate [5] . Adapting trial methods to include the use of portable medical devices, mobile monitoring clinics, and video-administered testing may increase trial participation in the postpandemic era. While virtualization has been crucial in supporting trial progress during the COVID-19 pandemic, the safety and accuracy of remotely obtaining other data-usually collected in person-remains uncertain. [5] However, the importance of exploring and developing remote methods may continue to be valuable in light of continuously emerging COVID-19 variants.",

Further, we only extracted what was explicitly listed on ClinicalTrials.gov to assess for the use of virtual methods, and trialists may not have listed the use of virtual methods. Therefore, the actual prevalence of virtual methods may be underrepresented in our sample. Additionally, we searched for CTs within a limited time period, limiting generalizability. There are many reasons for discontinuing a trial including safety concerns, futility, drop outs or too frequent protocol violations, and failure to recruit. Only some of these reasons may be mitigated by remote methods, and the relationship between trial status and use of remote methods is purely correlational. Our study cannot establish any causal relationships, and our results should be interpreted accordingly. Lastly, while we reported the overall rate of using remote methods for secondary purposes such as recruitment and follow-up, we did not present an itemized list of the exact purposes used. Future studies are needed to determine the usage rates of individual purposes and to determine if the use of these methods in clinical trials differs before, during, and after the pandemic.",

Although our study demonstrates significant findings regarding virtualization among ongoing COVID-19 CTs compared to discontinued trials, the pandemic and subsequent public safety measures continue to be a major contributor to halted trials globally. [8] Therefore, we encourage the incorporation of virtual methods into clinical trial conduct during the current pandemic and beyond. Future works are needed to document the challenges of implementing virtual methods into clinical trials of various types, the strategies used to overcome said challenges, and the use of virtual methods in clinical trials persisting after the COVID-19 pandemic.",
