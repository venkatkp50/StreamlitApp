            "text": "Birth-death stochastic processes are the foundations of many phylogenetic models and are widely used to make inferences about epidemiological and macroevolutionary dynamics. There are a large number of birth-death model variants that have been developed; these impose different assumptions about the temporal dynamics of the parameters and about the sampling process. As each of these variants was individually derived, it has been difficult to understand the relationships between them as well as their precise biological and mathematical assumptions. Without a common mathematical foundation, deriving new models is nontrivial. Here, we unify these models into a single framework, prove that many previously developed epidemiological and macroevolutionary models are all special cases of a more general model, and illustrate the connections between these variants. This unification includes both models where the process is the same for all lineages and those in which it varies across types. We also outline a straightforward procedure for deriving likelihood functions for arbitrarily complex birth-death(-sampling) models that will hopefully allow researchers to explore a wider array of scenarios than was previously possible. By rederiving existing single-type birth-death sampling models, we clarify and synthesize the range of explicit and implicit assumptions made by these models.

This insight has inspired a huge effort to extract information about these processes by fitting stochastic models. For example, in molecular epidemiology, researchers have leveraged the fact that for many viral pathogens, such as HIV and SARS-CoV-2, accumulate genetic diversity on the timescale of transmission (Drummond et al. 2003; Duffy et al. 2008) . This genetic diversity can be used to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships between viral variants sampled from different hosts, which in turn can help elucidate the epidemiological dynamics of a pathogen over time (Grenfell et al. 2004; Volz 2012) . Similarly, phylogenetic trees can provide unique insights into the temporal variation in speciation and extinction rates (Morlon 2014) .",

            "text": "Phylogenetic branching models can be broadly grouped into two classes. The first, based on Kingman's coalescent process (Kingman 1982) , has been widely used to examine changes in the historical population size of pathogens (Pybus et al. 2000; Strimmer and Pybus 2001; Drummond et al. 2005; Volz et al. 2009 ). These coalescent methods have also been applied to reconstruct macroevolutionary dynamics (Morlon et al. 2010) . Coalescent models are well suited for estimating deterministic population dynamics; however, fitting highly stochastic processes, such as the dynamics of an emerging pathogen, is computationally intensive and in some cases the assumptions of the coalescent may not be appropriate Boskova et al. 2014 ; Volz and Frost 2014) . The second class of models, which are collectively referred to as birth-death-sampling (BDS) models (Kendall 1948; Maddison et al. 2007; Stadler 2009; Stadler 2010) , is well suited for stochastic scenarios, and are thus becoming an increasingly favorable and popular alternative to coalescent models in epidemiology and have long been the foundation of most macroevolutionary studies-both for inferring speciation and extinction dynamics (Raup 1985; Nee et al. 1994 ) and for estimating divergence times (Gernhard 2008; Heath et al. 2014) . As the name implies, the BDS process includes three types of events: birth (pathogen transmission between hosts, or speciation in a macroevolutionary context), death (host death or recovery, or extinction in macroevolution), and sampling (including fossil collection in macroevolution).",

If we reparameterize these models, we can describe the dynamics of the basic and effective reproductive ratios (R 0 and R e , respectively) over time ) (see Box 1). A common research aim is to describe how the frequency of birth, death, and sampling events, and other derived variables such as R e , change throughout the course of an epidemic. There has been less work in macroevolution linking the parameters of a BDS model to those of an underlying more mechanistic 172 (gray) lines and classes represent rates and variables followed (in)directly by the BDS model. The SIR model can be used to constrain the rates of the BDS model (a). Simulated forward in time, the result of the BDS stochastic processes is a full tree (b) giving the complete genealogy of the viral population. Pruning away extinct and unsampled lineages produces the sampled tree (c). Arising from a BDS process, this sampled tree can be summarized in two ways. First by the set of edges (labeled 1-11) or as a set of critical times (horizontal lines) including: 1) the time of birth events (solid, x i ) 2) terminal sampling times (dashed, y j ), and 3) ancestral sampling times (dotted, z k ). Given the inferred rates from a reconstructed sampled tree, these rates can be used to estimate characteristic parameters of the SIR model, for example, the basic or effective reproductive number.",

            "text": "The BDS model follows the number of sampled and unsampled viral lineages over time, analogous to the I and I * classes of the SIR model. A key element of general BDS model is that birth and death rates may vary over time. This time dependence may VOL. 71 be either continuous (Morlon et al. 2011; Rabosky and Lovette 2008b) or discrete (Stadler 2011; Gavryushkina et al. 2014; K\u00fchnert et al. 2014) Although arbitrarily timedependent, the birth, death, and sampling rates in the general BDS model are assumed to be diversityindependent, analogous to the assumption of density-dependent transmission (pseudo mass action) in the SIR model (Keeling and Rohani 2008) . Incorporating such diversity dependence into macroevolutionary models has been shown to increase the accuracy of extinction rate estimates and are necessary to accurately capture the saturation of diversity . While some forms of diversity-dependence in diversification rates may be incorporated implicitly capturing deterministic diversity dependence as time dependence (Rabosky and Lovette 2008a) , stochastic diversity-dependence (Etienne and Rosindell 2012) goes beyond the scope of the BDS models considered here. The single-type BDS model assumes all viral lineages are exchangeable-this has several implications. First, all viral lineages are epidemiologically identical hence all mutations between them are neutral. Incorporating nonneutral genetic variation requires a multitype approach as in Equation (16). Second, transmission is independent of lineage age. In the macroevolutionary case, such age-dependence has been suggested to reflect niche differentiation in novel species (Hagen et al. 2015) and in the epidemiological case may reflect adaptation towards increased transmissibility following a host species-jumping event. Third, lineage exchangeability is reflected in the absence of an exposed (E) class in the SIR model in which hosts can, for example, transmit infections but not be sampled or vice versa. Finally, the single-type BDS model assumes all lineages are sampled at random and does not include submodels with nonrandom representation of lineages .",

The connection between the BDS process and SIR epidemiological models can also be used after the diversification rates are inferred to estimate the basic and effective reproductive rates . Specifically, the effective reproductive rate at time before the present day is given by R e () = () ()+r() () . Although the SIR model is a useful epidemiological model for is simplicity, realistically modeling epidemic dynamics requires far more complex compartmental models. As reflected by their shared structure, the application of the single-type BDS model is restricted, however, to the assumptions of the SIR model alone and further methodological advances in multitype modeling are necessary for direct inference for the larger class of epidemiological models. model (but see Ezard et al. 2016 ) but this seems like a promising avenue for future development. As we detail below and in the Supplementary material available at Dryad at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5028470, there has been an astounding rise in the variety and complexity of BDS model variants. A key assumption in the specification of BDS submodels is whether all lineages alive at some time point are exchangeable (Stadler 2013 ) (such models are hereafter \"single-type\" models), meaning they diversify according to the same process, or if rather the diversification process is variable (\"multitype\" models; e.g., Maddison et al. 2007; FitzJohn 2012; Rasmussen and Stadler 2019; Barido-Sottani et al. 2018) , with lineages belonging to one of multiple possible states each characterized by a unique process. Each of these diversification processes can then be characterized by different dynamical assumptions. In the epidemiological case, these assumptions specify, for example, the nature of viral transmission and the sampling procedure K\u00fchnert et al. 2014; Gavryushkina et al. 2014 ). While typically not explicitly tied to mechanistic evolutionary processes, there are a similar abundance of dynamical assumptions employed in the macroevolutionary context specifying the nature of biodiversity change through time (Nee 2006; Gernhard 2008; Morlon et al. 2011; Stadler 2011; Morlon 2014; Heath et al. 2014; Louca 2020) .",

However, this diversity of models has made it difficult to trace the connections between variants and to understand the precise epidemiological, evolutionary, and sampling processes that differ between them. Furthermore, despite their apparent similarities, these models have been derived on a case-by-case basis using different notation and techniques; this creates a substantial barrier for researchers working to develop novel models for new situations. And critically, it is imperative that we understand the general properties of BDS phylogenetic models and the limits of inferences from them (Louca and Pennell 2020a; Louca et al. 2021) , and this is difficult to do without considering the full breadth of possible scenarios. Here, we address all of these challenges by unifying the whole class of phylogenetic BDS models. We do so by first deriving a likelihood for general single-and multitype BDS models; in the general case, we do not assume anything about the functional forms (i.e., temporal dynamics) of the various parameters including the sampling rate through time, the possibility of sampling ancestors (or not), or how the process was conditioned. While such general models may be useful for studying the mathematical properties of BDS models as a whole (Lambert and Stadler 2013; Louca and Pennell 2020a; Louca et al. 2021) , statistical inference from these models requires researchers to make further constraints on the process. We prove that existing BDS model variants are indeed submodels of the more general case-and thereby clarify the specific assumptions made by different models-and provide a standardized notation and technique for deriving these and other submodels that have not previously been considered in the literature.",

We make the common assumption that lineages in the viral phylogeny coalesce exactly at transmission events, thus ignoring the within-host coalescent processes in the donor (Romero-Severson et al. 2016) . Throughout, we will use as a a general time variable and t \u00d7 to denote the time at which a specific event \u00d7 occurs as measured in units of time before the present day (see Supplementary Table S1 ). Lineage extinction, resulting from host recovery or death in the epidemiological case or the death of all individuals in a population in the macroevolutionary case, occurs at time-dependent rate (). We allow for two distinct types of sampling: lineages are either sampled according to a Poisson process through time () or binomially at very short intervals, which we term \"concerted sampling attempts\" (CSAs), where lineages at some specified time t l are sampled with probability l ( denotes a vector of concerted sampling events at different time points). In macroevolutionary studies based only on extant lineages, there is no Poissonian sampling, but a CSA at the present ( 0 > 0). In epidemiology, CSAs correspond to large-scale testing efforts (relative to the background rate of testing) in a short amount of time (relative to the rates of viral sequence divergence); for full explanation, see Appendix. We call these attempts rather than events because if is small or the infection is rare in the population, few or no samples may be obtained. CSAs can also be incorporated into the model by including infinitesimally short spikes in the sampling rate (more precisely, appropriately scaled Dirac distributions). Hence, for simplicity, in the main text we focus on the seemingly simpler case of pure Poissonian sampling through time except at the presentday, where we allow for a CSA to facilitate comparisons with macroevolutionary models; the resulting formulas can then be used to derive a likelihood formula for the case where past CSAs are included (see Appendix).",

Similarly, in the case of past CSAs, we must include the probability, r l , that sampled hosts are removed from the infectious pool during the CSA at time t l .

With respect to the BDS process there are two ways to represent the information contained in the phylogeny T , both of which have been used in the literature, which we call the \"edge\" and \"critical time\" representations, respectively. We begin by deriving the likelihood in terms of the edge representation and later demonstrate how to reformulate the likelihood in terms of critical times. In the edge representation, the phylogeny is summarized as a set of edges in the mathematical graph that makes up the phylogeny, numbered 1-11 in Figure B .1c, and the types of events that occurred at each node. We define g e () as the probability that the edge e which begins at time s e and ends at time t e gives rise to the subsequently observed phylogeny between time , (s e << t e ) and the present day. The likelihood of the model for the observed tree is then, is by definition g stem (T): the probability density that the stem lineage (stem = 1 in Figure B .1c) gives rise to the observed phylogeny from the origin, T, to the present day. We find that it is more intuitive to derive the likelihood in terms of the edge representation, as we show below; from this it is straightforward to derive the critical times formulation which results in mathematical simplification.

Indeed, we can obtain the likelihood of these models by adding mathematical constraints (i.e., simplifying assumptions) to the terms in Equation (13). Our work thus not only provides a consistent notation for unifying a multitude of seemingly disparate models, it also provides a concrete and numerically straightforward recipe for computing their likelihood functions. We recognize that there are many valid approaches for deriving tree likelihoods for BDS models with share many similarities with our own (e.g., Nee et al. 1994; Maddison et al. 2007; Gernhard 2008; Morlon et al. 2011; Lambert and Stadler 2013; Lambert 2018; Laudanno et al. 2020; Louca and Pennell 2020b) and do not claim ours is superior to these; however, we have found our technique to be intuitive and flexible. We have implemented the single-type BDS likelihood in the R package castor (Louca and Doebeli 2018), including routines for maximum-likelihood fitting of BDS models with arbitrary functional forms of the parameters given a phylogeny and routines for simulating phylogenies under the general BDS models (functions fit_hbds_model_on_grid, fit_hbds_model_parametric and generate_tree_hbds). Figure 1 summarizes the simplifying assumptions that underlie common previously published BDS models; these assumptions generally fall into four categories: 1) assumptions about the functional form of birth, death, and sampling rates over time, 2) assumptions pertaining to the sampling of lineages, 3) the presence of mass-extinction events, and 4) the nature of the tree-conditioning as given by S. Here, we provide a brief overview of the type of previously invoked constraints which are consistent (or not) with our unified framework; for full details on each specific case, we refer readers to the Supplementary material. While we illustrate these constraints within the single-type context, analogous assumptions can be made within the multitype context examined in the following section.",

This is mathematically and computationally convenient since an analytical solution can easily be obtained for E(). In the epidemiological case, holding constant, however, implies that the number of susceptible hosts is effectively constant throughout the epidemic and/or that the population does not change its behavior over time; this is an unrealistic assumption given seasonal changes or changes in response to the disease itself. As such, this assumption is only really valid for small time periods or the early stages of an epidemic. This is useful for estimating the basic reproductive number, R 0 , of the SIR model (Box 1) but not for the effective reproductive number R e at later time points .",

In epidemiology, concerted sampling at the present day is likely biologically unrealistic , though in some implementations of the models, such a sampling scheme has been imposed. These concerted sampling attempts prior to the present day as well as mass extinction events can be incorporated via the inclusion of Dirac distributions in the sampling and death rates, respectively. Finally, previous models often multiply the likelihood by a factor S in order to condition on a particular observation (e.g., observing at least one lineage or exactly N 0 lineages), enumerate indistinguishable trees (e.g., accounting for possible orientations or unlabeled trees) ( FIGURE 1 .

This fossilized-birth-death process has been used to estimate divergence times and to model lineage diversification (Gavryushkina et al. 2017; Landis et al. 2021) . Variants of the fossilized-birth-death process, for example including mass extinction events, are feasible and can VOL. 71 be derived using our approach. We also note that models similar to the time-variable fossilized-birthdeath process have been developed for cases when phylogenetic data is not available (i.e., when only including fossil occurrence data; see Silvestro et al. 2014; Lehtonen et al. 2017 ); we have not investigated how these models relate to our generalized BDS model but we speculate that it would be possible to also bring these models into a common framework with those that we have discussed. Supplementary material demonstrates how these submodels can be re-derived by either imposing the necessary constraints on the general likelihood formula given in Equation (13) or, alternatively, by starting from the combinations of assumptions and using the five-step procedure outlined above.",

            "text": "A common extension of the single-type diversification models explored above is to consider cases where the diversification rates (,, ) and probabilities (r,) vary among lineages as a function of a categorical \"lineage type\". This lineage type can be defined in terms of specific (Maddison et al. 2007; Rasmussen and Stadler 2019) or unspecified traits (Beaulieu and O'Meara 2016) or trait combinations (FitzJohn 2012) (for reviews of these models see Morlon 2014; Ng and Smith 2014) . Representing these lineage types as colors at nodes and along branches of the tree, we first extend the singletype model above by deriving the likelihood of a fully colored tree with topology T where the states along all edges of the phylogeny are known as given by C. The resulting likelihood is an extension of the likelihood first developed by Barido-Sottani et al. (2018) , where the diversification rates and probabilities are allowed to vary arbitrarily through time. To illustrate that our derivation is indeed quite general, we follow the model developed (independently) by Magnuson-Ford and Otto (2012) and Goldberg and Igi\u0107 (2012) , where the state of lineages can change either anagenetically, with a lineage of type a mutating to a type b at rate a,b () or cladogenetically, with a lineage of type a giving rise to a daughter lineage of type b at rate a,b (). Lineages go extinct at a state-dependent rate a () and are sampled at rate a (). As in the single-type model, upon sampling lineages are removed from the population with probability r a () whereas all lineages alive at the present day are sampled with a probability a (). As discussed in depth by Goldberg and Igi\u0107 (2012) , the other discrete variations of state-dependent diversification models We use the five-step technique specified above for the single-type case to derive the probability of observing a given colored tree under a general multitype model (see Supplementary material II). We first derive the initial value problem for the probability g e,a () that an edge e of type a in the tree at time gives rise to the subsequently observed phylogeny. The edge e here refers not to an edge in the topological tree, but to a segment of the tree all of one state between birth, sampling, or mutation events. (14) Equation (16) distinguishes between multiple types of birth events as pictured in Supplementary Figure S1 . Birth events may be symmetric, with both daughter lineages inheriting the parental type. The exchangeability of the resulting daughter lineages is reflected in the indicator variable a,b which takes on value of 2 if a = b and 1 otherwise. In contrast asymmetric birth events the resulting daughter lineages differ in type due to caldogenetic change. Importantly, the differential equation for g e,a is linear and hence has a known general solution g e,a = g e,a (s e ) (s e ,). As in the single-type model (s e ,) is the probability flow (Louca and Pennell 2020b) mapping the probability g e,a from the initial state at time s e to the probability at time .",

This likelihood is a generalization of that presented by (Barido-Sottani et al., 2018 , 2020 . Maximizing Equation (16) while incrementally adding and removing changes in state along the branches of the tree can be used to identify clades with distinct diversification parameters. This method can be used, for example, to identify transmission clusters within a disease outbreak (Barido-Sottani et al. 2018 ). This likelihood is distinct from but related to post-traversal likelihood methods developed to infer state-dependent diversification rates given the known state of sampled lineages (e.g., Maddison et al. 2007; Magnuson-Ford and Otto 2012; . Specifically, these methods give the likelihood L MBDS |T ,C \u2022 where C \u2022 ={C ,C y ,C z } is the state of present-day, C , past C y , and ancestral, C z , sampled lineages. The relationship between the numerically obtained post-traversal likelihood and the closed-form fully colored likelihood (Equation (16)) is given by:",

            "text": "In this article, we have unified a broad class of BDS models that have been widely used both in epidemiology and macroevolution. And in doing so, we have also presented a standardized notation and approach that can be used both for deriving the various submodels that have previously been studied as well as novel combinations of assumptions about the model parameters. The unification of these models clarifies the connections between BDS variants, facilitates the development of new variants tailored to specific scenarios, and provides a structure for understanding how results depend on model assumptions (Kirkpatrick et al. 2002; Lafferty et al. 2015; Louca and Pennell 2020a) . And importantly, given the recent discovery of widespread nonidentifiability in birth-death processes fit to extant-only (Louca and Pennell 2020a) and serially sampled (Louca et al. 2021 ) phylogenetic data, there is a critical need to explore a much broader range of BDS models than were previously considered and the mathematical generalization presented here will be enable this. In this appendix, we demonstrate how one can obtain the likelihood of submodels with different sets of assumptions by applying constraints to the general likelihood. There are four classes of assumptions that are commonly applied in epidemiological and macroevolutionary studies. First, researchers can make assumptions about the functional form of the birth, death, and sampling rates. Here, we address two such unique assumptions: i) birth, death, and sampling rates are constant (see the Rate Assumptions section, Sections S1.1, S1.2, and S1.5 of the Supplementary material; VOL. 71 and ii) birth, death, and sampling rates are piecewiseconstant functions of time (see Piecewise-constant Rates section, Section S1.6 of the Supplementary material). The cases where birth, death, and sampling rates are defined by a stochastic or deterministic SIR model are mathematically analogous to the cases of the piecewiseconstant and general time-variable models respectively. All additional constraints imposed will depend on the exact compartmental model used and hence we will not discuss them in detail in this section. The second major class of assumptions pertains to sampling. There are four such sampling assumptions: i) sampling happens only at the present day as in a birth-death model (see No Sampling at the Present Section, Sections S1.1, S1.3, and S1.4 of the Supplementary material) or as implemented in the \"Birth Death Skyline Contemporary\" prior in the BDSKY package in BEAST2; ii) the absence of concerted present-day sampling (see Birth-Death Models section, Section S1.5 of the Supplementary material); iii) the inclusion of ancestral samples with sampled descendants (Sections S1.6 and S1.7 of the Supplementary material; and iv) concerted sampling attempts (CSA) during which all lineages are sampled with a given probability (see Concerted Sampling Attempts section, Section S1.6 of the Supplementary material). The third assumption class considers the presence of mass extinction events (see Mass Extinction section, Section S1.5 of the Supplementary material). The fourth and final major class of assumptions deal with the conditioning of the likelihood. The various conditioning schemes are explored in below and summarized in Supplementary Table S3 available on Dryad.",

The final form of conditioning used in the literature, which we will represent simply as S 8 , is the multiplication of the BDS likelihood by a constant to account for the enumeration over the possible indistinguishable representations of a given tree. The value of this constant depends on whether the tree considered is \"labeled\" and \"oriented\" (Gavryushkina et al. 2013 ) and whether, as in the derivation here, the vector of birth events, x, is (un)ordered. Inclusion of such a constant should have no effect on the maximum likelihood inference of the model parameters given a specified tree.
