The rapid response to the COVID-19 pandemic has led to the development of a wide range of serological tests suitable for evaluating SARS-CoV-2 exposure, infection or vaccination status [1] [2] [3] . Typically, these tests are approved for use by the regulatory authorities based on their performance against a panel of reference sera including positive and negative controls at either 14-or 21-days post infection [4] .",

This led to widespread adoption of these tests across NHS laboratories for testing at population level. Other studies have con rmed this test performance at 14-21 days post infection [7, 8] . Population level serological studies have also based their conclusions -vital to guide national policy -on the basis of these tests [9] without considering how time since infection in uences the performance of the test. The problem with this approach is that it does not take into account SARS-CoV-2 humoral dynamics and changes in avidity over time [10, 11] . Although serological tests with limited diagnostic range may demonstrate excellent sensitivity shortly after infection, it is unclear how they will perform with time following infection or vaccination.",

To our knowledge no other study has evaluated the sensitivity of multiple diagnostic tests in parallel on longitudinally collected serological samples. This study demonstrates that as time elapses after infection, the sensitivity of serological testing varies widely depending on the test used. Although serological tests may be demonstrated to perform well 14-21 days after infection, this initial test performance often diminishes as time passes. In order to evaluate whether or not the population maintains SARS-CoV-2 antibodies it is vital that we utilize serological tests that remain sensitive over time.",

Although there remains no single correlate of sterilizing or protective immunity following SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination, it is clear that natural infection and the presence of neutralizing spike antibodies decreases the possibility of re-infection and the severity of disease upon re-exposure to currently circulating strains [21] . Our nding that neutralizing spike antibodies remained at high titres 200 days after infection adds to our previous study on this topic [10] and provides further evidence in support of long-lasting protection against severe disease from currently circulating strains. Fitting mathematical models to the raw data of the Roche spike assay demonstrated that spike antibody titres did not decay but rather increased slightly over the duration of the study. The Roche nucleoprotein assay also maintained sensitivity for the duration of the study with a low rate of decay. Although this assay is semiquantitative, our ndings suggest that this could be used to sensitively identify those that have been vaccinated from those that have been both vaccinated and infected.

The Abbott-N assay performed poorly at this time, whereas the Roche and MSD tests maintained a high sensitivity for the 200 days of the study. Tests that perform poorly over time will lead to spurious estimates in population level seroprevalence studies and ndings from these studies should be adjusted to account for sensitivity of the test used and the time since infection. Test performance as time passes post infection should be considered before evaluating who is a candidate for booster vaccination or anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody therapy.COVID-19 Staff Testing of Antibody Responses Study ELISAEnzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay EDI assay Epitope Diagnostics, Inc.",
