            "text": "As of September 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to devastate the health and well-being of the global population. With more than 33 million confirmed cases and over a million deaths, global health organizations are still a long way from fully containing the pandemic. This pandemic has raised serious questions about the emergency preparedness of health agencies, not only in terms of treatment of an unseen disease, but also in identifying its early symptoms. In the particular case of COVID-19, several studies have indicated that chest radiography images of the infected patients show characteristic abnormalities. However, at the onset of a given pandemic, such as COVID-19, there may not be sufficient data for the affected cases to train models for their robust detection. Hence, supervised classification is ill-posed for this problem because the time spent in collecting large amounts of infected peoples' data could lead to the loss of human lives and delays in preventive interventions. Therefore, we formulate this problem within a one-class classification framework, in which the data for healthy patients is abundantly available, whereas no training data is present for the class of interest (COVID-19 in our case). To solve this problem, we present COVIDomaly, a convolutional autoencoder framework to detect unseen COVID-19 cases from the chest radiographs. We tested two settings on a publicly available dataset (COVIDx) by training the model on chest X-rays from (i) only healthy adults, and (ii) healthy and other non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and detected COVID-19 as an anomaly. After performing 3-fold cross validation, we obtain a pooled ROC-AUC of 0.7652 and 0.6902 in the two settings respectively. These results are very encouraging and pave the way towards research for ensuring emergency preparedness in future pandemics, especially the ones that could be detected from chest X-rays.",

The virus continues to spread to this day, and has been classified as a global pandemic resulting in the death of over 1 million people and 33 million infected cases. As per the WHO's 6 Phase model of pandemics (Organization et al., 2009) , by the end of 2019, COVID-19 was apparently in early Phase 3, which is commonly referred to as the \"Pandemic alert period\" and defined as, an animal or human-animal influenza reassortant virus has caused sporadic cases or small clusters of disease in people, but has not resulted in human-to-human transmission sufficient to sustain community-level outbreaks. Early detection of pandemic cases at this phase is important so that sufficient preventative steps are taken and transitioning to subsequent phases of pandemics may be contained. However, the challenge is that sufficient infected cases may not be available at this phase to make an informed decision.",

It is common knowledge in the machine learning field that large amounts of training data is required to build robust and generalizable supervised classifiers. The premise of these supervised classification studies is that sufficient cases of COVID-19 have already occurred. From a data-driven machine learning perspective, this translates to having access to more data for training better classifiers. However, it is non-compassionate and catastrophic to let millions of people get infected (and possibly die) in order to collect sufficient data to train classifiers. Furthermore, this approach does not help detect early cases of a pandemic, such as COVID-19, which is necessary to contain and prevent further loss of human life. We argue that supervised classification for detecting COVID-19 could be regarded as a good strategy only after, but not before the fact. Therefore, there is a need to postulate alternative problem formulations for detecting early cases of COVID-19 in order to prevent the spread of a virus from becoming a full scale pandemic.",

In OCC, the samples for normal class are readily available (e.g. healthy CXR) at no additional cost; however, the samples for not-normal class (COVID-19 cases) may be either unavailable, poorly sampled or too costly to collect (both in terms of dollars and human life). We formulate early detection of COVID-19 cases from CXR as a OCC problem, given the challenge in collecting infected samples data and the accompanying cost. To demonstrate the validity of our proposal, we present the COVIDomaly framework using a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) that is trained on CXR of healthy adults only, and tested on both healthy and COVID-19 CXR. Our motivation is to train a CAE that is able to detect COVID-19 cases, without ever being exposed to them during the training phase, by recognizing the COVID-19 cases as anomalous samples vis-\u00e0-vis the training data distribution. Since 'not-normal' samples are not needed in this formulation, labeling normal samples is not required and learning of the 'normal' concept can be achieved in an unsupervised manner. There exist very few papers that may have used similar setup with some CXR samples for training (refer to Section 2 for details); ours is the first proposal to detect COVID-19 cases in an entirely OCC manner with no access to these cases during the training phase. To validate the early detection of COVID-19, we experimented with the following two data-availability settings:",

Most of these works have been conducted in a supervised classification setting. As discussed in the previous section, and due to the scope of this paper, we will only discuss those studies that use either OCC or anomaly detection setup for detecting COVID-19 using CXR. propose the confidenceaware anomaly detection (CAAD) model that works by a convolutional feature detector model feeding into an anomaly detection module and a confidence prediction module that work together to classify instances of healthy control, viral-pneumonia, and nonviral pneumonia. CAAD utilizes an anomaly detection module that enables it to potentially train in the absence of viral pneumonia CXR cases. However, CAAD relies on its confidence prediction module and needs positive viral-pneumonia CXR training examples to increase its AUC from 0.8361 to 0.8747 on a test set comprising of normal cases and viral-pneumonia cases. Tuluptceva et al. (2020) propose a deep autoencoder with progressively growing blocks with residual connections to detect abnormalities in CXR images. The model utilizes the anomaly detection framework where an autoencoder learns the characteristics of \"normal\" CXR and could potentially detect out-of-distribution anomalous CXR images. The model, however, uses both normal and abnormal cases during the training. The authors use the model for the more general task of detecting abnormalities in CXR images and metastases in the lymph node. The authors achieve an ROC-AUC of 0.90 for detection of normal cases from abnormal cases (metastases) (Wong et al., 2020) . presented COVID-19 detection from CXR images as a cost-sensitive learning problem to handle high misdiagnosis cost of COVID-19 cases because of their visual similarity to other pneumonia cases.",

This goal is achieved by minimizing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the input image and the reconstructed image. During the training phase, the CAE gets to see only the normal cases, and consequently ends up learning to extract features that are good for reconstructing the normal cases. As such, the CAE is expected to produce a low reconstruction error for normal samples in the test set, while giving higher reconstruction error for the out-ofdistribution or anomalous samples.

We calculated AUC using two methods. Firstly, we calculated AUC for each fold and reported the mean (AU C \u00b5 ) and standard deviation (AU C \u03c3 ) across 3folds.

These results suggest that COVID-19 can be detected as an anomaly when the CAE autoencoder is trained only on healthy CXR images without seeing COVID-19 cases during training. However, when the normal class comprises of both healthy and non-COVID-19 pneumonia CXRs, the performance of COVIDomaly deteriorates. This could be due to the fact that COVID-19 pneumonia CXRs may have high resemblance with non-COVID-19 pneumonia CXRs in terms of radiographic appearances of multifocal ground glass opacities, linear opacities, and consolidation (Cleverley et al., 2020) . In the COVID-Net paper (Wang and Wong, 2020) , the authors reported high accuracy for classification between COVID-19 and other pneumonia CXRs in a supervised setting. There appear to be two potential problems with the claim. Firstly, it goes against the common clinical understanding that both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 pneumonia can have similar features. Secondly, their test sample size is very small. Moreover, it is not clear as to how they chose that convenience sample, and why more rigorous evaluation techniques (e.g. cross validation) were not utilized in Wang and Wong (2020) .",

For setting (iii), we obtained AU C \u00b5 = 0.6781 and AU C \u03c3 = 0.0184, and AU C p = 0.6778, which is very similar in performance to setting (ii). This shows that COVIDomaly is still able to detect COVID-19 cases with fairly good confidence even with only seeing non-COVID-19 pneumonia CXR during training the model. To visually understand the input CXR and its reconstruction during testing phase for both the normal and COVID-19 cases for setting (i), we present examples corresponding to 5 lowest reconstruction errors for normal CXR images ( Figure 2 ) and COVID-19 example cases corresponding to top 5 reconstruction errors ( Figure 3 ). As can be seen in the case of normal CXRs in Figure 2 , the reconstructed images appear very similar to the input CXR, albeit a bit hazywhich is an after effect of using the MSE loss. However, as seen in Figure 3 , in the case of COVID-19, the reconstructed CXRs appear more distorted. This indicates that COVIDOmaly could not reconstruct these CXRs properly, and therefore they were detected as anomalies. Although there may be some cases of badly reconstructed normal images and COVID-19 CXR images with low reconstruction error, these two figures provide an insight into the reason for superior performance in setting (i).

Another direction of research is exploring a combination of multiple loss functions, such as gradient loss and intensity loss that have shown good performance in other domains. This architecture may further benefit by making use of different image-to-image transformation networks such as the U-Net Long et al. (2015) . Moreover, currently we have presented separate results from individual anomaly detectors by considering various definitions of \"normal\" class (i.e. healthy alone, healthy plus non-COVID pneumonia, and non-COVID pneumonia alone); in the future we plan to develop fusion strategies to combine the outputs of individual anomaly detectors trained on CXRs from various non-COVID conditions for which data is available abundantly in pre-pandemic times.
