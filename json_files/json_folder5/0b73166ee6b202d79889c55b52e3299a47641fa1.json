            "text": "In a world with an increasing population at risk of exposure to arthropod-borne flaviviruses, access to timely and accurate diagnostic tests would impact profoundly on the management of cases. Twenty peptides previously identified using a flavivirus proteome-wide microarray were evaluated to determine their discriminatory potential to detect dengue virus (DENV) infection. This included nine peptides recognized by IgM antibodies (PM peptides) and 11 peptides recognized by IgG antibodies (PG peptides). A bead-based multiplex peptide immunoassay (MPIA) using the Luminex technology was set-up to determine Ab binding levels to each of these peptides in a panel of 323 carefully selected human serum samples. Sera are derived from individuals either infected with different viruses, namely, the four DENV serotypes, Zika virus (ZIKV), yellow fever virus (YFV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), West Nile virus (WNV) and Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or receiving vaccination against YFV, tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Additionally, a set of healthy controls were included. We targeted a minimum specificity of 80% for all the analysis. The PG-9 peptide had the best sensitivity (73%) when testing DENV sera from acute patients (A-DENV; <8 days since symptom onset). With sera from convalescent DENV patients (C-DENV; >10 days since symptom onset) the FPG-1 peptide was the best seromarker with a sensitivity of 86%. When combining all A-DENV and C-DENV samples, peptides PM-22 and FPG-1 had the best-diagnostic performance with a sensitivity of 60 and 61.1%, and areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.7865 and 0.8131, respectively. A Random forest (RF) algorithm was used to select the best combination of peptides to classify DENV infection at a targeted specificity >80%. The best RF model for PM peptides that included A-DENV and C-DENV samples, reached a sensitivity of 72.3%, while for PG peptides, the best RF models for A-DENV only, C-DENV only and A-DENV + C-DENV reached a sensitivity of 88.9%, 89.1%, and 88.3%, respectively. In conclusion, the combination of multiple peptides constitutes a founding set of seromarkers for the discrimination of DENV infected individuals from other flavivirus infections.",

These numbers however, do not reflect the actual burden of the dengue virus (DENV), because in 2013 a report estimated that the number of dengue infections could reach 390 million annually worldwide (2) . The difficulties to spot-on true dengue numbers are mainly attributed to the failure in the surveillance systems unable to capture cases that do not seek healthcare (under-ascertainment); and to report cases that do seek healthcare (underreporting). Among the underreported infections, the under-diagnosis is of specific concern in resourcelimited setting (RLS) where insufficient testing, poor deployment of diagnostic tools, and misdiagnosis with other febrile infectious diseases take place. In the Americas in 2020, the vast majority of the North American dengue cases reported to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) were lab confirmed, whereas in the Andean sub-region only 25% of the reported dengue cases were confirmed by a lab test (3) .",

Serological tests on the other hand are more suitable for identifying infected individuals in RLS and tackle the problem of the narrow diagnostic window because anti-DENV antibodies (Abs) remain in the serum for much longer periods. The main concern with Ab-based detection techniques is cross-reactivity by Abs towards antigens (Ags) of other antigenically related flaviviruses, of which proteins can share approximately 60% or higher amino acid sequence identity (4) . The detrimental implications of cross-reactivity on the accuracy of the serological tests leads to false-positive test results (5, 6) .",

These results suggest that this peptide could be useful for the differentiation of primary from secondary infection, under the assumption that the rapid rise of IgG titers against PG-40 detected in A-DENV samples from endemic patients corresponded with an anamnestic response from a previous DENV infection. Unfortunately, no documented history of previous DENV infection is available for these samples. PG-40 peptide could also be of special interest as a biomarker for serostatus determination, given that a positive test confirming prior DENV infection is crucial to guide vaccination with Dengvaxia (11) . According to a recent review, the current available DENV RDTs are highly specific (100%), but the sensitivity is lower than 41% for the detection of prior infection in endemic samples (12) .",

For this purpose, the specificity was prioritized over sensitivity given the impact that specificity has on flavivirus diagnosis. These findings revealed that the combination of six different peptides for RFM and RFG models showed an improvement in the sensitivity compared to the observed sensitivity when single peptides were evaluated. Despite that specificity was targeted at minimally 80%, this constitutes a clear progress in respect to the performance of currently available commercial tests for DENV serology.",

Boxplots represent the comparison of the measured Ab response (MFI levels) in DENV positive samples against the detailed peptides between (A) endemic and non-endemic samples, (B) acute and early convalescent samples, and between early and late convalescent samples, and (C) hospitalized versus non-hospitalized samples. Positive DENV samples were confirmed by RT-PCR and/or IgM/IgG seroconversion. Horizontal box boundaries and midline denote sample quartiles. The analysis was performed for all the peptides, but only those showing statistically significant differences between groups are plotted (P <.05). Supplementary Figure 2 | Heat map representing antibody levels against DENV peptides. The heatmap depicts the intensity of the IgM and IgG antibodies measured in MFI. Each column corresponds to one peptide and each row represents a sample. The color intensity indicates the measured MFI values going from low (light yellow) to high (red) levels. DENV, dengue virus; ZIKV, Zika virus; YFV, yellow fever virus; TBEV, Tick borne encephalitis virus; JEV, Japanese encephalitis virus; WNV, West Nile virus; CHIKV, chikungunya virus; HIV, Human immunodeficiency virus; NEG, healthy donors; Conva, convalescent sample. Supplementary Figure 3 | Contribution of each peptide to classification accuracy. Random forest machine learning technique ranked the contribution of each peptide to the classification accuracy using the mean decrease accuracy and the mean decrease gini index. Ranking of (A) IgM peptides, and (B) IgG peptides.",
