            "text": "Air pollution is the contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment by any chemical, physical, or biological agent that modifies the natural characteristics of the atmosphere (WHO, 2017) . A critical air pollutant is particulate matter (PM), which is measured in micrograms per cubic meter (\u03bcg/m 3 ). The major components of PM are sulfate, nitrates, ammonia, sodium chloride, black carbon, and mineral dust (Amegah and Mensah, 2017; WHO, 2017) , including the novel SARS-CoV-2 . Results have shown that SARS-CoV-2 virions have similar characteristic like other air pollutant with a determined settling velocity depending on the particulate size (see Anchordoqui & Chudnovsky, 2020) . Furthermore, the main sources of PM are household combustion devices, motor vehicles, industrial facilities, poor waste management system, forest fires (Brauer et al., 2012) , and human reflexes (sneezing and exhalation) . In the study of air quality, atmospheric aerosol, which is a mixture of solid and liquid particulate matter (PM), is also a major pollutant Abstract Air pollution is a global problem; hence, many countries devoted lots of resources towards its study and possible eradication. The major parameter indicator for air quality is the particulate matter (PM). These particles, especially PM 2.5 , are injurious to health either under high concentration levels or after a long-term exposure. PM 2.5 particles are known to cause lung and respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and even cancer. In this research, artificial neural networks were used to train PM 2.5 measurements obtained from the Surface Particulate Matter Network (SPARTAN). The training was done using inputs that indicate time series of the measurements and the prevailing atmospheric conditions. The developed models were used to estimate PM 2.5 over a sub-Saharan site in Ilorin. Our study considered meteorological parameters and aerosol optical depth (AOD) as inputs for the neural networks. The targets are PM 2.5 measurements obtained from SPARTAN. Our models showed very high correlation with measured data. Apart from the data generated using model p which has a correlation of 0.0009, the correlation R 2 for other models ranges from 0.59 to 1 3 261",

            "text": "Page 2 of 15 (Gupta et al., 2006) . Particulate matter, which is used to segregate between aerosols, is majorly discussed in air quality-related researches as either PM 2.5 (these are particle loading with a diameter of 2.5 \u03bcm or less (PM 2.5 ), ultrafine particles, and soot) or PM10 (loading of particles with a diameter less than or equal to 10 \u00b5m (\u03bcm) (PM 10 ). These particles, especially PM 2.5 , are injurious to health either under high concentration levels or after a long exposure. PM 2.5 particles are known to cause lung and respiratory diseases, premature death (Wang & Christopher, 2003) , cardiovascular diseases (Weber et al., 2010) , and even cancer (Pope et al., 2002) . Air pollution in Africa, as at today, is responsible for a high number of premature deaths (Mbewu & Mbanya, 2006; WHO, 2013) and also hinders economic development with a resultant cost of 2.7% of GDP of the continent. The report by Vidal (2016) (see www. thegu ardian. com/ global-devel opment/ 2016/ oct/ 20/ air-pollu tion-deadl ier-africa-than-dirty-wateror-malnu triti on-oecd) highlighted that polluted air kills approximately 712,000 yearly in Africa, compared to 542,000 from unsafe water, 275,000 from malnutrition, and 391,000 from unsafe sanitation. This translates to an increase of 36% in the death rate as a result of outdoor air population from 1990 to 2013 (Brauer et al., 2012) . The WHO reported that this mortality is mainly due to exposure to inhalable particulate matter, particles of 10 microns or less in diameter (PM 10 ), which cause cardiovascular and respiratory disease and cancers. The economic loss as a result of air pollution in Africa was put at $447bn in 2013 (Vidal, 2016) , which amounts to a huge economic loss compared to poverty index and average per capita income in Africa. Hence, air pollution poses more risk in Africa than malnutrition and diseases. Air pollution sources in Sub-Saharan African (SSA) can be natural or anthropogenic. Petkova et al. (2013) and Naidja et al. (2018) reported that biomass burning, poor waste management, and the high number of diesel-powered vehicles are the predominant sources of anthropogenic PM, while Saharan dust and savanna fires are the main natural sources of particulate matter. Within the sub-Saharan region, particles from the Sahara Desert and in particular the Bod\u00e9l\u00e9 depression greatly affect the PM all year round (Onyeuwaoma et al., 2015) . Therefore, there is the need to understand the role of these aerosol sources on the sub-Saharan public health. Furthermore, air pollution episodes can also be attributable to power generation, increased industrialization, burning of refuse, millions of steel diesel electricity generators, cars which have had the catalytic converters removed, petrochemical plants, the construction sector (Burciaga, 2020) , and indoor cooking with inefficient fuel stoves (Mulenga & Siziya, 2019) . In spite these aforementioned sources, knowledge of the sources of air pollution, its magnitude, and impact in much of Africa is still sketchy. In order to tackle air quality headlong, the World Health Assembly (WHA), in its Sixty-ninth assembly in 2016, proposed a more vigorous and comprehensive research on air quality to quantify and ascertain its actual health impact. To compound the issue, most Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries have no actual historical long-term air quality monitoring station (Petkova et al., 2013) . This underscores the need to use other proxy data to apportion the source and quantity of PM 2.5 emission within this region. On the other hand, Brauer et al. (2012) opined that PM 2.5 concentration in SSA stood at around 100 \u00b5g/m 3 compared to < 20 \u00b5g/m 3 in the Europe and North America. This implies that in SSA, the air quality scenario is tending towards the Asian experience. Therefore, in order to effectively tackle the problems associated with air quality, there must be a strong political commitment aimed at re-writing the narrative. This lack of will/commitment according to Amegah and Agyei-Mensah (2017) is attributable to the following reasons:",

In view of this, the established risky conditions for PM 2.5 concentration exposure starts from 40.5 \u00b5m \u22123 especially for individuals suffering from heart or lung ailments, older adults, and children (Gorai et al., 2018) . Unfortunately, most of the studies used in establishing these epidemiological evidences were conducted in Europe and North America where PM data are available, while regions prone to bad air quality like Africa have no PM data (Snider et al., 2015) nor air quality guidelines (Petkova et al., 2013) . To buttress this point, World Health Organization reported that air quality monitoring in SSA is only conducted in 9 out of the 27 countries within the region (WHO, 2013). To compound the issue, most available data are given at a price. Outside the SSA, a lot of efforts had been committed towards air quality research; for instance, Sajjadi et al. (2017) studied the concentration of PM 2.5 and PM 10 in Sabzevar, Iran, using measurements from 48 stations. Elsewhere in China, Zhang et al. (2006) and Vedal et al. (2017) showed that there have been intensive studies on how to curb air pollution and its health effects. Zhu (2017) opined that the Chinese scientific communities are already familiar with air pollution and its control since the 1970s till date, and their results are considered during policy formulation. To this effect, Lim et al. (2012) reported that the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) assessment attributed 3.2 million premature deaths per year to ambient PM 2.5 , which made PM 2.5 exposure a major cause of premature death globally. This implies that, in assessing the GDB, the volume of PM 2.5 emitted must be well integrated (Lim et al., 2012; WHO, 2014) , for environmental performance indicators (EPI, 2014) . Therefore, to understand the air quality within any given environment, it needs to be studied in relation with other local prevailing factors. This gave rise to various PM models as shown in see section \"PM measurements\".",

The Sahara Desert which is the world's largest desert, with a temperature above 37.78 \u00b0C (100 \u00b0F), is located within the SSA. Furthermore, SSA is characterized by sparse rainfall. The locations for this study are Ilorin in Nigeria located at latitude 8.484, longitude 4.675. This location had at some point a PM monitoring and meteorological stations operated by Surface PARTiculate mAtter Network (SPARTAN) instrument. The data from this station will be used as the base data (Snider et al., 2015) for integration into the models. Studies carried out in Ouagadougu, Burkina Faso (Boman et al., 2009) , eastern Botswana (Chimidza & Moloi 2000) , and Dar es Salaam (Tanzania) show that soil dust is the major component of particulate matter in most parts of SSA.

These parameters were substituted interchangeable to create different models. Previous researches observed that at high RH (Wang & Christopher, 2003) , the hygroscopic effect sets in thereby changing the size distribution and the scattering efficiencies of particles (Wang & Martin, 2007) . Conversely, Gupta and Christopher (2009) reported that high temperatures enhance the photochemical reactions which in turn lead to increased production of PM 2.5 particles in the atmosphere, which implies that temperature is a very important factor to be considered in PM estimation. Furthermore, pressure was included in the analysis to establish its relationship with particulate matter concentration. \u2022 Total particle light scattering (B) was used in place of aerosol optical depth (AOD) data because of its availability within the temporal scale. Hence, the available AOD data had a lot of missing days. Furthermore, B gives information on the aerosol loading within the environment (see Eq. 4).",

Figure 6 shows the plots of modelled (from B, FB and P) and measured data. The B plot shows the modeling of PM from total particle light scattering (B) only. The result from this plot indicates that B can predict PM 2.5 with an R 2 of 0.956 (see scatter plot) and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 2.73 \u00b5 m \u22123 . It was further observed that there was a slight over prediction of PM by the model when the PM reading is below 10 \u00b5 m \u22123 . In general, B shows a very high predictability of PM. The plot FB shows that at some points, the model over predicts (as indicated by the spikes) PM 2.5 both at high and low PM concentration, which resulted in a correlation of 0.612 and a RMSE of 8.11 \u00b5 m \u22123 (see Table 1 ). Between the measured and modelled data, the plots indicate a moderate predictability of PM from FB. Furthermore, when P alone was used as the predictor variable, the result shows an over estimation of Fig. 6 Model results in comparison with measured data, when B, FB, and P were used in the neural network prediction. The red lines show the modelled data while blue lines show the measured data alongside the scatter plot PM in all concentration scenario. The correlation of P model stood at 0.000951 and RMSE of 13 \u00b5 m \u22123 which does not in any way replicate the measured data. This indicates that P alone cannot be used to determine air quality situation. Figure 7 on the other hand shows the estimation of PM from PRB, PB, and PFB, respectively. The predictive model from PRB shows a near perfect fitting of both measured and predicated data with a correlation of 0.741 and RMSE of 6.62 \u00b5 m \u22123 . This implies that a combination of these meteorological parameters can effectively predict PM during low and high episodes. Also, PB on the other hand shows a high PM predictability with an R square of 0.639 and 7.81 \u00b5 m \u22123 RMSE. A combination of PB that was observed slightly over predicts PM especially when the value is below 10 \u00b5 m \u22123 . For PFB, the results indicate an under estimation of low PM as seen by the spikes pointing downwards. Subsequently, when the measured values are above 10 \u00b5 m \u22123 , there is a fair representation from this model. The correlation and RMSE for this model stood at 0.596 and 8.27, respectively.",

With the combination of PTRB, the result showed a correlation of 0.838 and an RMSE of 5.24. This model over predicts PM when the values are above 10 \u00b5 m \u22123 . Using PTFB as a predictor combination gave an average prediction value at an R square of 0.64 and an RMSE of 7.78 \u00b5 m \u22123 . The curve further showed that all the predicted values fall within the measured range, but slightly over predicts PM when it falls below 10 \u00b5 m \u22123 . In Fig. 9 , we showed the results obtained from models TRB, TB, and TFB. The plot TRB showed similar results obtained in Figs. 6 and 8 (see B) but an R squared of 0.84 and RMSE of 5.13 \u00b5 m \u22123 . The difference between models TRB and B is that low PM values cannot be easily obtained from B. Furthermore, the model TB over predicted low ranged values but does better when the PM values are relatively high with an R square of 0.93 and RMSE of 3.26 \u00b5 m \u22123 showing similar results like in B. A comparison of B and TB showed that the influence of temperature in the model is limited when other meteorological parameters are removed (see Fig. 6 ). Meanwhile, TFB showed an incoherent prediction pattern, where the predicted and measured values do not match. In most cases, low measured value corresponds to the peak modelled values though the R squared and RMSE are 0.71 and 7.01, respectively.",

P alone on the other hand as a sole predictor does not have a definite pattern. Subsequently, PFB and PRB on the other hand predict both high and low scenarios effectively. The introduction of the parameters R and F in the models determines the direction of the predicted values. When F is introduced, the model will under predict low PM events while R captures low events more accurately. This implies that to capture low emission events, R must be put into consideration in the model. When the temperature component was considered in the model (PTRB, PTFB, TRB, TB, TFB), it resulted thus; for TB, the measured PM was well predicted when the value is above 10 \u00b5 m \u22123 , while lower values were over predicted. Meanwhile, on addition of R, it was able to stabilize the model by capturing values lower than 10 \u00b5 m \u22123 effectively. Further to this, the substitution of R with F was able to predict PM greater than 10 \u00b5 m \u22123 , while under predicting lower values. It was also observed that when the T component was added to PRB, it counters the effect of effect of R given rise to the same result as was observed in RB (see Fig. 9 ). Similarly, T has the same effect when added to PFB; hence, the model over predicts PM values less than 10 \u00b5 m \u22123 . These results further showed that temperature (T) as a meteorology factor in PM prediction counteracts the effect of relative humidity in the models contrary to the submission by Gupta and Christopher (2009) .",

This implies that there is a strong relationship between low PM and parameters P, R, and F. Consequently, in order to predict PM above 10 \u00b5 m \u22123 , B can be used independently, but for a holistic prediction, the combination of PRB is most appropriate. Figure 10 is the result of covariance analysis of the measured and modelled PM 2.5, which shows that only three models (p, b, and tb) had varied mean from the measured data.

The results obtained were compared with measured data to ascertain the performance of the individual models against the measured data.

Subsequently, model P showed no resemblance with the measured data at a correlation of 0.0009. Generally, the results from models showed that air quality can be inferred from meteorology in areas where there is dearth of PM data. These models can be used to estimate PM 2.5 and extrapolate in other environments that lack PM data. Therefore, in this research, we have succeeded in developing models from meteorological parameters for determining air quality (PM 2.5) in sub-Saharan Africa. The choice of the model(s) by an individual user depends on the data available at the disposal of the user, while taking into consideration the established accuracy of level of the chosen model. Finally, further work is ongoing to determine and spatially characterize the variation of aerosol loading in sub-Saharan Africa from 1998 to 2020.",
