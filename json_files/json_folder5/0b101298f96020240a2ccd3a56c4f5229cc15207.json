Imaging procedures are also useful for detecting the damage caused by COVID-19. Chest X-ray imaging is frequently used to diagnose COVID-19 and different pneumonias. This paper presents a task-specific framework to detect coronavirus in X-ray images. Binary classification of three different labels (healthy, bacterial pneumonia, and COVID-19) was performed on two differentiated data sets in which corona is stated as positive. First-order statistics, gray level co-occurrence matrix, gray level run length matrix, and gray level size zone matrix were analyzed to form fifteen sub-data sets and to ascertain the necessary radiomics. Two normalization methods are compared to make the data meaningful. Furthermore, five feature ranking approaches (Bhattacharyya, entropy, Roc, t-test, and Wilcoxon) are mentioned to provide necessary information to a state-of-the-art classifier based on Gauss-map-based chaotic particle swarm optimization and neural networks. The proposed framework was designed according to the analyses about radiomics, normalization approaches, and filter-based feature ranking methods. In experiments, seven metrics were evaluated to objectively determine the results: accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, sensitivity, specificity, g-mean, precision, and f-measure. The proposed framework showed promising scores on two X-ray-based data sets, especially with the accuracy and area under the ROC curve rates exceeding 99% for the classification of coronavirus vs. others. .tr (M.

            "text": "Here, we propose a task-specific framework for detecting coronavirus in X-ray images. For this purpose, framework analyses were performed by using four radiomics, two normalization approaches, five filter-based feature selection methods and an efficient optimized classifier. The optimized classifier is kept constant at the end of the framework. These analyses were examined in detail to design the remaining parts of the framework and to realize the highest classification performance that the framework was capable of. selected with social mimic optimization (SMO) and classified by the SVM-based model. The proposed model achieved 99.27% accuracy for multiclass classification. Ucar and Korkmaz [8] designed a diagnosis model employing Deep Bayes-SqueezeNet to categorize coronavirus in X-ray images. The data set used by them contained X-ray images belonging to three categories (1583 normal, 4290 pneumonia and 76 , and the data were augmented to obtain higher performance. After augmentation, the proposed model achieved an overall accuracy of 98.26% for multiclass classification. Apostolopoulos and Mpesiana [9] compared deep learning methods by considering two Xray-based data sets: one consisting of 224 COVID-19, 700 bacterial pneumonia, and 504 normal images and the other comprising 224 COVID-19, 714 bacterial and viral, and 504 normal cases. Pretrained models such as VGG19, MobileNet-v2, and Inception-ResNet-v2 were implemented for binary and multiclass classification, and the best accuracy rate (96.78%) was recorded for binary classification with MobileNet-v2. Butt et al. [10] constructed a CT image data set comprising 184 COVID- 19, 194 influenza-A viral pneumonia, and 145 healthy cases. They proposed a model employing a three-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural network (CNN) and used it to segment and identify the candidate region. The model achieved an area under the ROC (which stands for ''receiver operating characteristic'') curve (AUC) score of 99.6% for coronavirus vs. noncoronavirus classification. Li et al. [11] used 4356 CT images to train a 3D deep learning model named COVNet. The collected data set was divided into two classes: COVID-19 and others. In experiments, COVNet achieved an AUC score of 96% for the detection of coronavirus. Kang et al. [12] used 2522 CT images containing 1495 COVID-19 and 1027 pneumonia cases, and employed the V-Net model was handled to obtain the lung, lung lobes, and pulmonary segments. The lesion region was subsequently segmented. Radiomic and handcrafted features were extracted from each CT image, and five classifiers were used to categorize them. The best classification accuracy (95.5%) was achieved by a neural network (NN) algorithm. Afshar et al. [13] used a model processing capsule network (CN) to classify X-ray images belonging to four types of classes (individuals with COVID-19, those with a viral disease, those with a bacterial disease, and normal individuals). The study focused on coronavirus vs. noncoronavirus classification to detect COVID-19. The CN-based structure achieved 95.7% accuracy. Subsequently, the application of a transfer learning method to the CN increased the accuracy up to 98.3%. Mahdy et al. [14] performed binary classification on Xray images comprising 15 normal and 25 COVID-19 cases. The study first performed multilevel thresholding on images, and the thresholding results were classified into two categories (COVID-19 and normal) with an SVM. Experiments showed that the suggested pipeline achieved 97.48% accuracy for binary classification. Hemdan et al. [15] used different deep learning methods to classify 25 COVID-19 and 25 normal cases in an X-ray data set. The best classification accuracy (90%) was obtained by the VGG19 and DenseNet201 algorithms. Table 1 presents a review of state-of-the-art methods.",

Gauss-map-based CPSO (GM-CPSO) achieved remarkable convergence against state-ofthe-art methods for global function optimization. To test the efficiency of GM-CPSO, Koyuncu hybridized it with a NN, and designing a hybrid classifier was considered as the second task. GM-CPSO-NN was compared with recent and efficient hybrid classifiers for epileptic seizure recognition. In the data set, five categories (tumor area, nontumor area, closed-eye, and open-eye recordings with no seizure activity, and seizure activity) were considered, and the seizure vs. nonseizure discrimination was performed with the highest accuracy (97.24%) by GM-CPSO-NN. In another study of Koyuncu [29] , GM-CPSO-NN was compared with robust hybrid NNs and with the derivatives of [27] used GM-CPSO-NN as the classifier unit to design a taskaffirmative framework for brain tumor classification. Two optimized classifiers were compared with GM-CPSO-NN to identify the classifier that was appropriate for the construction of the framework. According to the results, the framework containing GM-CPSO-NN had the highest accuracy score (90.18%) for the binary characterization of brain tumors.",

The width of the matrix is dependent on the zone sizes/surfaces. If the texture homogeneity increases, the zones increase in size and the matrix width increases. Therefore, the result matrix becomes wider. When the texture contains considerable noise, so single pixel zones, the number of zones is large, sometimes with close gray level values, which appear in a part of the matrix. By contrast, when the texture is homogeneous, as there are less zones, the matrix contains more zeros and is flattened. The GLSZM computes one matrix for all directions, unlike the GLCM and GLRLM approaches. In this study, 12 efficient features were considered for the GLSZM: small zone emphasis (SZE), large zone emphasis (LZE), gray level nonuniformity (GLNz), zone size nonuniformity (ZSN), zone percentage (ZP), low gray level zone emphasis (LGZE), high gray level zone emphasis (HGZE), small zone low gray level emphasis (SZLGE), small zone high gray level emphasis (SZHGE), large zone low gray level emphasis (LZLGE), large zone high gray level emphasis (LZHGE), and gray level variance (GLV).

The velocity ranges of the weight-bias values were maintained at 0.2 times the position ranges for achieving higher performance [27] [28] [29] . Four parameters (acceleration constants, hidden node number, population size, and maximum iteration number) were varied to observe the highest scores in trials by using seven metric-based comparisons. The necessary feature combination, reliable normalization, and appropriate feature ranking were determined by calculating the number of best scores on the seven metrics. Tables 4 and 5 show the performance comparison of feature combinations (radiomics evaluation) to which minmax and z-score approaches were applied. In the absence of the application of a feature ranking method, the first comparison (Tables 4 and 5 ) is related to the identification of effective radiomics. Subsequently, normalization analyses were performed. Table 4 shows that the best success rates of five metrics (accuracy, AUC, sensitivity, f-measure, and g-mean) were achieved by using FOS and FOS + GLRLM features, and the scores are identical for the two features. If the accuracy and AUC metrics are scrutinized, five features (FOS, FOS + GLCM, FOS + GLRLM, FOS + GLCM + GLRLM, and FOS + GLRLM + GLSZM) are observed to yield success scores over 97% for data #1. The key point of the analyses is FOS features, and the addition of other features (except GLRLM) cannot provide higher performance. Even if the combination FOS + GLRLM reveals the same results and cannot enhance the performance, it can also be considered as an appropriate preference. Table 5 shows that the highest scores of five metrics (accuracy, AUC, sensitivity, f-measure, and g-mean) were observed for FOS + GLRLM + GLSZM features. Scores above 97% for the accuracy and AUC metrics were attained in only three conditions (FOS, FOS + GLRLM, and FOS + GLRLM + GLSZM). Although the choice of FOS + GLRLM provides a score above 97% for the accuracy and AUC metrics, it decreases the performance on six metrics according to the rates with FOS features. FOS + GLRLM + GLSZM features are superior in terms of attaining remarkable scores. Moreover, it can be inferred that some additions (GLRLM with FOS features) can decrease the performance while some combinations (FOS + GLRLM + GLSZM) can offer higher performance despite adding new features (GLSZM) to a performance-reducing preference (FOS +GLRLM). Fig. 4 presents a summary of the best results assessed by using the minmax and z-score approaches for the FOS, FOS + GLRLM, and FOS + GLRLM + GLSZM features. The best results were obtained on six metrics by applying z-score to FOS + GLRLM + GLSZM features. Although zscore-based results are higher than minmax-based scores, the rates are very close.",

It involves FOS or FOS + GLRLM features as the radiomic features, minmax as the normalization approach, Bhattacharyya or Roc rankings as the feature selection method, and GM-CPSO-NN as the classifier unit. As declared before, data #1 has a normal distribution while data #2 is specified as an imbalanced data set. At this juncture, the classification performance for data #1 is expected to be higher than the results for data #2 since the detection of coronavirus patterns of data #2 is more challenging owing to the smaller number of samples for the COVID-19 label. However, our framework achieved significant scores for data #1, especially for the accuracy (99.17%) and AUC (99.06%) metrics. It also showed better performance for data #2 by presenting success scores of 99.25% and 99.53% for the accuracy and AUC metrics, respectively.

Clearly, our framework achieves remarkable results in a very short time, especially for the test that directly provides the operation time.

The proposed framework shows remarkable performance when compared with transfer-learning-based models, deep-learning-based pipelines, specific deep learning methods, and more complex systems comprising them.
