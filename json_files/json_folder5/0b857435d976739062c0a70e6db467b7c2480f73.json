Patients were divided into three groups (HP, CRRT, and HP+CRRT) based on their initial kidney function, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and neutrophil gelatinaseassociated lipocalin (NGAL) as a specific biomarker of acute kidney injury (AKI), diagnosed by an increase in the serum creatinine (SCr) level of at least 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours. Estimated GFR (eGFR) in the HP group was > 60 mL/min. In the setting of AKI, CRRT was performed.

The therapeutic effect was assessed via blood indices including arterial blood gas, PaO 2 and O 2 saturation, hemodynamic parameters (central venous oxygen saturation [ScvO 2 ], oxygen delivery [DO 2 ]), plasma levels of three cytokines (interleukin-1 [IL1], interleukin-6 [IL6], and interleukin-8 [IL8]), and kidney function (blood urea nitrogen [BUN] and SCr). Acceptable treatment outcome was defined as a marked improvement of ARDS severity demonstrated by increase in PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio, O 2 saturation, DO 2 , ScvO 2 , improvement of renal function, and reduction of inflammatory cytokines, norepinephrine, and ultimately improved mortality.

HP was implemented over six hours per day and the number of HP treatments was determined by the plasma levels of the IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8 along with clinical assessment of the patient. A fully automated dialysis machine and a HA380 membrane filter (Jafron Biomedical Co) were used for the HP.Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT): Among patients with direct kidney involvement and a high level of IL-6, the most important causative cytokine in ARDS, a recombinant humanized anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody, tocilizumab (8 mg/kg, at a maximum dose of 800 mg per infusion, with an intravenous drip time longer than 1 h) was used to treat cytokine storm followed by continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH), whereas in the setting of AKI, continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) was performed. CRRT was performed with an ultrafiltration rate of 50-200 cc/h for 24 h every other day. A dedicated machine (PrismaFlex system) and filter (ST150, Baxter) were used for the CRRT. The blood flow rate was set at 50-250 mL/min, and the dialysis rate was set at 25-35 mL/kg/h. Vascular access was obtained using arrow double lumen hemodialysis (12 Fr \u00d7 20 cm) and central venous catheters (CV-15122-F) in the femoral vein. Combined hemoperfusion and continuous renal replacement therapy (HP+CRRT): In this group, patients underwent CRRT plus HP using a HA380 membrane filter, which was changed routinely after 6 hours over the course of 24 hours of CCRT due to the saturation of the adsorptive sites in the aseptic technique step.

Also, higher plasma levels of IL-6 and IL-8 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid are associated with a higher mortality rate(18). We noted that patientswith ARDS had higher levels of IL1, IL6, and IL8, probably leading to an activated systemic inflammatory response.Moreover, patients requiring ICU admission had higher concentrations of proinflammatory mediators than those not requiring ICU admission, suggesting that the cytokine storm might play a crucial role in the severity of the disease(19).The initial concentration of IL1, IL6, and IL8 was elevated and could be used as an index for assessing the blood purifying techniques and hypoxemia prognosis.Therefore, in this study, we divided patients into three groups (HP, CRRT, and HP+CRRT), and the measured cytokines were evaluated to compare the efficacy of each techniques. Data from Italy and China showed extracorporeal organ support therapies, including hemoperfusion, could remove plasma inflammatory cytokines, broadly used in clinical settings to support hemodynamic and organ function recovery(11,19). HP and CRRT achieved high solute clearance rates across a semipermeable membrane and they could eliminate inflammatory mediators from the bloodstream (9).Although it is still controversial whether HP or CRRT is beneficial in viral pneumonia, CRRT is reported to have a positive effect on the reduction of the mortality risk in COVID-19 patients requiring IMV, (10) while other studies found that CRRT is a risk factor for mortality in COVID-19(20). To compare the efficacy of HP and CRRT, we set up groups based on the GFR cutoff, and further divided patients into three groups for comparing plasma cytokine levels, blood gas factors, hemodynamic parameters, BUN, SCr, and the mortality rate. There was no significant differences in the overall survival during ICU stay among the three groups (P > 0.05).Our study has several limitations. First, the sample size of this study was not large. Second, this was a single-center study. Although potentially more patients could be involved in such a study, resource limitation is the main factor limiting this investigation to only one center. Third, patient data was only available until time of discharge which was included in the analysis. This study lacked long-term data.CONCLUSION The best clinical outcome in COVID-19 patients was observed in the HP+CRRT group which not only had a comparatively better survival rate but also demonstrated better improvement in plasma cytokine levels, blood gas factors, and hemodynamic parameters. Role of HP+CRRT needs to be investigated in larger and preferably randomized studies. Approval and Consent to participate Clinical Research Ethics Committee approval was IR.SBMU.NRITLD.REC.1399.011.
