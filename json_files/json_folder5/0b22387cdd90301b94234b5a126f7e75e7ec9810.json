In the first step, sample, sample treatment solution and paramagnetic microparticles coated with SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD antigen are added to a reaction vessel. After incubation, SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD IgG antibodies present in the sample bind to S-RBD coated on microparticles. Afterwards, microparticles are magnetically captured while other unbound substances are removed by washing. In the second step, diluent solution and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) labeled anti-human IgG monoclonal antibodies are added to the reaction vessel to form a structure with the microparticles captured S-RBD IgG antibodies. Then, a substrate solution is added with a resulting chemiluminescent reaction measured as RLUs by a photomultiplier. The amount of anti-S-RBD IgG antibodies prese nt in the sample is proportional to the RLUs generated during the reaction. The cut-off value in AU/mL, the conversion factor to obtain BAU/mL, the cut-off value in BAU/mL and the linearity range in AU/mL are respectively: 10, 0.8229, 8.229, 3.0-1000, as declared by the manufacturer. Samples with values over 1000 AU/mL (822.9 BAU/mL) were diluted and measured 1:10, allowing extension of the dynamic range of analysis to 10000 AU/mL (8229 BAU/mL). The manufacturer states intra-and inter-assay precision between 1.7% and 4.08%, with a clinical specificity of 99.6% (95% CI: 99.3%-99.8%) and a cumulative sensitivity of 99.6% (95% CI 98.9%-99.8%), calculated at 14 days or more, after the first positive PCR. Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S The Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (Roche S-RBD tAb) is an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) for the in vitro quantitative determination of total antibodies (IgG/IgA/IgM) to the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD protein in human serum and plasma, performed by fully automated Roche Cobas E602 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). The assay is a three-step test process that uses a recombinant protein representing the RBD of the S antigen in a double-antigen assay format, which favours detection of high affinity antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Patient samples are incubated with a mix of biotinylated and ruthenylated RBD antigens to form double antigen immune-complexes. After the addition of streptavidin-coated microparticles, DAGS complexes bind to the solid phase. The reagent mixture is then transferred to the measuring cell, where the microparticles are magnetically captured. Electrochemiluminescence is induced by applying a voltage and measured with a photomultiplier. The signal yield increases with the antibody titre.",

The level of agreement between the two assays was evaluated by Cohen's kappa coefficient (\u03ba), assuming a substantial agreement with a \u03ba value of: 0.01 -0.20 slight agreement; 0.21 -0.40 fair agreement; 0.41 -0.60 moderate agreement; 0.61 -0.80 substantial agreement; 0.81 -1.00 almost perfect or perfect agreement. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to compare the six commercial quantitative anti-S protein serological assays. In addition, to assess variability, between-assays coefficients of variation (CV) were calculated and compared between kit's arbitrary unit (AU)/mL and BAU/mL using the Wilkoxon Signed Rank test. CV calculation and correlation analyses were performed only on values comprised inside the linearity range of the method (46 samples included). Finally an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to compare results <1000 and >1000 BAU of the different assays. ICC values less than 0.5 are indicative of poor reliability, values between 0.5 and 0.75 indicate moderate reliability, values between 0.75 and 0.9 indicate good reliability, and values greater than 0.90 indicate excellent reliabilityIn all analyses, a p-value of <0.05 was considered as statistically significant.",
