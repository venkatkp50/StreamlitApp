There is a paucity of data on the prevalence, adequate timing, and outcome of solid organ transplantation after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and the kinetics of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in these patients. Methods. SARS-CoV-2 antinucleocapsid (N) IgG and polymerase chain reaction via a nasopharyngeal swab were analyzed in all patients within 24 h before liver or kidney transplantation. Kinetics of IgG antibodies were analyzed and compared with an immunocompetent cohort. Results. Between May 1, 2020, and March 18, 2021, 168 patients underwent liver or kidney transplantation in our center, of which 11 (6.54%) patients with a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified. The median interval between SARS-CoV-2 infection and transplantation was 4.5 mo (range, 0.9-11). After a median posttransplant follow-up of 4.9 mo, 10 out of 11 patients were alive without clinical signs of viral shedding or recurrent or active infection. One patient without symptom resolution at time of transplantation died after combined liver-kidney transplantation. In 9 out of 11 patients with previously polymerase chain reaction-confirmed infection, SARS-CoV-2 anti-N and antispike (S) IgG were detectable at day of transplantation. Absolute levels of anti-N and anti-S IgG were positively correlated, declined over time in all patients, and were significantly lower compared with immunocompetent individuals. All patients remained anti-S IgG positive until the last posttransplant follow-up, whereas 3 patients became anti-N negative. Conclusions. We observed an uncomplicated course of liver or kidney transplantation after SARS-CoV-2 infection in selected patients. Although having lower absolute IgG antibody levels than immunocompetent individuals, all seroconverted patients remained anti-S IgG positive. These encouraging data need validation in larger studies.",

There might be a significant increase in postoperative morbidity and mortality related to previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. 4, 5 Concerns of prolonged viral RNA shedding, viral reactivation after introduction of immunosuppressive regimens, and patient fitness after COVID-19 should be weighed against the risk of delaying the transplantation and staying on the waiting list. 6 Although most societies recommend applying a time interval between SARS-CoV-2 infection and transplantation, 4, 7, 8 there is a paucity of real-life data on the adequate timing and outcome of solid organ transplantation after SARS-CoV-2 infection. 9, 10 Additionally, the posttransplant kinetics of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (anti-N) and spike (anti-S) proteins in patients with a pretransplant SARS-CoV-2 infection are unknown. In immunocompetent patients, seroconversion for anti-N IgG antibodies occurs on average 1 to 2 d before anti-S IgG antibodies, and antibody levels start to decrease 2 to 4 mo after seroconversion. 2 However, these kinetics might be altered in patients under immunosuppressive therapy after solid organ transplantation. This could impact the risk of (reinfection because anti-S antibodies can block the binding of the virus to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor.",

Both analyses were performed within 24 h before transplantation. Patients were transplanted in the case of a negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR analysis and no other clinical symptoms (ie, fever, acute dyspnea, and oxygen dependency) suggestive for ongoing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Regarding the latter, 1 exception was made for a patient (PCR negative at day of transplantation) who was still oxygen dependent after a critical COVID-19 with intensive care unit (ICU) cholangiopathy and kidney failure and who, therefore, received a combined liver-kidney transplantation. Furthermore, all donors had a negative nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR and a computed tomography thorax unsuspicious of COVID-19.",

We only tested the prevalence of prior infection in patients who ultimately were transplanted. However, we are not aware of documented SARS-CoV-2 infections among our patients on the liver and/or kidney organ waiting list within the study period other than presented in this report. No patients on these waiting lists were permanently delisted or died because of COVID-19. The recommended time interval between SARS-CoV-2 symptom resolution and transplantation varies between transplant societies from 10 to 28 d or is not specified. 4, 7, 8 The median time between positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR and the day of transplantation (all patients PCR negative at day of procedure) in our case series was 4.9 mo, and all but 1 patient had complete respiratory symptom resolution. No clinical signs of viral shedding (based on PCR analysis after transplantation), reactivation, or reinfection were observed in any of the transplanted patients with a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. We applied no specific measures concerning immunosuppression because of pretransplant infection. Of note, reactivation of SARS-CoV-2 after solid organ transplantation has not been reported to date. 4 The 1 patient who died (patient 7 in Table 1 ) received a combined liver-kidney transplantation with an interval of 148 d after a severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, this patient was still oxygen dependent and in an extremely frail condition due to his multiorgan failure and long stay in the ICU until the transplantation procedure. He died from a bacterial and fungal infection with septic shock, pointing to the potential additional risk of bacterial and fungal infections after transplantation, especially in patients who received corticosteroids as targeted therapy for COVID-19. The shortest interval between SARS-COV-2 PCR positivity and transplantation in our study was 26 d in a patient with mild disease (anosmia and loss of taste) who had an uncomplicated postoperative course. Only a few cases of uncomplicated liver or kidney transplantation within a shorter time interval after PCR positivity or even in a patient with an active infection have been reported to date. 10, [12] [13] [14] [15] Taken together, it appears that respiratory symptom resolution and a lack of fever, patient fitness, and PCR negativity (whether or not combined with positive IgG antibodies) are the crucial factors in assessing liver and/or kidney transplant eligibility rather than applying an arbitrary time interval after PCR positivity or symptom resolution. In our opinion, solid organ transplantation in patients with an active infection and respiratory symptoms should be avoided when possible because of the risk of the progression of COVID-19 with subsequent organ failure and death and the risk of viral exposure of the transplant personnel.",

However, SARS-CoV-2 anti-N IgG dropped below the cutoff level in 3 seropositive patients after a median time of 243 d after PCR positivity, whereas anti-S remained positive in all initially seropositive patients at the last follow-up. This is in line with our recent findings suggesting that anti-S IgG antibodies persist longer than anti-N IgG antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 infection. We showed in immunocompetent, nontransplanted patients that at 1 to 3 mo after PCR positivity, 98.3% were positive for anti-S compared with 85.6% for anti-N, whereas at 7 to 10 mo, 92.4% of patients were still positive for anti-S compared with only 17.8% for anti-N. 16 Analyzing SARS-CoV-2 anti-S IgG might, thus, be superior to detect a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and determine the duration of protective immunity. However, the universal SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (based on the endogenous synthesis of antiviral spike protein antibody) will impede the value of anti-S IgG to detect prior infection. Interestingly, we found lower absolute levels of SARS-CoV-2 anti-N and, in particular, anti-S IgG in our transplant patients compared with immunocompetent individuals. The questions on whether this finding does imply a reduced protective immunity and on whether this finding differs from transplant recipients who had a SARS-CoV-2 infection after solid organ transplantation need further study. Overall, more data on the diagnostic accuracy, neutralizing capacities, and the kinetics of the SARS-CoV-2 anti-N and anti-S IgG antibodies before and especially after solid organ transplantation are needed, which is the subject of ongoing research in our center. This knowledge will further clarify the clinic utility of measuring SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in this specific patient population.",

In 3 patients, anti-N IgG disappeared after a median of 243 d (range, 71-326) after positive PCR. In contrast, all patients with documented seroconversion remained anti-S IgG positive until the last posttransplant follow-up visit. Absolute anti-N and anti-S IgG levels were positively correlated (r = 0.58, P < 0.001), and both declined over time in all patients. In 2 out of 11 patients with pretransplant PCRconfirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (patients 6 and 10), anti-N IgG and anti-S IgG were negative at the day of transplantation and remained negative after transplantation. Absolute anti-S IgG levels were significantly lower in both the first 100 d (P = 0.0002) and 100 to 200 d (P = 0.0008) time periods after PCR positivity in our seroconverted transplant patients compared with immunocompetent individuals (Figure 2B), whereas anti-N IgG antibodies were only significantly lower in the first 100-d period (P = 0.0017) (Figure 2A).",
