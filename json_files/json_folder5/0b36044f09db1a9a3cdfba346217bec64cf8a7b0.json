Autoimmune encephalitis and paraneoplastic encephalitis are the most common identifiable etiologies of NORSE; of the known autoimmune encephalitides, <200 cases of GAD65-related epilepsy have been reported in the literature. We describe a case of a 24-year-old female who presented with confusion and myoclonus. Electroencephalogram revealed NORSE that evolved into super-refractory status epilepticus. Her CSF showed a mild lymphocytic pleocytosis, and her MRI demonstrated changes in the bilateral temporal lobes. She was ultimately diagnosed with GAD65 autoimmune encephalitis and treated with immune-modulating therapy. This case highlights the complex diagnostic workup of patients with NORSE and the utility of validated prediction models for diagnosis and prognosis. While maintaining a broad differential, the patient's Antibody Prevalence in Epilepsy (APE) score was a helpful clinical tool to support the pursuit of an autoimmune etiology. We also underline the need to concomitantly treat patients quickly during diagnostic workup because earlier treatment increases the Response to Immunotherapy in Epilepsy (RITE) score, indicating a more favorable prognosis.",

Our patient fulfilled one of the additional conditions: immunotherapy was initiated within 6 months of symptom onset (+2). Subsequently, her RITE score was 8. RITE scores \u22657 have a sensitivity of 87.5% and specificity of 83.8% for predicting favorable seizure outcome as defined by >50% reduction of seizure frequency at the first follow-up.",

While maintaining a broad differential, the patient's APE score can be a helpful clinical tool to support the pursuit of an autoimmune etiology. For GAD65-associated autoimmune epilepsy, we highlight the importance of neurologically specific testing -in this case with a CSF autoimmune panel. We also underline the need to concomitantly treat patients quickly during diagnostic workup: earlier treatment increases the RITE score which can be a helpful clinical tool for prognosis. Our patient received prompt seizure management as well as immunosuppression, including a 5-day course of high-dose steroids and 5 sessions of PLEX. She is currently maintained on a regimen of prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil as well as 4 AEDs (clobazam, valproic acid, levetiracetam, and phenobarbital). A repeat MRI brain performed shortly after hospital discharge (4 months from hospital admission) was significant for age advanced cerebral volume loss and resolution of the previously seen bitemporal hyperintensities. As predicted by her RITE score, the patient has remained seizure free, she improved clinically with inpatient rehab, and as of her 1-year follow-up clinic visit is at her cognitive baseline.",
