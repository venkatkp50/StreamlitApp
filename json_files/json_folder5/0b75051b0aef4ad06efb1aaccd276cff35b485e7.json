These measures include, when possible, avoiding physical contact with the infected person, limiting shared activities and items, wearing a mask, and practicing appropriate hand hygiene. 8 Household contacts of SARS-CoV-2 cases are also encouraged to self-monitor their health status, wear a mask when around others for 10 full days at home and in public, and undergo testing for SARS-CoV-2 at least five full days after last exposure regardless of vaccination status, while unvaccinated household contacts are also encouraged to quarantine. 9 If household contacts develop symptoms, they should get tested immediately and isolate. 9",

[11] [12] [13] [14] [15] For example, the US COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey found adherence to mitigation behaviors when a high number of COVID-19 cases were reported and less adherence when COVID-19 cases were low. 14 Additionally, guidance on mitigation behaviors have changed in relation to the waves of reported cases within the US which likely impacted adherence to these measures over time. Several studies on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in households have examined the impact of specific factors (e.g. demographics and mitigation behaviors) on secondary infection risk in the United States and globally. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] However, there is limited research focusing on predicting factors among household members engaging in mitigation behaviors.",

These sites were chosen because the public health departments and testing laboratories at these sites had established protocols in identifying household SARS-CoV-2 cases quickly during the increase in SARS-CoV-2 variant circulation when this investigation occurred, and there was agreement between these health departments to collaborate on data collection with the CDC. Individuals positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were identified through community testing by the local health department at each site. Households with an RT-PCR confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 were contacted to determine enrollment eligibility. Full details of household selection are reported elsewhere. 22 Household eligibility included having a non-hospitalized case with illness onset \u226410 days prior to enrollment and at least one household contact. Illness onset date was defined as symptom onset date, or, if asymptomatic, date of first positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test. A household contact was defined as a person who spent at least one night in the household during the infectious period (2 days before and 10 days after illness onset) of the primary case. A primary case was defined as the RT-PCR positive individual in the household with the earliest illness onset.",

In particular, the relationship to primary case was found to be a significant characteristic of sleeping in the same bedroom. Among all the relationships assessed, partners of the primary case were most likely to sleep in the same bedroom of the primary case compared to other relationships in a household. This finding is similar to that reported in a study in Brunei which focused on transmission in different settings. 32 The nature of the relationship between parent-child, married couples, and roommate is such that shared activities (e.g., sleeping in the same bed or bedroom) are commonplace. 33, 34 Eating food prepared by the primary case also significantly increased secondary transmission among household contacts in this investigation. It is worth noting that restaurant closures and stay-at-home policies during the pandemic have resulted in shifts to food preparation in the home. 35, 36 There is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is spread though food but rather transmission may occur when a household member gathers with family. 37 Eating food prepared by the primary case may therefore reflect the risk of the primary case not isolating. Parents, siblings, and others related to the primary case were noted as less likely to eat food prepared by the primary case. It is possible they prepared the meals for the primary case. Although we found an association between education level and eating food prepared by the primary case, there was no observable trend. Within the education levels, factors such as risk perception, attitude towards the behavior, knowledge about the behavior as it relates to COVID-19, may have played a role in the reported finding but were not accounted for in our analysis.",

The analysis showed vaccination status was associated with non-significant decreased risks of secondary transmission; however, the number of vaccinated persons at that point in the pandemic was small and statistical power was likely limited. Vaccines have been shown to be safe and efficacious in preventing serious morbidity and reducing risk of mortality by SARS-CoV-2. 41-43 Mitigation should therefore complement effective preventive behaviors and vaccination. 44, 45 Engaging in healthy behavior can be complex and different factors play a role in motivating individuals. 46 Although half of the household contacts who were secondary cases never used masks in the same room or had direct physical contact with the primary case, the findings showed no association with secondary transmission. This finding does not imply these behaviors are not associated with secondary transmission. A potential reason could be that transmission may have occurred before household contacts and primary cases were aware of infection and could have little to do with adherence to mitigation recommendations. Individuals not wearing masks may have done so at a distance from the primary case. Furthermore, when in direct physical contact with the primary case, household contacts may have engaged in effective hygiene practices -all of which are encouraged in CDC guidelines for preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2. 8 Additionally, the small sample size of the investigation may have limited power to detect multiple behaviors associated with transmission or interactions between behaviors.",

Furthermore, because this investigation was conducted in early 2021 near the beginning of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine introductions, the findings are not generalizable to the current context in which vaccine induced and natural immunity are higher. Third, due to eligibility criteria of illness onset \u226410 days prior to enrollment, we assumed all secondary cases were infected by the primary case; we cannot rule-out the possibility of tertiary (contact-to-contact) transmission. Fourth, our investigation did not consider the age of children in the household (specifically young children), a characteristic that may have played a role in the findings on sharing a bed with the primary case and eating food prepared by the primary case.
