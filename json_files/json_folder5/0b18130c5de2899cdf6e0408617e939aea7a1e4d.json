Qualitative research has not yet fulsomely explored the risk, resilience, and identity intersections that impact vulnerable SGMY wellbeing. Methods: This digital photo-elicitation study (QueerView) recruited thirty SGMY (aged 14-29) from priority populations that had one or more of the following experiences: trans and gender diverse, homelessness, child welfare, and immigration. From submission of fifteen photos representing resilience and a semi-structured interview via web conferencing, constructivist grounded theory was utilized for multimodal analysis of photos, interview video, and interview transcript. Triangulation, an audit trail, and member checking were employed to support trustworthiness. Results: A visual model emerged showing how participants work towards an integrative self, with themes of reflecting and knowing, discrimination and intersectional challenges, connecting, performing, curating, coping, (re)defining and (re)creating, growing and being. Sub-themes of the impact of family dynamic and values, mental health and trauma, and the cathartic benefit from advocacy and leadership offered insight. Participant images were captured in a digital gallery. Conclusions: QueerView animates the complex lives of multiply marginalized SGMY and their intersectional strengths and challenges while demonstrating the utility of a digital multimodal approach.",

            "text": "Digital technologies often provide a space for sexual and gender minority youth (SGMY) whose sexual orientation, gender identities, and expressions are considered nonmajority (not cisgender, heterosexual); including but not limited to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and non-binary (Craig et al., 2017b) , to engage with others and develop their identities (Marwick et al., 2010) . SGMY report that these online communities allow them to build confidence, hope, and belonging, which ultimately drive a desire to live (Austin et al., 2020) . Such experiences are critical, given that SGMY experience heightened adversity and oppression during their adolescence and young adulthood compared to their heterosexual, cisgender peers (Berghe et al., 2010) . Such experiences contribute to social isolation, mental health issues, substance use, and suicidality (McDonald, 2018) , which have lasting implications on their physical, emotional, and social selves (Craig & Austin, 2016) . SGMY's negative health and mental health outcomes (e.g., depression and suicidality) are attributed to minority stress-the internal and external stressors that are specific to those with a sexual or gender identity that differs from common societal expectations (Meyer, 2003) . These stressors can manifest in institutional and individual forms such as public policy, internalized stigma, microaggressions, transphobia, and violence. Early work about minority stress explores the relationship between sexual minority identities in relation to other identities such as gender and socioeconomic status (Brooks, 1981; Rich et al., 2020) and the differences in stress appraisal across individuals, which is often dependent on their coping resources. Meyer (2015) describes resilience for sexual minority youth as a process of experiencing these stressors, both distal (external) and proximal (internal) through harnessing their coping skills in order to positively impact their mental and physical health. The utilization of digital technologies and social media has been found to contribute to the resilience of SGMY even in the face of traumatic events (Craig et al., 2020a) and is considered safer than offline activity due to the greater ability to produce, manage, and remain in control of their identities and overall comfort online (Craig et al., 2015) . Given these experiences, digital research methods are accessible, appropriate and potentially preferable to capture the lived experiences of SGMY.",

Given that SGMY represent a diverse collective of youth with various sexual orientations, gender identities and expressions, and that their experiences as SGMY may be influenced by various identities related to other forms of oppression (i.e., race, ethnicity, disability, and poverty), employing an intersectionality framework allows for a nuanced exploration of their lived experiences. The term \"intersectionality\" is not all-encompassing with one specific interpretation (Collins, 2012) as both oppression and privilege exist within one's intersectional identities, which may be fluid over time and influenced by the political, environmental, and personal context (Hulko, 2009) . Using an intersectional lens serves to explore how all identities interact with one another (Hulko & Hovanes, 2018) and allows for an analysis of power when conducting research with SGMY (Wagaman, 2014) . Intersectionality research with SGMY encourages exploration of the ways in which their LGBTQ+ identity interacts with oppressed and privileged identities (Sterzing et al., 2017) and allows for more effective interventions that helping professionals can utilize to meet the diverse needs of SGMY (Huang et al., 2020) .",

Intersectionality theory within qualitative research extends beyond methodology and can be consistently applied throughout different stages of the research process (Abrams et al., 2020) .

            "text": "Resilience is considered a social ecological construct (Luthar et al., 2000; Ungar, 2011) which describes how people utilize internal skills and coping strategies in order to thrive and overcome adversities and trauma (Masten & Powell, 2003; Ungar, 2008) . From a holistic perspective, and in relation to LGBTQ+ youth research, resilience can be defined as an integrated process that does not occur in isolation within an individual, but rather across external systems (Colpitts & Gahagan, 2016) . Despite the oppression and violence SGMY experience within families, schools, and their broader communities, they constantly adjust their coping mechanisms to promote resilience and overall wellbeing (DiFulvio, 2015) . Contributors to resilience in SGMY include social connectedness, self-efficacy, and healthy coping as they form supportive and empowering relationships where their identities are valued (Amodeo et al., 2018; Craig et al., 2015) . Research using minority stress and intersectionality theory has noted that stress encountered by SGMY with multiple marginalization is challenging but also provides an opportunity for developing resilience (Craig et al., 2017a; Meyer, 2010) . Such post-traumatic growth is frequently witnessed in research with SGMY (Joseph et al., 2012) . For example, an investigation of Latinx/ a SGMY found that youth leveraged those intersections in ways that supported their own and their families' understanding and reflection of familial expectations and supports (Craig et al., 2017a) . Resilience studies are compatible with intersectionality when they consider the individual's social location, acknowledge the interaction between community and individual level attributes in analysing their navigation of adversity, and account for access to social resources (Bowling et al., 2019) . Before engaging with resilience frameworks within qualitative research, it is crucial that researchers challenge themselves to openly accept the narratives while also analysing the resilience processes that may not be explicitly stated by participants (Liebenberg et al., 2014) .",

Adverse childhood experiences or ACEs (e.g., abuse, familial rejection, family conflict) often precipitate homelessness or housing instability (Flentje et al., 2016) and SGMY are disproportionately affected by ACEs (Craig et al., 2020a) . Homelessness precipitates psychological and physical distress that for SGMY can be compounded by increased stress concerning their gender and sexuality (Kattari et al., 2017) . SGMY experiences of homelessness are heterogenous; for example, trans men are at triple the risk of severe mental and physical health disorders compared to cisgender men due to homelessness (Keuroghlian et al., 2014) .

Newcomer SGMY may face homophobia from their families and diaspora communities, as well as racism from white LGBTQ+ people Chiang et al., 2019; Lewis, 2016) . Further, refugee claimants must repeatedly come out to numerous decision makers and retell their traumatic stories of persecution, which poses risks of re-traumatization (Lee & Brotman, 2013) . New SGMY immigrants can feel disconnected from their sexual and gender identities as well as their cultural identities (Fuks et al., 2018) . Qualitative research with SGM refugee and asylum seekers has found that they experienced challenging mental health concerns (Alessi et al., 2015) and exhibited resilience. Despite the challenges facing newcomer LGBTQ+ youth, there have also been investigations into the resiliency that youth with multiple marginalization are able to build alongside coping strategies as they grow through these adversities (Chiang et al., 2019; Li et al., 2017) .",

Photo elicitation serves as an alternative to the traditional interview approach as the incorporation of photos provides a stimulus for the elicitation of deeper narratives (Frith & Harcourt, 2007) . Harper (2002) suggested that such method is distinct due to the physiological merits of engaging the part of the brain that processes visual information. Photo elicitation helps in rapport building in the researcher-participant dyad context and allows for the bridging of the cultural worlds between them (Meo, 2010) . This method is typically participant driven, as participants take or select the photos that guide the interviews, which helps to maintain the focus of the research on the participants and perspectives and responses within their context (Epstein et al., 2006) . Photographs can \"generate data that illuminate a subject invisible to the researcher but apparent to the interviewee\" (Clark-Ib\u00e1\u00d1ez, 2004 , p. 1516 and is beneficial when exploring personal aspects of human identity, culture, and community as photographs help to tap into different realms within one's consciousness (Harper, 2002) . Due to its exploratory nature, photo elicitation can foster participant empowerment and creativity as it rejects a structured interviewer led format (Padgett et al., 2013) and allows participants to access emotional responses with more ease. The use of a camera and reflecting on the images have been perceived as an \"emotional catharsis\" by participants (Padgett et al., 2013 (Padgett et al., , p. 1442 . Photos are also not restricted to following a linear or procedural process within the interview which allows for flexibility and spontaneity where the participant can control what photo they discuss and what memories or experiences are associated with it (Lapenta, 2011) .",

The four priority populations identified above were explicitly mentioned in the recruitment flyer and dyadic questions were posed in the screening survey to confirm identities/experiences.

After submitting their photos, participants were invited to attend a semistructured interview conducted by one of two graduate research assistants (both social workers) trained in photo elicitation interviewing. Interviews were conducted via Zoom web conferencing software and ran from 1.5 to 2 hours. Study procedures were reviewed verbally for the purpose of confirming ongoing consent. The semistructured interview guide included questions on participants' personal meanings of intersectionality and resilience, perceptions of online and offline lives, and how they navigate adversity. The \"share screen\" feature was used by the interviewers to display participant photos and ask probing questions about participants' feelings and emotions about the image connected to their resilience as SGMY. Interviews were video recorded via Zoom, and the recording was transcribed via natural language processing using NVIVO 12 (QSR International, 2020) and minor transcription errors were subsequently corrected by research assistants.",

Each interview was coded twice by two independent coders who were trained graduate students from ethnically diverse backgrounds identifying primarily as SGMY. Given that constructivist grounded theory situates the researcher as co-constructing meaning and considers context (Charmaz, 2014; Priya, 2019) , annotations were used to describe processes occurring in the research (such as interview interruptions, or instances when interview content and nonverbal communication were discordant as well as the researcher's reactions and interpretations) and captured in the multimodal analytic process designed by the first and second authors in a previous study with SGMY (Craig et al., 2021) . Initial coding consisted of systematically identifying codes in vivo based on the photos, interview videos and transcripts (Charmaz, 2014) . Focused and axial coding confirmed codes against emerging themes and a model emerged that captures intersectional conception of resilience and identity (Charmaz, 2014) . This model was created as a data map using Mindmeister software (Mindmeister, 2020) . Data triangulation was designed to support rigour and to capture multiple processes and included side by side coding of the three types of data from each interview (Natow, 2019) . To further enhance trustworthiness, each coder maintained an audit trail (Cutcliffe & McKenna, 2004) , the research team met four times in three-hour meetings to discuss codes and emergent themes, and member checking was used. An additional consent process was then employed whereby a research coordinator emailed participants individually with photos and quotes that were planned to be used in dissemination and obtained specific consent for use of participant contributions. Member checking was employed in October 2020 whereby seven participants attended a Zoom video call with the researchers in which the emerging themes were discussed, and the data map was reviewed. The remaining 23 participants elected to receive a summary of the findings by email. All participants agreed that the findings reflected their experiences and contributions to the study. Further, participants were given the opportunity to consent to have any of their images featured in an online gallery that is part of the INQYR Rainbow Road living research timeline (https://www.inqyr.org/timeline.html).",

Racism, ableism, homophobia, and transphobia have impacted youth in both online and offline spaces. This caused participants to experience internalized conflict between their own identities and experience challenges with mental health through this trauma (Figure 1 ). Most participants declined to have photos published per this theme, as the photos frequently referred to family and intimate relationships in their lives. For instance, one youth described that they are proud of their Asian and Queer identities but the conflict that they experience due to their family's values raises some internal concern and worry about disclosing their Queer identities. I don't know being Asian and being Queer, even though it doesn't feel like wrong to me, it's just like with my family in a way like my extended family and my dad like the way they're brought up. They were raised, some people were like raised in different countries and stuff with different ideals and so like it like makes me feel, it makes me feel really terrified to tell them about my Queer identity and so in that way. I feel like it doesn't fit well, like it doesn't . . . it feels normal to me, like I'm proud of it but it's just in that way it makes me terrified to share that with people in my family that, umm maybe think the way that they do because they were raised with another country with like they're around that culture and that certain culture. (Age 17, Queer, TGD, Queer) Sexual and gender identities were part of common intersectional challenges for youth, but their cultural identities also influenced their self-image and the ways in which they felt like they could find connection and value amongst others.

And it was very jarring for me, because everyone was speaking Bangali. Everyone was from like, from Bangladesh. They were raised there and they're only here for studying. And it was one of those experiences where I felt like I had to leave as soon as I got there. Because I -as much as I don't fit in with people that aren't Bangladeshi that can't understand like where I come from.

Because as far as they knew I was getting what I was -what was coming for me, you know? But I'm still here, still living my best life. (P19, Age 19, TGNC, Lesbian, Homelessness)",

Interpersonal connection happens in many external online and offline spaces, influencing an intrapersonal or \"internal\" process of connecting where participants feel affirmed and increasingly comfortable with their own intersecting identities. External connection is a way for participants to bond with people they might not have access to through online spaces or affirming people external to their family home. Intrapersonal connection often occurs through the ways in which participants utilize coping and self-care mechanisms such as through art, care for animals, or music which increases their selfaffirmation and identity development. As one participant said when speaking about technology and developing a support system (Figure 4 ), This one is from my first year of university with that group of people who were the first kind of queer and mentally ill people who I had met.

Some participants found the ability to cope through their love for a pet. Animals were a common element of promoting participant wellbeing. Other participants found moments of solitude in nature as a way to relax and decompress from stress. One participant discussed how meditation helped them to slow down and reconnect. So I think it was the beginning of high school. I used to go to an arts high school and everyone there was so creative and the energy was so like everywhere and sporadic and my brain was just like everywhere at all times. And I would get home and I'd be so tired all the time. And there was I think I think that was on YouTube. And like someone I followed was like, yeah, I started meditating to just slow down and throw all the garbage out of my brain that I don't need for the next day. I was like, oh, my God. That was amazing. (Age 18, TGD, Pansexual, Homelessness) Creative outlets like writing and drawing also assisted participants to cope with challenges that they were facing in online and offline spaces. One participant described their artwork in the following way: \"I think though that the looseness of the faces represents like, you know, just like a disconnect between my personality, myself, and my body. I sort of see things that way, loose like that.\" (Age 21, TGD, Bisexual, Homelessness, Child welfare).",

(Age 21, TGD, Bisexual) Other participants redefine their offline life in ways that promote safety while affirming their identities. One participant described the way they used clothing to promote their identity while avoiding confrontation or conflict with their family members. This participant's family would not allow them to dress in \"feminine\" clothing. As a result, the participant redefined what clothing they could wear by accepting gender neutral pieces in order to appease family and, more importantly, feel more secure in their gender identity. Another participant hosted events and created spaces offline, not only for themselves, but to reach other Queer students with similar intersectional identities within science (Figure 9 ). But so they were like, yeah. It's so great to see someone in a position of leadership on LGBT men who like East Asian and like holding like this position is play such a big leadership position like speaking on stage in front of everyone and organizing this event, and it means a lot that I wasn't expecting that message.

Their insights contributed to a model of working towards their integrative selves both online and offline. This involved accepting their intersectional identities while they were also growing and evolving. Online communities provided space to evolve and grow in a safe way where these identities and feelings of belonging could be translated offline. For example, participants took control of their online content and actively pursued positive experiences.

While studies have been conducted with SGMY who are trans and gender diverse (Rimes et al., 2019) , homeless (Flentje et al., 2016) , in the child welfare system (Forge et al., 2018) , and immigrants, newcomers, and refugees , this study offers new insight at the intersection of these vulnerable identifies and experiences. Participants actively explored their own experiences of resilience as they reflected upon their past and the challenges they faced internally and externally. Importantly, study participants had a range of traumatic experiences in families and systems that had significant long-term impacts on their mental health and wellbeing. Developing an understanding of how they navigated those intersecting challenges, such as a history of child welfare involvement through multiple foster carers compounded by housing instability, can enable more prepared systems. However, participants consistently complemented their challenges with the privileges they held within the same stories of pain and rejection. These privileges not only included identities, such as being trans and gender diverse and navigating a gender identity and presentation that differed from their sex assigned at birth, but the communities that participants were able to connect with online and offline, such as those formed during the immigration process or focused on SGMY and their interests. This is consistent with what Meyer (2003) refers to as group or community coping (Meyer, 2003; Sterzing et al., 2017) . Importantly, youth maintained that finding communities of SGMY who also shared their cultural, ethnic, and religious identities were valuable and sharing a singular identity such as gender was not always fulfiling and conducive to building their sense of self. Ultimately, the insights from this study uncover facilitators and barriers to SGMY's efforts to become a truer version of themselves both online and offline.",

The digital photo elicitation methods provided access to a range of SGMY, including those with mental health struggles, and provided an opportunity for youth to manage their own data and research process. For example, many participants chose photographs that they had previously saved on their personal electronic devices as they had stated that some of these photos had been posted on their social media accounts. This also highlights the temporal value of the research as it showcases how the past has been interwoven with stories of the present and hopes for the future. Pictures from the past can simultaneously represent what they have been through, how they have grown and what they hope for in the future. When analysing the selected photographs, it was evident that they were not exclusively related to online or offline experiences. Many selfies or \"planned\" pictures also seemed to reflect aspects of both online and offline identities as participant stories unravelled within the interviews. For example, some participants chose selfies or photographs that were important and sentimental to reflect their offline lives that fit well with the theme \"Connecting.\" These visuals showcased items or activities (e.g., artwork, animals and pets, nature, plants, games cosplay) that helped them in their lives as they were experiencing discrimination and intersectional challenges.
