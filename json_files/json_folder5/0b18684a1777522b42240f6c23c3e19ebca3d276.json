Although some antiretroviral drugs have been proposed to protect against COVID-19, the data remain uncertain [9, 10] . Importantly, the common occurrence of co-factors such as diabetes and chronic renal and pulmonary disease [11] , alongside disadvantageous socioeconomic variables [12] , may increase the risk of adverse outcomes among PWH who acquire SARS-CoV-2.",

These studies have often been limited by small sample sizes, lack of direct comparative data from people without HIV, or inability to adjust for comorbidities. Some reports indicated that PWH did not experience higher rates of COVID-19 related hospitalization or mortality than people without HIV [14, 21] , whereas others suggested increased disease severity [9, 20] . Importantly, preliminary data from South Africa indicated that despite effective ART, HIV infection more than doubled the risk of COVID-19 related mortality [23] .",

No deaths were recorded among PWH after day 28. Followup was censored for patients transferred to another facility at date of transfer; among those with unknown outcome, it was censored on the last recorded date of follow-up where they were known to be alive. For patients who died, were transferred or discharged on the date of admission or who had no further follow-up recorded beyond the first day, we recorded 0.5 days of follow-up. The primary analysis used a Kaplan-Meier approach to display the cumulative M a n u s c r i p t 8 mortality over this period and in strata defined by sex and age. Cox proportional hazards regression with the Efron method for ties was then used to describe the association of mortality with HIV status, before and after adjustment for the following potential confounders: sex, ethnicity, age (in quadratic form), indeterminate/probable hospital acquisition of COVID-19 (as defined above), and ten separate comorbidities at admission (a series of binary variables to indicate the presence or absence of each of chronic cardiac disease, chronic pulmonary disease, chronic renal disease, diabetes, obesity, chronic neurological disorder, dementia, liver disease [mild, moderate or severe], malignancy, and chronic hematological disease). These variables were selected a priori. We also included adjustment for the baseline date to account for changes in mortality over time. For partially missing comorbidity data, we assumed missing comorbidities were absent. Participants with completely missing comorbidity data were excluded from these adjusted analyses. We fitted a further model adjusting for disease severity a at presentation, defined as oxygen saturation <94% on air or receiving oxygen therapy, in order to assess whether risk of mortality in PWH could be explained by a different stage of disease advancement at hospitalization. Finally, we repeated the same analysis among individuals aged 70 year. A series of sensitivity analyses were performed: i) we repeated the analyses after censoring follow-up on the day of discharge; ii) we included those with definite hospital-acquired COVID-19; iii) we used symptom onset date as the baseline date for all; iv) we excluded PWH lacking a record of ART; v) we excluded those without a recorded positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result; vi) we calculated propensity scores for HIV-positive status using a logistic regression model based on sex, ethnicity, age (in quadratic form), indeterminate/probable hospital acquisition of COVID-19, smoking status, baseline date, and ten comorbidities, and included the propensity score in a univariate Cox regression model for death at 28 days; vii) we considered a binary endpoint of 14-day mortality and performed logistic regression (with the A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 9 same confounder adjustment as described above); and viii) we used a competing risks regression model with discharge as a competing risk for mortality. In PWH, we used a Cox proportional hazard model to investigate associations with day-28 mortality. Analyses were conducted in Stata v16.1 (Statacorp, TX, USA).",

Persistent immune dysfunction may be the consequence of advanced immunocompromise prior to the start of ART, as defined by a low nadir CD4 cell count and inverted CD4:CD8 ratio. In the UK, 43% of people newly diagnosed with HIV in 2018 had a CD4 count <350 cells/mm 3 , a threshold indicative of significant immunosuppression [26, 30] . Furthermore, current guidelines about starting ART at the time to diagnosis were implemented relatively recently, whereas in the past ART initiation in the UK was deferred until the CD4 count had declined below thresholds of initially 200, then 350 and subsequently 500 cells/mm 3 [6, 30] . Thus, many older PWH in the UK (and worldwide) will have experienced years of uncontrolled HIV replication prior to commencing treatment and may also have received earlier regimens of suboptimal efficacy, with potentially lasting effects on immune function [30, 31] . Immunological studies will be required to confirm these hypotheses. ",

Nonetheless, after careful considerations, our analysis of the outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the UK shows an increased risk of day-28 mortality due to HIV-positive status. As the pandemic continues to spread, including in areas of increased HIV prevalence, it is important to record the HIV status of people hospitalized with COVID-19 and gather further data to corroborate our findings and confirm the population-specific determinants of outcomes. Meanwhile, emphasis for PWH should be placed on early HIV diagnosis, prompt ART initiation, and optimized screening for and control of comorbidities including obesity and diabetes.",
