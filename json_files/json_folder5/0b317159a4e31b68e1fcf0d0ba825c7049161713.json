One of the striking targets amongst all the proteins in coronavirus is the main protease (M pro ), as it plays vital biological roles in replication and maturation of the virus, and hence the potential target. The aim of this study is to repurpose the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved molecules via computer-aided drug designing against M pro (PDB ID: 6Y2F) of SARS CoV-2 due to its high x-ray resolution of 1.95 \u00c5 as compared to other published M pro structures. High Through Virtual Screening (HTVS) of 2456 FDA approved drugs using structurebased docking were analyzed. Molecular Dynamics simulations were performed to check the overall structural stability (RMSD), Ca fluctuations (RMSF) and protein-ligand interactions. Further, trajectory analysis was performed to assess the binding quality by exploiting the protein-residue motion cross correlation (DCCM) and binding free energy (MM/GBSA). Tenofovir, an antiretroviral for HIV-proteases and Terlipressin, a vasoconstrictor show stable RMSD, RMSF, better MM/GBSA with good cross correlation as compared to the Apo and O6K. Moreover, the results show concurrence with Nelfinavir, Lopinavir and Ritonavir which have shown significant inhibition in in vitro studies. Therefore, we conclude that Tenofovir and Terlipresssin might also show protease inhibition but are still open to clinical validation in case of SARS-CoV 2 treatment.",

            "text": "An unusual strain of CoV, SARS-CoV-2, caused an atypical pneumonia outbreak in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and was termed Coronavirus disease 2019 . The World Health Organization has stated COVID-19 a pandemic, and urgent treatments are required as the world is stepping into a phase that is beyond containment. All the efforts are being made to curb the spread of the disease, but it is difficult to develop new medications for a rapidly mutating virus like SARS CoV 2. Drug repurposing is a new promising approach in which already approved and available drugs are being used to fight against rare diseases (Strittmatter, 2014) . The broad-spectrum antiviral drugs are ideally suited for such outbreaks; the main motive here is not to necessarily understand all mechanisms of action of a broad-spectrum antiviral drug but instead choosing a drug with minimum side effects. Earlier repurposing therapy was successful in diseases such as HIV/AIDS (Zidovudine), erectile dysfunction (Sildenafil), Parkinson's disease (Atomoxetine), Breast cancer (Raloxifene), Epilepsy (Topiramate). Advantages in using a previously available drug is that the chance of failure is reduced, the time and cost required to develop a new drug is also reduced (Xue et al., 2018) . Various computational and experiment-based studies are conducted on drug repurposing, for example, gene association, pathway mapping, molecular docking, clinical analysis, novel data sources, in vitro and in vivo screening, etc (Pushpakom et al., 2019) . According to a study Ombitasvir, a Hepatitis C polymerase inhibitor, was 'repurposed' to target and prevent beta-tubulin driven breast cancers (Karuppasamy et al., 2017) . Further, these days computer-aided studies are being conducted which are quite beneficial and reduce the manpower and related resources.",

            "text": "In silico studies are useful in target identification and protein structure determination; with the help of computeraided drug designing, the structure of the target is identified . Recently, scientists have started exploiting computational resources to explore the mechanisms of action, or the efficacy of a drug towards a target. Experimental studies capture some properties, but in order to analyze the interactions between the inhibitor and protein, and to access the conformational changes at the molecular levels, computational simlations are encouraged (Boopathi et al., 2020) . Recently, the efficiency of an antiviral drug, Darunavir was analyzed against the binding site i.e. the major flap region of the protease (HIV-1). Thus, computer aided drug designing and analysis can provide an insight into various unknown mechanisms (Karuppasamy et al., 2017; Purohit & Sethumadhavan, 2009 ). Docking and molecular dynamic studies are proved to be excellent tools in designing new drugs . In the case of COVID-19, many studies have provided a blueprint about the structure of the virus. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped viruses containing positive-strand RNA and have spikes of glycoproteins that project from their viral envelopes and give them a corona or halo-like appearance. Strains of CoV were the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2002 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemic in 2012. The viral genome is the largest known RNA genome, it ranges from 26 to 32 kb, and the viral particle has a diameter of 125 nm (Gonz alez-Andrade et al., 2016) . The CoV proteins help in replication, and some of them also contribute to the interactions between the host and the virus. This genome act as mRNA on infecting a cell and leads to synthesis of 2 long polypeptides that are responsible for further infection. It produces structural and non-structural proteins. Structural protein includes membrane protein (M), envelope protein (E), spike protein (S), nucleocaspid protein (N) and proteases. These proteins are present in viral membrane and comprise different functions, like the RNA genome assembly is carried by N protein and viral assembly by M and E protein. The NTD of the nucleocaspid protein aids in the formation of ribonucleoprotein complex that is necessary for viral replication. According to an in silico study, theophylline and pyrimidone derivatives can be considered as the probable inhibitors of RNA binding to the NTD of N protein . The trimeric glycoprotein S guides the entry of the virus into the host cells Zhavoronkov et al., 2020) . The CoVs share structural similarities, but they undergo genetic evolutions that provide new targets for antiviral vaccines and therapies. Various targets have been explored; many researchers are targeting these proteins which play a key role in viral replication because of their different mechanisms of action. Different studies are performed on the basis of structural aspects and variant functions and one of the potential and highly conserved targets is protease. Targeting protease can obstruct with its post-translational modifications and thus prevent the viral invasion into the human body. A characteristic CoV contains at least six open reading frames (ORFs) in its genome (Mousavizadeh & Ghasemi, 2020) which are responsible for encoding the non-structural proteins (NSPs). The two large non-structural viral polyproteins, PP1a and PP1ab are produced due to the translation of ORF1a and ORF1ab. The viral-encoded proteases are used for processing of NSPs to their functional forms. The two major proteases that have gained importance these days and that are potential targets for COVID-19 are the papain-like protease (PL pro ) and a 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL pro ), which are also known as the main protease (M pro ) (B aez- Santos et al., 2015) . For the replication and transcription of virus M pro and PL pro play essential roles, cysteine and histidine are responsible for cleavage of the NSPs. The main protease 3CL pro that is detected in the COVID-19 resembles 96% to the SARS COV; it has two identical subunits that form a dyad, which together forms the active sites responsible for its cleaving property. M pro is a $ 306 aa long protein, and PL pro has a catalytic core domain of 316 amino acids responsible for cleavage of replicase substrates (Holmes, 2003) . M pro cleaves the polyprotein's C-terminal and slice at eleven sites, whereas PL pro works at the N-terminal, cleaving three specific sites in the polyprotein . As both 3CLpro and PLpro are cysteine proteases, covalent inhibitors with high potencies can be potentially developed for precise targeting . Similarly, sixteen NSPs are cleaved and processed that have an essential role in the formation of the replicase complex, which is further exploited by the virus for replication and transcription. PLpro can remove ubiquitin from the ubiquitinated proteinase from the interferons and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) of host cell, so that the interferons are not produced and thus the innate immune system is compromised. Deubiquitination can inactivate the pathway for nuclear factor j-light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NFjB), this causes suppression of immune system of the host. Therefore, proteases can be a potential target to cure patients of COVID-19 and these are highly conserved sequences. Various studies are performed to identify therapeutics against SARS COV and MERS COV due to similarity in their structures. Proteases are targeted earlier in various viral diseases, for example in case of HIV and Hepatitis C, and with sudden outbreak of COVID-19 there is an urgent need for the treatment.",

Therefore, previously available medicines, already approved by the FDA, are widely being tested for various targets in COVID-19. Medications that are recently considered for antiviral treatment include hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), Lopinavir, Ritonavir, Ledipasvir, Velpatasvir, and Nelfinavir. Although treatment with hydroxychloroquine has recorded a decline in the number of cases, the safety profile is also necessary, and therefore few studies have discussed this point. The benefit of the HCQ \u00fe Azithrol treatment is research in progress, as a lot of uncertainty prevails . Through in silico research (Liu & Wang, 2020) showed that the binding active site for Lopinavir/ Ritonavir is conserved between SARS-COV-M pro and 2019-n COV M pro. Lopinavir and Ritonavir are used to target protease in HIV, and they were successful in inhibiting the main protease; these drugs can form H-bonds with amino acid Thr24-Asn28, Asn119 and thus can interfere with the COVID-19 binding.",

(2020) , which depicted the conserved cleavage sites of 3CL pro as in SARS-COV, and they also used Ledipasvir or Velpatasvir as a repurposing therapy. Further , using homology modeling and docking studies proposed that Nelfinavir might be a potential inhibitor against n2019-n COV M pro . Liponavir and Saquinavir have been proved to block CoV protease, although Lopinavir is a more potent inhibitor than Saquinavir. Most drugs involved in repurposing to target COVID-19 are known to target critical components in the viral lifecycle. For example, medications like Umifenovir and chloroquine hinder the entry of viral particles into the host cells. Lopinavir/Ritonavir, ASC09, or Darunavir block viral replication by inhibiting 3CL protease. Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Ribavirin is proved to inhibit viral RNA synthesis (Harrison, 2020) . The novelty of the study is in the approach applied for the high throughput virtual screening of potent ligands. The study focusses on the utilization of computational methods to screen potent lead within FDA approved molecules exhibiting efficient binding profile with SARS-CoV-2 M pro protein. This was assessed using the combinatorial scheme of analysis of binding free energy trend in MD simulations, protein-ligand binding profile and conformational dynamics-based approach of correlated protein-residues interaction. The MD simulation output of protein-ligand frames helped to understand the conformational alterations during the entire 100 ns simulation duration. The DCCM analysis was performed to understand the diverse correlated motion of the aminoacid residues in the Mpro protein. This study shows noticeable conformational shifts in Mpro which are induced by FDA candidate molecules in comparison with the unbound (apo) and co-crystallized ligand (O6K) binding dynamics. A brief illustration of the methodology is depicted in Figure 1 .",

We conducted 100 nanoseconds molecular dynamic simulation (MDS) for each protein to understand the conformational changes that the protein undergoes after interacting with different ligands. The statistics obtained from the trajectory aided in investigating the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) and Root Mean Square Fluctuations (RMSF). The structure of proteins, conformational versatility, and stability were analyzed by comparing the RMSD of each ligand-bound complex with the unbound form (Apo) and reported inhibitor (O6K)-protease complex. During the MDS, the Ca-RMSD for respective drug molecule-M pro complexes is aligned with the RMSD spectra of Apo form and O6K-bound form of the M pro Figure 3 . The average RMSD value for Apo form and O6K-bound M pro was observed to be 2.319 and 1.976 \u00c5, respectively.

(2020) ; the amino acid residues contacting with Nelfinavir and Entecavir include THR26, GLY143, HIS41, GLN189, and GLU166 (Huynh et al., 2020) . Nelfinavir is one of the top drugs in this study, which also shows similar protein-ligand interactions (HIS41, GLU166). It possesses the most stable RMSD (2 \u00c5) and RMSF (0.851 \u00c5) even when compared to the O6K and Apo forms, the RMSF of O6K and Apo was 0.941 \u00c5 and 0.867 \u00c5, respectively. The MM/GBSA score of its MD trajectory is comparatively good \u00c095.76 kcal/mol compared to O6K \u00c050.9 kcal/mol. The DCCM analysis also shows an enhanced correlation in residue motions. Moreover, Nelfinavir is also reported recently in various in vitro studies as a probable treatment for SARS CoV 2. Yamamoto et al. (2020) suggest that the effective concentrations of Nelfinavir to inhibit SARS Cov 2 would be 1.13 lM and 1.76 lM, respectively, at 50 percent and 90 percent inhibition. Similarly, a systemic screening of HIV inhibitors concludes that MesilateViracept (Nelfinavir) strongly inhibits S-n-and S-o-mediated cell fusion with full inhibition at a concentration of 10 lM (Musarrat et al., 2020) .",

These repurposed drugs combination can be useful in targeting SARS-CoV 2 . Lopinavir is an antiretroviral protease inhibitor that is already used for treating HIV since the 2000s. Ritonavir, along with other drugs, is a highly active antiretroviral therapy prescribed for treating HIV; therefore, it is preferred in combination with other protease inhibitors. In our study, Lopinavir and Ritonavir are amongst the top compounds which show good binding with the protease. Ritonavir and Lopinavir show a stable, less fluctuating RMSD than the unbound and native inhibitor and depicts a stable Ca-RMSF. Ritonavir possesses the best MM/GBSA score \u00c0107.6 kcal/mol, and Lopinavir also has a high score of \u00c091.22 kcal/mol.

This lowering of protein RMSD is in synergy with the lowest observed deviation in the 100 ns MD trajectory's free energy change. This is attributed to its efficient occupancy of the binding site with the least conformational fluctuation. Tenofovir possesses relatively low RMSF of around 0.899 \u00c5, 0.956 \u00c5, and 0.875 \u00c5, respectively, with the residues in contact Figure 4 .

An in silico drug repurposing research is conducted here to detect a potential inhibitor to target the key protein protease of SARS-CoV 2. A group of compounds representing a higher binding affinity towards protease active site were selected after high throughput virtual screening the entire FDA approved drug library. The top compounds obtained in our study are already in in vitro studies, such as Ritonavir (involved in highly active antiretroviral therapy), Lopinavir (involved in combination therapy with Ritonavir), and Nelfinavir (involved in combination therapy with Ritonavir). Terlipressin shows the closest similarity to these drugs, identical to the outcome of their trajectories, and provides a better result according to the Apo form and O6K. Extensive analysis of Terlipressin reveals marginally superior ligand activity as deduced from DCCM and interaction profile compared to the unbound, O6K, and reported antivirals. Moreover, Tenofovir was likewise observed to be a potent ligand for the M pro inhibition site, given that it displays decent interaction and correlation among M pro residues upon contact. The results obtained in this study using computational tools efficiency can lead to drug discovery against new diseases and might constrain the viral protease. Bearing in mind the time required to advanced therapeutics during the pandemics, drug repurposing seems to be the most alluring and upfront method in targeting SARS CoV 2. Such in silico trails can be useful in designing and testing drugs against SARS CoV 2 and enhance the drug discovery pipeline, predicting the therapeutic failures and diminishing undesired side effects. Further, a compound library targeting protease protein can also be developed for rapid screening against other deadly viruses, in which proteases serve as a crucial protein for the viral transmission.",
