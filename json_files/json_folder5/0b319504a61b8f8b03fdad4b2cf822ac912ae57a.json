Despite its urgency, we still do not fully understand the molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and its ability to antagonize innate immune responses. SARS-CoV-2 leads to shutoff of cellular protein synthesis and overexpression of nsp1, a central shutoff factor in coronaviruses, inhibits cellular gene translation. However, the diverse molecular mechanisms nsp1 employs as well as its functional importance in infection are still unresolved. By overexpressing various nsp1 mutants and generating a SARS-CoV-2 mutant in which nsp1 does not bind ribosomes, we untangle the effects of nsp1. We uncover that nsp1, through inhibition of translation and induction of mRNA degradation, is the main driver of host shutoff during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, we find the propagation of nsp1 mutant virus is inhibited specifically in cells with intact interferon (IFN) response as well as in-vivo, in infected hamsters, and this attenuation is associated with stronger induction of type I IFN response. This illustrates that nsp1 shutoff activity has an essential role mainly in counteracting the IFN response. Overall, our results reveal the multifaceted approach nsp1 uses to shut off cellular protein synthesis and uncover the central role it plays in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, explicitly through blockage of the IFN response.",

Binding of IFN to its cognate receptor in autocrine and paracrine manners leads to the propagation of the signal and to the expression of hundreds of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) that act to hamper viral replication at various stages of the viral life cycle (Schoggins, 2019) . In the case of SARS-CoV-2, increasing evidence suggests that the lack of an effective type I IFN response plays a critical role in pathogenesis (Hadjadj et al., 2020; Hartenian et al., 2020; Meffre and Iwasaki, 2020; Sa Ribero et al., 2020) .",

Specifically, SARS-CoV-2 encodes at least ten proteins whose over-expression counteracts the induction and antiviral action of IFNs (Sa Ribero et al., 2020) . In addition to immune evasion, all viruses rely on the cellular ribosomes to translate their mRNAs into polypeptides. A common viral strategy to achieve this is to impair the translation of cellular mRNAs in a process termed \"host shutoff\". Host shutoff is thought to contribute to viral takeover in two main ways: It helps to redirect translational resources and specifically ribosomes toward viral mRNAs and it blocks the ability of infected cells to mount an efficient antiviral response (Stern-Ginossar et al., 2019) .",

            "text": "Viruses utilize diverse strategies to shutoff host protein synthesis, including interference in: mRNA transcription; processing and export out of the nucleus; and induction of mRNA degradation, as well as inhibition of the translation machinery (Stern-Ginossar et al., 2019) . Coronaviruses (CoVs) are known to cause host shutoff, and several strategies have been proposed for how CoVs shutoff host protein synthesis (Abernathy and Glaunsinger, 2015; Nakagawa and Makino, 2021; Nakagawa et al., 2016) . We recently demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to a reduction in translation capacity, degradation of host mRNAs, and repression of nuclear mRNA export (Finkel et al., 2021a) . Although several viral proteins were suggested to play a role in SARS-CoV-2 induced shutoff (Banerjee et al., 2020; Lei et al., 2020; Miorin et al., 2020; Shemesh et al., 2021; Vazquez et al., 2021) , nsp1 is the best characterized shutoff factor. Furthermore, studies with mutants lacking nsp1 in mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and in SARS-CoV illustrate nsp1 is a major pathogenesis factor of beta CoVs (Jimenez-Guarde\u00f1o et al., 2015; Shen et al., 2019; Z\u00fcst et al., 2007) Fundamental early work on SARS-CoV nsp1 (Huang et al., 2011; Kamitani et al., 2006; Lokugamage et al., 2012; Narayanan et al., 2008) together with recent studies on SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 show it interferes with host protein synthesis through several potentially distinct molecular mechanisms. Nsp1 binds directly to the 40S ribosomal subunit, and its C-terminal domain physically blocks the mRNA entry channel, leading to reduction in translation both in vitro and in cells (Lapointe et al., 2021; Schubert et al., 2020; Thoms et al., 2020; Tidu et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020) . However, the extent by which the virus overcomes this nsp1-mediated translational block and how nsp1's effects on translation come into play during infection remain largely unclear. In addition to blocking translation, SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 also promotes cellular mRNA degradation and viral transcripts are refractory to these effects through their 5' leader sequence (Finkel et al., 2021a; Mendez et al., 2021) . Finally, nsp1 was also shown to interact with the export factor NXF1 and to inhibit the nuclear export of cellular transcripts (Zhang et al., 2021) . These findings portray complex interactions of nsp1 with the post-transcriptional life of mRNAs. Since there is extensive cross-talk between export, translation and degradation, and perturbation of one can lead to indirect effects on the others, it remains critical to evaluate the extent by which nsp1 directly perturbs each of these cellular functions and to measure the contribution of each function to the total shutoff effect. Furthermore, since various other viral proteins were suggested to interfere with cellular gene expression (Addetia et al., 2021; Banerjee et al., 2020; Hsu et al., 2021) and since host shutoff is thought to serve two independent purposes (to increase viral transcript translation and to inhibit the antiviral response), deciphering the role nsp1 plays in host shutoff in the context of infection and untangling its functional significance represent a critical knowledge gap.",

We illustrate that nsp1 mediates its function by accelerating mRNA degradation, inhibiting translation and interfering with nuclear mRNA export, and we show that these mechanisms are likely distinct and complementary. We further generated a SARS-CoV-2 mutant in which nsp1's ability to bind to the ribosome and to degrade cellular mRNAs is abolished. Using this mutant, we show that nsp1 is the main shutoff factor of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we demonstrate that relative to cellular genes, nsp1 enhances the translation of viral genes. However, since nsp1 profoundly reduces the overall translation capacity in infected cells, in absolute terms (not relative to cellular genes), viral gene expression in cells infected with an nsp1 mutant virus is intact. Finally, we reveal the propagation of the mutant virus is inhibited both in-vitro, in cells with functional IFN response, and in-vivo, in infected hamsters and this attenuation is due to stronger IFN response. These results illustrate the multifaceted approach nsp1 uses to shut off cellular protein synthesis and the critical and specific role nsp1 plays in blocking the type I IFN response during SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

        {
            "text": "We have previously demonstrated that in addition to SARS-CoV-2 nsp1's ability to inhibit translation (Lapointe et al., 2021; Schubert et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020; Thoms et al., 2020; Tidu et al., 2020) , it also promotes RNA degradation (Finkel et al., 2021a; Mendez et al., 2021) . In SARS-CoV nsp1, ribosome binding as well as residues R124/K125 are required for nsp1induced host mRNA degradation activity (Kamitani et al., 2009; Lokugamage et al., 2012) . Since nsp1 from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are highly similar (84% identity in amino acids), we examined whether these residues are necessary for mRNA degradation also in SARS-CoV-2. We generated two nsp1 mutants. In the first mutant, nsp1-\u0394RB (RB stands for ribosome binding), we removed amino acids 155-165, that are located in the C-terminal region of nsp1 and are critical for nsp1's interactions with the ribosome (Schubert et al., 2020; Thoms et al., 2020; Tidu et al., 2020) . In the second, nsp1-CD (CD stands for cleavage defective), we mutated R124 and K125 to alanine (R124A/K125A) (Figure 1a ). We show that nsp1-WT, but not nsp1-\u0394RB, associates with ribosomes (figure 1b), as previously reported (Mendez et al., 2021; Schubert et al., 2020; Thoms et al., 2020) . In agreement with recent results (Mendez et al., 2021) , nsp1-CD is still associated with ribosomes but to a lesser extent compared to nsp1-WT ( Figure 1b) . Notably, we noticed that nsp1 also likely represses its own expression, as the level of nsp1-WT protein was lower compared to the mutants that are likely functionally defective (Figure 1b and extended figure 1a ). To test the inhibitory effects of these nsp1 mutants, we examined the expression of two GFP reporters, one in which the GFP is fused to human betaglobin 5' UTR (host-5'UTR-GFP) and a second in which the GFP is fused to the viral 5' leader sequence (CoV2-leader-GFP). These reporters were co-transfected with vectors encoding nsp1-WT, nsp1-\u0394RB, nsp1-CD or a control plasmid. Nsp1-WT and to a lesser extent nsp1-CD suppress the expression of host-5'UTR-GFP, whereas nsp1-\u0394RB had no major effect on GFP expression ( Figure 1c ). The GFP reduction mediated by nsp1-WT was associated with ~6 fold reduction in GFP mRNA levels, whereas the levels of GFP mRNA were not affected by nsp1-CD or nsp1-\u0394RB expression (Figure 1d) . These results illustrate that as was reported for SARS-CoV nsp1 (Kamitani et al., 2009; Lokugamage et al., 2012) , binding to the ribosome is critical for promoting RNA degradation. Furthermore, since nsp1-CD maintains the ability to suppress cellular RNA translation, albeit to a lesser extent than that of nsp1-WT, but does not lead to mRNA degradation, these results indicate that the induction of RNA degradation and translation inhibition represent two distinct activities. In contrast to host-5'UTR-GFP and in agreement with previous findings (Finkel et al., 2021a; Mendez et al., 2021; Tidu et al., 2020) , nsp1-WT did not inhibit, and even slightly increased, the level of CoV2-leader-GFP. Interestingly, in agreement with a recent publication (Mendez et al., 2021) , nsp1-CD represses GFP expression even when it is fused to the CoV2-leader. Finally, as expected, nsp1-\u0394RB had no major impact on CoV2leader-GFP expression ( Figure 1e ). Analysis of RNA expression demonstrated that CoV2leader-GFP was refractory to nsp1-WT induced degradation and similarly to host-5'UTR-GFP both nsp1-CD and nsp1-\u0394RB did not drastically affect CoV2-leader-GFP RNA expression ( Figure 1f ). We next examined how nsp1 affects translation that is mediated by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). To this end, we used a bicistronic mRNA, in which expression of the upstream Renilla luciferase is mediated by cap-dependent translation and expression of downstream firefly luciferase is driven by EMCV IRES (Figure 1g ). Nsp1-WT and to a lesser extent nsp1-CD but not nsp1-\u0394RB suppressed the production of both Renilla and Firefly luciferases, indicating nsp1 inhibits both capped as well as IRES driven translation ( Figure 1g ). Furthermore, nsp1-WT but not nsp1-\u0394RB or nsp1-CD induced endonucleolytic cleavage of the mRNA (Figure 1h ). Overall, these results show that SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 blocks translation and induces endonucleolytic cleavage of cellular RNAs that leads likely to their degradation. Nsp1 binding to the ribosome is essential for both these activities but since not all translation block lead to RNA degradation these activities likely represent distinct functions. a, Schematic illustration of the nsp1-\u0394RB and nsp1-CD mutation. b, 293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing nsp1-WT, nsp1-\u0394RB, or nsp1-CD, and ribosomes were pelleted. Nsp1 protein levels in the input and in the ribosome pellet (RBP) were measured by Western blot with Strep-Tactin. RPS6 and GAPDH were used as ribosomal protein and loading controls, respectively. Right panel presents the ratio of the strep signal in the RBP to input, which was assessed using the intensity of the bends. Points show technical replicates, * = p<0.05 and ** = p<0.01 for a two tailed t-test. c-f, 293T cells co-transfected with plasmids expressing nsp1-WT, nsp1-\u0394RB, or nsp1-CD or a control plasmid together with (c and d) a reporter plasmid expressing GFP fused to human beta-globin 5'UTR (host-5'UTR-GFP), or (e and f) the SARS-CoV-2 5'leader sequence (CoV2-leader-GFP). (c and e) GFP expression was measured by flow cytometry. (d and f) Relative GFP mRNA levels were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. 18S ribosomal RNA was used as a normalizing gene. Points show measurement of technical replicates. (g and h) Vero E6 cells were co-transfected with the reporter plasmid containing a cap-dependent Renilla luciferase followed by an EMCV IRES and Firefly luciferase (pRL-EMCV-FL) along with pCAGGS empty vector (EV) as a control plasmid or a plasmid expressing nsp1-WT, nsp1-\u0394RB or nsp1-CD. No T/F represents non-transfected cells. (g) Luciferase expression levels. Y-axis represents light units. (h) RNAs were extracted and analyzed by Northern blot using a digoxigenin-labeled rLuc riboprobe. RNA size marker is a mixture of in vitro-transcribed RNA transcripts, RNA 1 and RNA 2, as shown. RNA 1 contains the region from the 5'-end to the 3'-end of the intercistronic region of pRL-EMCV-FL, and RNA 2 contains the region from the 5'-end to the end of the rluc ORF in pRL-EMCV-FL.

            "text": "On top of the effects of nsp1 on translation and RNA degradation, nsp1 was demonstrated to block nuclear mRNA export through interaction with NXF1 (Zhang et al., 2021) , representing an additional mechanism through which nsp1 inhibits cellular gene expression. Notably, the interactions of nsp1 with NXF1 were suggested to be mediated by nsp1 N-terminal region (amino acids 1-129, figure 1a), and therefore are likely independent of nsp1 binding to the ribosome (Zhang et al., 2021) . Indeed, using both host-5'UTR-GFP and CoV2-leader-GFP, nsp1-\u0394RB still had a small effect on GFP expression compared to the control protein (1.5-fold and 1.3-fold relative reduction in MFl [median fluorescence intensity], respectively). To examine if nsp1 affects mRNA export and if this activity is maintained in the absence of ribosome binding, we transfected 293T cells with plasmid expressing nsp1-WT, nsp1-\u0394RB or GFP (as a control) and assessed subcellular localization of polyadenylated transcripts by cytoplasmic/nuclear (cyto/nuc) fractionation followed by RNA-seq. Fractionation efficiencies were confirmed by comparing expression values of known nuclear and cytoplasmic RNAs as well as snoRNAs nuclear enrichment (extended figure 1b and c). In addition we obtained a strong correlation between our cyto/nuc measurements and measurements conducted previously in a different cell type (Finkel et al., 2021a ) (extended figure 1d). In agreement with nsp1 inhibiting mRNA export, nsp1-WT expression led to relative nuclear enrichment of cellular transcripts ( Figure 2a) . Furthermore, this enrichment did not depend on nsp1 induction of mRNA degradation, as nsp1-\u0394RB expression also led to relative nuclear enrichment, and the effects were even stronger than those of nsp1-WT. The stronger effect of nsp1-\u0394RB was unexpected but could be attributed to the stronger expression of nsp1-\u0394RB due to self-inhibitory effects of nsp1-WT (extended figure 1a) . Indeed, analysis of nsp1 expression from the RNA-seq data showed that nsp1-\u0394RB expression was 8-fold higher compared to nsp1-WT (extended figure 1e). Furthermore, it is possible that in the absence of binding to the ribosome more nsp1 was free to interact with NXF1. Altogether these measurements show that nsp1 is able to target three distinct steps in the host cell mRNA biogenesis pathway and that its ability to interfere in mRNA export does not depend on its binding to the ribosome.",

Since we observed significant differences in the expression of nsp1-WT, nsp1-\u0394RB and nsp1-CD that are due to nsp1 self-inhibition, we fused the CoV2-5' leader sequence upstream of the nsp1 constructs, to confer protection from self inhibition. In agreement with our GFP reporter results, nsp1-WT with the CoV2-leader was refractory to its self-inhibitory effects and its expression was even enhanced compared to the mutated constructs with the CoV-2 5'leader (extended Figure 2a) , further illustrating that nsp1-WT promotes the translation of transcripts that contain the CoV2 5'leader.",

This approach allows measurement of endogenous mRNA half-lives based on 4thiouridine (4sU) incorporation into newly transcribed RNA. After RNA extraction, 4sU is converted to a cytosine analogue using iodoacetamide, and these U to C conversions are identified and quantified by RNA sequencing, providing means to quantify old and new mRNAs and to calculate mRNA decay (Finkel et al., 2021a; Herzog et al., 2017; J\u00fcrges et al., 2018) . We applied SLAM-seq to 293T cells transfected with plasmids expressing nsp1-WT, nsp1-CD, nsp1-\u0394RB or GFP as control (Extended figure 2b). We obtained all characteristics of highquality SLAM-seq libraries; >8000 quantified genes, U-to C-mutation rates starting at ~1.5% and rising to ~5.5% and an increase with time in the portion of labeled RNA, which was stronger in cells expressing nsp1-WT, indicating a faster turnover of RNA in these cells (extended figure 2c-d). There was strong correlation between half-lives estimated from our SLAM-seq measurements in the control cells (transfected with GFP) and previous half-lives measurements in a different cell type (Finkel et al., 2021a ) (extended figure 2e), indicating the robustness of our measurements. Reassuringly, analysis of nsp1 expression from the RNA-seq reads demonstrated an equivalent expression of all constructs (extended figure 2f), illustrating that addition of the CoV2-5' leader to nsp1 mRNA indeed prevented the nsp1 mRNA degradation. Importantly, we observed a substantial reduction in cellular mRNA half-lives in cells expressing nsp1-WT but not in cells expressing nsp1-\u0394RB or nsp1-CD (Figure 2b ), indicating induction of significant mRNA degradation only by nsp1-WT. Furthermore, although the measurements were conducted in different cell types, we observed significant correlation between the profile of mRNA degradation that is induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection (Finkel et al., 2021a) and the degradation induced by nsp1-WT but not by nsp1-\u0394RB or nsp1-CD (figure 2c, extended figures 3a and 3b). This indicates that nsp1 plays a major role in inducing RNA degradation in infected cells and that this degradation is dependent on nsp1 ribosome binding. In accordance with our measurements in infected cells (Finkel et al., 2021a) , expression of nsp1-WT, but not of nsp1-\u0394RB or nsp1-CD, led to a more substantial reduction in the half-lives of cytoplasmic transcripts compared to transcripts that are mostly nuclear (Figure 2d and extended figures 3c and 3d). We also observed significant correlation between the translation efficiency of cellular genes and their half-life reduction following nsp1-WT expression ( Figure 2e ). We analyzed transcripts features that are associated with sensitivity to nsp1-induced degradation and the two features that best explain the sensitivity of mRNAs are cytosolic localization and higher translation efficiency (extended figure 3e). Overall, these findings demonstrate that induction of mRNA degradation is a distinct function of nsp1 which is independent of export inhibition, and is mainly directed at cytosolic mRNAs which are engaged with the ribosome. a, Distribution of the cytosolic to nuclear ratio of cellular transcripts in 293T cells transfected with nsp1-WT, nsp1-\u0394RB, or control expression plasmids that were subjected to subcellular fractionation followed by RNA-seq. b, Distribution of cellular transcript half-lives in 293T cells transfected with nsp1-WT, nsp1-\u0394RB, nsp1-CD, or control expression plasmids.

This mutant is similar to the nsp1-\u0394RB in the expression studies described above. Deep sequencing confirmed the introduced deletion (extended figure 4a), and there were no additional nucleotide alterations within the nsp1 gene or along the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Our initial characterization of the CoV2-mut was conducted in Vero cells (kidney epithelial cells from African green monkey) which are type I IFNdeficient (Emeny and Morgan, 1979) . Cells infected with wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (CoV2-wt) or CoV2-mut produce similar levels of nsp1 protein (Figure 3a) , confirming that the short deletion in nsp1 did not alter its expression. The majority of the nsp1-wt and nsp1-\u0394RB accumulated in the cytoplasm in infected cells but nsp1-\u0394RB also showed perinuclear localization (Figure 3b ), potentially reflecting stronger engagement with nuclear export machinery in the absence of ribosome binding. Infection with CoV2-mut or CoV2-wt exhibited comparable levels of viral mRNAs at 18hpi (Figure 3c ) as well as of the viral N protein (Figure 3d ). Overall, these experiments illustrate that infection of Vero cells with CoV2-mut resulted in viral gene expression which is comparable to that of CoV2-wt.",

            "text": "We next analyzed the propagation of CoV2-mut and CoV2-wt in both Vero cells and Calu3 cells (lung adenocarcinoma cells), which have intact IFN-response. Both cells efficiently support SARS-CoV-2 replication (Finkel et al., 2021b) . In Vero cells CoV2-mut titers were overall similar to CoV2-wt and at 48 hpi were even slightly higher than CoV2-wt ( Figure 3e ). In contrast, in Calu3 cells viral titers of CoV2-mut were lower compared to the CoV2-wt ( at 48 hpi p = 0.00018 by t-test, Figure 3e ) and this attenuation in CoV2-mut growth was also observed along a longer time course at a lower MOI (extended figure 4b). Consistent with the growth kinetics, analysis of viral gene expression using RNA-seq shows comparable levels of viral RNAs from the CoV2-wt and CoV2-mut along infection in Vero cells ( Figure 3f ). In contrast, in Calu3 cells, despite similar initial levels of viral RNAs, at 24 and 48 hpi viral gene expression was considerably lower for CoV2-mut compared to CoV2-wt ( at 24 hpi p = 0.0016, and at 48 hpi p = 0.0004 by t-test, Figure 3f ). The similar propagation of CoV2-mut and CoV2-wt in Vero cells versus the attenuation of CoV2-mut in Calu3 cells points that inhibition of viral propagation due to nsp1 mutation is due to host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and not to direct effects of nsp1 on viral gene expression. Since the IFN response is critical to SARS-CoV-2 propagation (Felgenhauer et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2021; Lei et al., 2020; Mantlo et al., 2020; Xia et al., 2020) and it is compromised in Vero cells (Emeny and Morgan, 1979 ) extended figure 4c), we speculated that these differences are due to nsp1's interference, or lack thereof, with the IFN response. Indeed, analysis of changes in cellular gene expression showed a stronger induction of ISGs in Calu3 cells infected with CoV2-mut compared to those infected with CoV2-wt (p value = 1.55x10 -114 , Figure 3g ). In contrast, no differences in the response to the two viruses were observed in infected Vero cells ( Figure 3g ). To confirm that the observed inhibition in viral growth is indeed due to a more potent IFN response, we tested if the inhibition of IFN signaling by Ruxolitinib (a selective JAK-STAT inhibitor (Jackson et al., 2016) ), can rescue CoV2-mut propagation in Calu3 cells. Indeed, CoV2-mut propagation in Calu3 cells was rescued by Ruxolitinib treatment, whereas propagation in CoV2-wt was impacted to a reduced extent ( Figure. 3h). We further confirmed that Ruxolitinib treatment abolished the differences in ISG expression between CoV2-mut and CoV2-wt infection (Extended Data Fig. 4d ). Overall, these results illustrate that the altered activity of nsp1 impairs the propagation of SARS-CoV-2 due to an enhanced IFN response.",

In line with the early time points of the growth kinetics in Calu3 (figure 3e and 3f), at 8 hpi there were no substantial differences in the infection efficiency of the two viruses (extended data 5a), allowing for direct molecular dissection of the effects of CoV2-wt and CoV2-mut on cellular and viral gene expression.",

We infected Calu3 cells with CoV2-wt or CoV2-mut or mock infected, and measured nascent protein synthesis levels in mock infected cells and at 4, 5 and 7 hpi. CoV2-wt infection led to significant reduction in global translation levels already at 4 hpi which was augmented with time, and at 7 hpi translation activity was reduced by 4-fold ( Figure 4a ). In contrast, CoV2-mut had no major effect on the overall translation levels in infected cells ( Figure 4a ). These results illustrate that nsp1 is the main driver of translation shutoff during SARS-CoV-2 infection, and that this effect is mediated by its binding to the ribosome.",

            "text": "The OPP-labeling experiments provide an absolute measure of translation in infected cells, yet they do not indicate how much of the translation capacity is dedicated to the translation of viral genes. In order to gain a detailed view on the relative levels of viral and host translation, and to decipher the importance of nsp1 for viral RNA translation during infection, we infected Calu3 cells with with CoV2-wt or CoV2-mut and harvested infected cells at 4 and 7 hpi as well as uninfected cells for RNA-seq and ribosome profiling. Metagene analysis, in which gene profiles are aligned and then averaged, revealed the expected profiles of footprints and mRNAs (extended data 6a and 6b). Using this data, we quantitatively assessed the expression pattern of cellular and viral transcripts. In order to evaluate the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to co-opt the host ribosomes we calculated the translation efficiency (TE, ratio of footprints to mRNAs for a given gene) of viral and cellular mRNAs in infected cells. We then compared the TE of human genes to that of viral genes at each time point with each virus. The analysis shows that when cells are infected with CoV2-wt viral gene translation efficiencies fall within the low range of cellular gene translation ( Figure 4b and extended figure 6c ). This indicates that in cells infected with CoV2-wt, viral transcripts are translated with efficiencies that are slightly lower than those of host transcripts. This could be attributed to the sequestration of vast amounts of viral RNA in doublemembrane replication compartments, rendering them inaccessible to the ribosomes (Wolff et al., 2020) . Importantly, in cells infected with CoV2-mut especially at 4 hpi, viral gene translation efficiency relative to cellular genes was reduced (Figure 4b and extended figure 6c ). This relative reduction in the translation efficiency of viral genes in cells infected with CoV2-mut virus shows that nsp1, through its binding to the ribosome, promotes viral mRNA translation in infected cells. However, it is important to note that in absolute terms, in cells infected with CoV2-wt the overall translation levels are reduced by approximately 4-fold compared to cells infected with CoV2-mut (Figure 4a) , and that ribosome profiling-based measurements provide only relative values of translation. Therefore, it is likely that the absolute translation of viral genes in cells infected with CoV2-mut was comparable or even more efficient than the translation of viral genes in cells infected with CoV2-wt. a, Protein synthesis measurement by flow cytometry of Calu3 cells infected with CoV2-wt or with CoV2mut (MOI = 3) for 4, 5 and 7 hpi or an uninfected control following O-Propargyl Puromycin (OPP) incorporation and fluorescent labeling using Click chemistry b, Cumulative frequency of human (line) and viral (dots) genes according to their relative translation efficiency (TE) in cells infected with CoV2-wt (blue) or with CoV2-mut (red) at 4 hpi.

To estimate global mRNA levels, we quantified the levels of rRNA and of total RNA extracted from uninfected Calu3 cells and from cells infected with CoV2-wt or CoV2-mut. We observed no substantial differences in either total RNA levels or in rRNA levels (extended data 7a-d). We then sequenced total intracellular RNAs, without rRNA depletion, to assess the relative abundance of cellular and viral mRNAs in uninfected Calu3 and cells infected with the two viruses at 4 and 7 hpi. We found that during infection with CoV2-mut, viral transcripts are produced to the same levels as CoV2-wt (Figure 5a ). This shows that even in infected Calu3 cells, during the initial infection, there is no major defect in viral gene expression. However, infection with CoV2-wt was associated with a ~2-fold reduction in cellular mRNA which was not observed in CoV2-mut infected cells (Figure 5a ). These results indicate that during infection with CoV2-wt, there is both production of viral transcripts and a concomitant reduction in the levels of cellular transcripts. Whereas, during infection with CoV2-mut the production of viral RNA is maintained but there seems to be no major interference in cellular RNA expression and the levels of cellular mRNAs resemble the levels in mock-infected cells.",

We found that compared to infection with CoV2-mut, infection with CoV2-wt led to stronger reduction of transcripts that mostly localize to the cytoplasm (p value = 5.2x10 -318 Figure 5b ), indicating the reduction in cellular transcript is driven by nsp1-induced degradation that occurs in the cytosol. To directly measure the role of nsp1-ribosome binding to induction of mRNA decay in infected cells, we applied SLAM-seq on uninfected cells and cells infected with CoV2-wt or CoV2-mut. We obtained all characteristics of high-quality SLAM-seq libraries (extended data 8a and 8b), and strong correlation with our previous measurements of mRNA half-life from uninfected and infected cells (Finkel et al., 2021a) (extended data 8c and 8d). Importantly, we observed a substantial reduction in cellular mRNA half-lives upon infection with CoV2-wt, whereas the mRNA half-life in CoV2-mut-infected cells were comparable to the levels measured in mock infected cells (Figure 5c , 5d and extended figure 8e), illustrating that mRNA degradation in infected cells is mediated by nsp1 binding to the ribosome. Furthermore, in agreement with our overexpression experiments, the reduction in half-life correlated with cytosolic localization (Figures 5e and 5f) and with the translation efficiency (Figures 5g and 5h) of host transcripts in cells infected with CoV2-wt, but not in those infected with CoV2-mut. Together these findings demonstrate that the degradation of cellular mRNA during SARS-CoV-2 infection is entirely mediated by nsp1 and is dependent on its interaction with the ribosome.",

We therefore examined our data to assess whether increased intronic reads are still detected in cells infected with CoV2-mut, when there is no substantial RNA degradation. Whereas infection with CoV2-wt led to a relative increase in intronic reads, infection with CoV2-mut did not (Figure 5i ).

We infected two groups of eight hamsters, with CoV2wt or with CoV2-mut. We measured the weight of the hamsters daily, and collected lung and nasal turbinate (NT) tissues at 3-and 7-days post infection (dpi). Hamsters infected with CoV2mut did not exhibit a significant change in body weight compared to uninfected hamsters, while CoV2-wt infected hamsters began exhibiting a gradual decrease in body weight from day 2 reaching a statistically significant difference compared to CoV2-mut hamsters at day 6 and remained significant at day 7 (p value = 0.0093 and p value = 0.0049 by t-test , Figure 6a ). We next quantified viral titers in lungs and NT in hamsters from both groups. In agreement with the differences in weight loss, at 3 dpi, viral titers were significantly lower in the CoV2-mutinfected hamsters compared to the CoV2-wt-infected hamsters in both the lung (p value = 0.0008, t-test) and NT ( p value = 0.0004, t-test) (Figure 6b ). At 7 dpi, CoV2-mut-infected tissues were already cleared from the virus and viral titers were below the threshold of detection, whereas CoV2-wt virus was still significantly detected in both the lung (p = 0.0249, ttest) and the NT ( p < 0.0001, t-test, Figure 6c ).",

In the case of SARS-CoV-2, several viral ORFs have been suggested to interfere with cellular gene expression, including nsp1. We show here that nsp1 is responsible for the shutoff in protein synthesis during SARS-CoV-2 infection, and its activity is mediated by three distinct mechanisms: translation block, induction of mRNA degradation and interference in nuclear mRNA export. Using reporters and broad measurements of translation and degradation promoted by WT and nsp1mutant viruses, we show that the degradation and translation inhibition activities occur in the context of an nsp1-ribosome interaction whereas the nuclear export activity does not significantly contribute to the global shutoff observed in infected cells, and is independent from nsp1 binding to the ribosome.",

            "text": "Despite numerous studies, it remains unclear how viral transcripts overcome nsp1-mediated translation suppression and specifically how this evasion relates to the translation and degradation activities of nsp1. Our results together with recent studies (Bujanic et al., 2021; Finkel et al., 2021a; Mendez et al., 2021; Vora et al., 2022) show that in the setting of nsp1 overexpression, cellular mRNA translation is strongly inhibited by nsp1. The observation that nsp1-CD, which does not lead to mRNA degradation, inhibits translation to a lesser extent than WT nsp1, suggests that both the translation inhibition and the degradation activities contribute to nsp1's ability to shutoff cellular protein synthesis. It is clear that the viral 5'leader sequence, which is shared by all viral transcripts, allows transcripts to evade the inhibition imposed by nsp1 overexpression, but whether this reflects evasion from nsp1 induced degradation, evasion from the nsp1-mediated block in translation or evasion from both activities is harder to dissect. Our measurements, in combination with recent work (Finkel et al., 2021a; Mendez et al., 2021) , clearly show that the viral 5' leader sequence makes mRNAs refractory to nsp1-mediated degradation. With regard to evasion from nsp1 translational block, two models could potentially explain viral mRNA escape. One posits that nsp1 blocks the translation of both cellular and viral transcripts, but since cellular transcripts are degraded, viral mRNAs remain the only available target for ribosomes that are not inhibited by nsp1. The other model proposes that viral mRNAs are refractory to suppression by nsp1, as they interact with nsp1 in a manner that causes a change in its conformation, removing its C-terminal domain from the ribosome entry channel and facilitating viral RNA translation (Mendez et al., 2021; Shi et al., 2020; Tidu et al., 2020) . These two models may not be mutually exclusive and both mechanisms may contribute to the evasion of viral mRNAs from the nsp1 translational block. The observation that nsp1-CD, which contains two point mutations in the N-terminal region, does not degrade cellular mRNAs, and in contrast to nsp1-WT also inhibits the translation of mRNA containing the viral 5' leader sequence, could be reconciled by both of these models. If these specific mutations in the Nterminal region affect the ability of nsp1 to interact and recognize the viral 5' leader sequence as was recently suggested (Mendez et al., 2021) , it would explain why translation of viral mRNAs is inhibited by this nsp1 mutant. On the other hand, since nsp1-CD does not lead to cellular mRNA degradation, the competition of viral mRNAs over ribosomes that are not blocked by nsp1 will grow, and this can also contribute to reduction in viral mRNA translation. Our measurements from CoV2-wt-infected cells indicate that viral mRNAs are not preferentially translated compared to cellular transcripts. However, a major limitation of these measurements is that viral mRNA replication and transcription is massive, and occurs within a unique endomembrane system (Wolff et al., 2020) that would thus render much of the viral mRNA inaccessible to ribosomes. This inaccessibility of potentially large portions of viral RNA will skew our measurements and it is likely the true translation efficiency of viral transcripts is significantly higher. Comparing the translation efficiencies of viral and cellular transcripts in cells infected with CoV2-wt or with CoV2-mut allowed us to overcome this limitation and to demonstrate that in infected cells nsp1 indeed specifically promotes the translation of viral transcripts compared to cellular transcripts, as we observed that in cells infected with CoV2-mut, viral genes are translated even less efficiently compared to their cellular counterparts. However, at the same time our measurements of the overall translation capacity in infected cells, using incorporation of OPP into nascent chains, show that nsp1-WT leads to a major reduction in the absolute levels of translation in infected cells. Since the vast majority of mRNA in infected cells is viral mRNA this means that viral mRNAs translation is likely also inhibited in the presence of nsp1. Together these results support a model in which nsp1 acts as a strong inhibitor of translation that tightly binds to ribosomes and thus inhibits the translation of both viral and cellular mRNAs. Viral transcripts through their 5'leader can at least partially escape this translation repression, making them less sensitive to nsp1 mediated translation inhibition. At the same time, ribosome bound nsp1 also leads to accelerated degradation of cellular but not of viral mRNAs providing means for viral mRNAs to quickly take over and dominate the mRNA pool. The accumulation of SARS-CoV-2 mRNAs and the ability of these transcripts to partially evade nsp1 mediated repression explains how infected cells so effectively shutoff the synthesis of cellular proteins while switching to translation of viral mRNAs.",

Our broad measurements, both by over-expression and in the context of infection, show that nsp1 accelerates the degradation of cytosolic RNAs, and specifically the ones that are more highly translated. Since nsp1 is physically bound to the ribosome and the degradation depends on this interaction, an appealing speculation is that nsp1 recruits a cellular nuclease whose activity relates to mRNA translation surveillance.

Activation of the type I IFN response leads to the induction of hundreds of ISGs in infected as well as in neighboring cells, directing cells into an antiviral state. It is therefore likely that the stronger induction of ISGs during infection with CoV2mut represents elevated levels of type I IFN production. Since SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to IFN treatment (Felgenhauer et al., 2020; Katsura et al., 2020; Mantlo et al., 2020; Shemesh et al., 2021; Vanderheiden et al., 2020) , differences in IFN production, which affects both infected cells and neighboring cells, can explain the inhibition in CoV2-mut propagation. Supporting this notion are recent findings showing nsp1-deficient replicons are more sensitive to IFN treatment (Ricardo-Lax et al., 2021) .",

Although SARS-CoV-2 encodes additional inhibitors of the innate immune defenses, and specifically the IFN response (Xia et al., 2020) , we show that a loss in nsp1 activity renders the virus vulnerable to immune response both in-vitro in cells with intact IFN response and in-vivo in hamsters. Mechanistically we illustrate that in the context of infection, nsp1 mediates its function by both induction of cellular mRNA degradation and inhibition of translation, these functions are linked and it is likely that both are major contributors to SARS-CoV-2 virulence. In conclusion, our study provides an in-depth picture of how nsp1 interferes with cellular gene expression, and reveals the critical role it plays in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis specifically through shutoff of the IFN response.",

Next, reads were aligned to a reference containing human rRNA and tRNA, and all reads that were successfully aligned were filtered out, and the remaining reads were aligned to the hg19 and to the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Genebank NC_045512.2). Alignment was performed using Bowtie v.1.1.229 with a maximum of two mismatches per read. Reads that were not aligned to the genome were aligned to the transcriptome (using the known canonical isoform UCSC gene annotations) and to SARS-CoV-2 junctions that were recently annotated (Kim et al., 2020) . The aligned position on the genome was determined as the 5\u2032 position of RNA-seq reads, and for ribosome profiling reads the p-site of the ribosome was calculated according to read length using the offset from the 5\u2032 end of the reads that was calculated from canonical cellular ORFs. The offsets used were +12 for reads that were 28 or 29 bp and +13 for reads that were 30-33 bp. Footprint reads that were of other lengths were discarded.

For analysis in which host and viral gene expression were compared ( Fig. 4  and extended data figure 7) , RPKM was normalized based on the number of reads uniquely aligned to the coding regions of both the host and the virus. For analysis that was focused on cellular gene expression, the RPKM was normalized based on the number of reads aligned to the rRNA and tRNA. This number was estimated by using the ratio of rRNA and tRNA reads to cellular aligned reads in a total RNA sequencing (without polyA selection). For footprint libraries, read coverage of cellular and viral genes was normalized to RPKM based on the number of reads aligned uniquely to the host total CDS aligned ribosome profiling host reads. Because the viral subgenomic transcripts are widely overlapping, RNA-seq RPKM levels of viral genes were computed with deconvolution as was previously described (Irigoyen et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2020) . First, from the RPKM values of each subgenomic transcript, the RPKM of the upstream subgenomic (or the RPKM of ORF1b for the first subgenomic) transcript was subtracted. Then, for subgenomic transcripts, leader-body junctions were quantified on the basis of the number of uniquely mapped reads that span each canonical junction using STAR 2.5.3a aligner (Dobin et al., 2013) . Finally, on the basis of the correlation between the deconvoluted RPKM and junction abundance of the subgenomic RNAs, the RPKM levels of all viral RNAs (including the genomic RNA) were estimated. Viral and host gene translation efficiency was calculated as the ratio between footprint RPKM and RNA-Seq RPKM. For cellular gene quantification, the number of reads aligned to the CDS of each gene in each replicate had to be greater than 10 reads.",

Genes with an intronic to exonic ratio of >1 were excluded from the analysis. Statistical significance (Fig. 5h ) was tested using a paired t-test on the log values of the percentage.",

First, reads were aligned to a reference containing human rRNA and tRNA, and all reads that were successfully aligned were filtered out. The remaining reads were aligned to a reference of the human and the virus as described above. Reads mapped to the virus were discarded and reads mapped to the human were used in the next steps. Output.bam files from STAR were used as input for the GRAND-SLAM analysis (J\u00fcrges et al., 2018) with default parameters and with trimming of 5 nucleotides in the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032ends of each read. Infected and uninfected samples were analyzed in separate runs. Each one of the runs also included an unlabeled sample (no 4sU) that was used for estimating the linear model of the background mutations. The output of GRAND-SLAM, i.e., the estimated ratio of newly synthesized out of total molecules for each gene (new to total ratio (NTR)), was used to calculate the half-life as described below. The old transcript fraction for each gene in each sample is 1 -NTR; this number reflects the pre-existing mRNA molecules (not labelled) and these values were used for half-life estimation of cellular genes. The half-life of each gene was calculated by linear regression of the log values of the calculated old transcript fraction. Estimated variance of the values as calculated by GRAND-SLAM were used as weights in the linear regression. The regression coefficient \u03bb was converted to half-life as \u2212log(2)/\u03bb. For further analysis, only genes for which the P value in the regression was < 0.1 and the adjusted r2 > 0.7 were used.",
