The call to make health sciences research more reproducible and reusable has spearheaded a number of initiatives in the United States (1,2), Europe (3, 4) , and Canada (5) to improve data discoverability, accessibility, and transparency. The importance of data sharing in the health sciences has been well documented. Sharing research data improves the findability and availability of research outputs, which can spearhead new research discoveries (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) ; encourages transparency and holds the research community accountable (12) (13) (14) ; and improves the interoperability of data across research communities and systems (15) (16) (17) .",

Although these efforts aim to make datasets more discoverable, valuable data shared alongside publications, in external discipline-specific repositories, via websites, or by request, are difficult to locate, access, and reuse.

The call to make health sciences research more reproducible and reusable has spearheaded a number of initiatives in the United States (1,2), Europe (3, 4) , and Canada (5) to improve data discoverability, accessibility, and transparency. The importance of data sharing in the health sciences has been well documented. Sharing research data improves the findability and availability of research outputs, which can spearhead new research discoveries (6-11); encourages transparency and holds the research community accountable (12) (13) (14) ; and improves the interoperability of data across research communities and systems (15) (16) (17) .",

Data availability statements contain the authors' description of where and how to gain access to the research data underlying the published manuscript. Additional publications were identified using PubMed's data filter, which indicates when data have been shared in a data repository.

The absence of metadata elaborating on application requirements calls into question the true availability of these data, and impedes future research based upon them. The challenges of requesting access to data in the health sciences have been studied elsewhere in relation to the inadequate transparency and standardization of data use agreements (33, 36, 37) . Because data available by request or application are often collected from human participants, improving the discoverability of and access to these sensitive data will help prevent unnecessary study replication, create opportunities for pooling related data, and increase research efficiency to accelerate new discoveries (33, 34, 36, 37) . Our findings indicate that current practices in CIHRfunded data sharing lack the standardization and transparency necessary to secure these outcomes.",

Descriptive documentation for data such as codebooks and data dictionaries, and actionable supporting files such as code and software, are increasingly recognized as necessary components of human-and machine-readable research data (27, 30, 38) , and our results indicate that CIHR-funded research data sharing practices can vastly improve in this area.",

It is remarkable that over 70% of publications that shared data did not incorporate sufficient metadata or documentation to facilitate discovery, access, and reuse. Without policies and standards in place that anticipate the upcoming Tri-Agency data management policy, and enhanced support for researchers seeking to implement best practices in data management and sharing, the majority of publicly funded research data will remain hidden, inaccessible, and unusable. For CIHR-funded data in particular, transparent metadata and reporting guidelines for sensitive data will be essential for improving data discoverability and accessibility across the health sciences.",
