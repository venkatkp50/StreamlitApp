            "text": "The COVID-19 respiratory syndrome, associated with the novel strand of Coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2, has had a massive impact worldwide. Initially found in Wuhan, in the heart of Hubei Province, China, 1 it has quickly spread since last December to almost every country in the world, with the most affected being the US, Spain, UK, Italy, France, Germany, Russia, Turkey, Iran, and China. This has caused severe consequences and a large number of deaths, mostly due to the ease of transmission, i.e. the virality, of this disease. For an infectious disease outbreak such as the one caused by COVID-19, predictive mathematical models play an important role for the planning of effective control strategies. Among the models formulated over the years, 2, 3 the susceptible-infected-recovered model (SIR) is possibly one of the most used epidemiological models: the population is split into three stages of infection, sometimes called compartments, thus the terminology compartmental models, as reported in an early work by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927 . 4 A variant of these classic compartmental models used to tackle the specific features of SARS can be found in the work of Gumel et al. 5 and similar equations can be found in the framework developed for the HIV transmission in heterogeneous populations. 6 Several aspects of this virus have been investigated: some research assessed the effectiveness of different response strategies, 7 other authors focused on modelling the various stages of the disease and the death rate, as done in a seminal work by Giordano et al. 8 Early research in China showed unique epidemiological traits of the COVID-19 virus, 9 most notably the fact that a large portion of transmissions were caused by asymptomatic individuals, whether they were showing mild or no symptoms at all. Indeed, further research demonstrated that asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals have the same viral load and thus the same capability to further spread the virus, 10 and the work of Rothe et al. for a case of transmission from an asymptomatic individual in Germany. 11 In the context of data driven models, Bertozzi et al. find a relation between branching point processes and classical compartmental models such as susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) and susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR), whilst fitting the models with data from a variety of countries, including China, Italy, Japan, and other countries. 12 A study that investigates whether daily test reports can help authorities to control the epidemic, 13 discusses how mitigation strategies can fail when modelled because of various factors, such as delay, unstable dynamics, and uncertainty in the feedback loop. For the Italian situation, the work of Della Rossa et al. provides interesting insight on the need to coordinate the efforts in controlling the situations in an inter-regional setting, and highlights the need of such coordination by means of a network model. 14 In the work of Yilmaz et al., the authors discuss how to identify and analyze bridges between communities in graphs with the purpose to understand how to track and where to start tests on which individuals. 15 Another study includes a particle-based mean field model that investigates the pros and cons of social distancing through an approach that compares individuals to molecules in a solution. 16 A very early model of this disease was given in the work by Calafiore et al., where the novelty lies in including a proportionality factor in a standard SIR model to account for hidden infections. 17 In a model on the case for the UK, the authors account for four main elements and a finer level of detail for each of them in assessing the impact of the speed in which the immunity is lost. 18 A risk sensitivity analysis on the economic impact of the disease where the optimising behaviour of agents to influence future transitions is considered by the work by Garibaldi et al. 19 The work of Pastor-Satorras provides a survey of the literature on complex networks for epidemic processes 20 , and applications of complex networks to epidemic processes in evolutionary dynamics can be found in the work by Tan et al. 21",

            "text": "Evidence before this study Italy has been the first European country to face the challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic. Predictive mathematical models are a useful tool to understand the proportion of this pandemic and consider different control measures, but few have considered the impact of asymptomatic in a structured setting, where the structure is captured by complex networks. Our search spanned from medical journals from PubMed in general and specific sources in control and data driven modelling until August 31, 2020, using the terms \"control\" and \"data driven modelling\", without date or language restrictions. As for the databases, we used the official data from the Italian Ministry of Health and the Istat seroprevalence study. Seroprevalence studies are recent in many European countries and many works considered them in modelling the evolution of SARS-CoV-2. The impact of asymptomatic infected must be understood to prevent a second wave of this virus. Added value of this study This is one of the first studies that uses data from the Istat seroprevalence analysis to model the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 at national and regional levels in Italy with emphasis on modelling the interactions between susceptible individuals and asymptomatic infected. Our study proposes a predictive model, inspired by classical epidemiological models, that emphasises the impact of asymptomatic infected in spreading the disease through a measure of the interactions in the population. This study analyses the possible scenarios following the return to schools in mid-September by capturing the heterogeneity in the population by means of complex networks, graphs that mimic real features present in biological, computer and social networks. Finally, our case study for the Italian case confirms that only a coordinated policy at national and regional levels can be effective in controlling the virus in the forthcoming months. Implications of all the available evidence Our study can serve as a reference to study the situation in other contexts and countries, suggesting similar outcomes for a multi-national approach in the European case or in the US. Because of the present difficulty to reach herd immunity without counting a large number of deaths due to the inability of health systems to face the speed in which this disease spreads, our results suggest, in line with previous evidence and data driven models, that the only way to monitor this disease is through coordinated action and monitoring of the asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic infected.",

The peculiarity of a compartmental model is that the population is divided into a discrete set of states and individuals can only exist in these states: for instance, in the SIR model, individuals can be susceptible to the virus (healthy), contract the virus and thus be infected, and finally be immune to the virus when they recover. This model accounts for those diseases that do provide long term immunity to future infections from the same virus through the presence of antibodies in the host organism. We named our model SAIR, because of the state variables we chose to include: Susceptible, Asymptomatic infected, symptomatic Infected and Removed. We choose to use the term removed in place of the more common recovered because we do not discriminate between individuals who recover from the disease and individuals who passed away. The term removed is also used commonly in the literature, and in important contributions in the field. 22 As previously mentioned, our model is a variant of the susceptibleexposed-infected-recovered (SEIR), 23 but with notable differences:",

            "text": "In the first investigation, we use the official data to fit our model and estimate the parameters and then we compare our model to the value of the Istat seroprevalence study. We set the portion of the population in each stage as: A(0) = 94/(60 * 10 6 ), I(0) = 127/(60 * 10 6 ), R(0) = 0, and S(0) = 1 \u2212 A(0) \u2212 I(0) \u2212 R(0), where these values are taken from the data for the isolated at home and hospitalised infected. 27 The reason behind this choice is that we believe that people that are not hospitalised must either be asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic and thus would fall in our category of To have an initial estimate of the parameters, we used an implementation of a non-linear least squares regression, using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. 28 This is an iterative optimisation algorithm that fits a function to a desired output, obtaining the parameters that minimises the square error between the output of the function and the objective value given. In this specific case, the values that were fit were the number of symptomatic active cases and the number of removed. This algorithm is widely used because of its versatility and efficient use of data, even on small datasets. 29 However, it is very sensitive to the hyperparameters so an educated initial estimation of them was provided as well as the specific range of values that each parameter could take. These parameter values, which were analytically extracted, were used as a starting point, and were later adapted to better match the empirical results. Due to the similar viral load between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, 10 we set the values of \u03b3 and \u03bb to be very close. Parameterk 1 is chosen to be larger thank 2 at the start (and also in future time instants), because it accounts for the likelihood that people interact with asymptomatic individuals more likely than with infected that show symptoms. On March 6th, prime minister Giuseppe Conte imposed a set of localised lockdowns to isolate the outbreaks, and on March 9th a national quarantine was imposed, which restricted the movements of the population and therefore their contacts and interactions. We account for this by lowering the values ofk 1 andk 2 slowly over the days following the lockdown, down tok 1 = 0.2957 andk 2 = 0.0305 before the end of the quarantine period. Following the ease of the lockdown measures, we setk 1 = 0.3636 andk 2 = 0.0594 to account for the increased interactions during mid-August holidays. At the end of February and thus before the lockdown, we calculate R 0 = 4.98, in accordance with studies that place it between 2 and 5. 30, 31, 32, 33 Towards the end of the quarantine, the value of R 0 goes below 1 and then it oscillates around R 0 = 1.06 during August. As it can be seen in Fig. 8 , our model matches quite accurately the recovered and hospitalised infected, but it does not do the same with the asymptomatic infected. Even in that case, we can see from Fig. 9 that our estimation of the cumulative infected is higher that the confirmed cases. It is matching quite closely an early estimate of the undetected asymptomatic being around 30%, but far away from the current Istat estimate depicted in red. In accordance with Theorem 3, the ratio\u012a = 1.7041, which is the exact ratio between\u012a and\u0100. When using the work of B\u00f6hning et al. to estimate the hidden infection, we obtain almost identical values, namely a number of 264240 hidden infected. 34 This value would account for twice as many infected individuals as the number of detected infections, but it is underestimated if compared with seroprevalence studies. 24, 35 In the second investigation, we use the seroprevalence study to fit our model and estimate its parameters. We set the initial conditions as in the During the days following the local and national quarantine, we lower the values ofk 1 andk 2 to 0.1916 and 0.0478, respectively, and then we account for the increased connectivity during August by setting them tok 1 = 0.2738 and k 2 = 0.0971. The basic reproduction number is calculated as R 0 = 4.9432 at the beginning of the pandemic, and R 0 = 1.2490 at the end of August. As it can be seen in Fig. 10 , our model matches hospitalised infected very accurately, but it suggests a higher number of asymptomatic and removed to balance for matching the value of the seroprevalence study. As it is done in the previous case, we interpolate the value of the seroprevalence study by using an exponential regression as depicted in red in Fig. 11 . We chose the parameters such that our estimation of the cumulative infected, i.e. the purple dotted curve, matches the predicted infected from the seroprevalence study. In accordance with Theorem 3, the ratio is in this case\u012a = 0.2446, which corresponds to the ratio between\u012a and\u0100. We explicitly calculate the total number of people that have contracted the disease through our model by subtracting the confirmed deaths from the Removed state. We estimate a total of 8.48 * 10 5 individuals who contracted that disease and are currently healthy. Most of these individuals were undetected because of being asymptomatic.",

We set the general parameters of the model as , where each value is the portion of the whole population in Italy to the corresponding region ordered alphabetically, i.e. Abbruzzo for number 1, Basilicata for number 2 and so on. As in the previous case study, we gradually lower the values of \u03c8 1,k and \u03c8 2,k around the lockdown date and the following few days. Then, we fit our model with the data until August 29th, and then simulate what would happen in the event that schools open in mid-September. We start raising the connectivity values in correspondence of mid-late August, to account for the tourists coming to Italy and for the citizens returning from abroad. We increase these values further in correspondence to the opening of schools in mid-September. It is worth noting that the increase is proportional to the value of \u03c8 1,k and \u03c8 2,k , namely we increase these parameters of 1% of their actual value at time t, for each class of connectivity k.

It is interesting to note that delaying the start of schools in just one region has a marginal benefit without closing the interregional movements.

The issue with releasing the lockdown can be found in more interactions especially with people that do not show symptoms (modelled through \u03c8 1,k ).
