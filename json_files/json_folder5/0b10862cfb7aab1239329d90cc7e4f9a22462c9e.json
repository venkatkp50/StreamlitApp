Should we rely solely on randomized clinical trials (RCTs) because they are less prone to bias or should we push for more real-world evidence (RWE) because it might provide some of the information we really need to guide treatment decisions in routine care? The arguments have been aired extensively on both sides of a sometimes acrimonious debate. The controversy about the value of nonrandomized RWE was recently fanned by an insightful article by Collins et al., titled \"The Magic of Randomization vs. the Myth of Real-World Evidence\" 1 ; the authors make a well-justified case for modernizing and improving the feasibility of RCTs but also caution against the use of RWE.",

Twenty of 73 were designated orphan medicinal products, meaning that the prevalence of the target condition is < 5 of 10.000 in the European Union. An additional 8 were authorized for rare conditions but did not receive orphan status for a range of legal or regulatory reasons; hence, the total number of products for rare diseases is 28, that is close to 40% of all products containing a new active substance (for a complete list of products and characteristics, please see Table S1 ).",

It has been estimated that by 2025, 10-20 cell and gene therapy products will be approved each year. 4 The shift in the nature of products is relevant because it entails other secular trends for evidence generation. Most older drugs belonged to classes of compounds that are pharmacologically similar and intended for large groups of eligible patients; examples include statins, angiotensin receptor blockers, or proton pump inhibitors. With these compounds, the pharmacologic target of drug action and the drug-target interactions are essentially the same across most or all patients. Observed differences in clinical effect size across patient subpopulations can usually be explained by differences in down-stream pathologies or other between-patient differences external to the drug-target interaction per se. For example, the pharmacological drug targets for statins are the same across a number of subpopulations that can be defined by extra-pharmacological patient characteristics, such as primary prevention (a lower risk group) or secondary prevention (higher risk) groups. Consequently, it has been claimed that \"valid estimates of the absolute benefits and harms of a treatment can be obtained by applying reliable randomized evidence for its separate proportional effects on each outcome of interest to the absolute incidence of these outcomes in observational studies conducted within a particular population.\" 1 Where this assumption holds, results from RCTs may indeed be reasonably extrapolated across subpopulations (e.g., from higher risk to intermediate or even lower risk groups). 5, 6 Contrast this situation with the case of, for example, recently authorized treatments for cystic fibrosis (CF); patient heterogeneity is of a fundamentally different nature. CF is caused in all patients by a well-defined dysfunction in a single physiologic structure, a transmembrane chloride channel (CFTR). However, in each individual patient, the dysfunction itself is the result of one of > 2,000 different known mutations in the CFTR gene, which lead to defects in protein production, trafficking, function, misfolding, or premature degradation. 7 Drugs designed to modulate the CFTR product itself (rather than downstream common pathologies like infection or bronchial obstruction) are confronted with different drug targets across different subpopulations. The proteins encoded by some mutations are a better fit for a given molecule than those encoded by other mutations, and with some mutations there is no target protein present at all. It follows that the definition of a treatment population for the design of such drugs and for the generation of evidence about their effects (to be discussed below) must be mutation-specific, or at least specific to clusters of mutations. Extrapolation of efficacy information from one subpopulation to the next is therefore fundamentally different from a statin-type situation and will be quite impossible in some cases.",

            "text": "A very different example of drug-target heterogeneity is presented by cell therapies, which are autologous and thus patient-specific; no two patients receive identical treatments-a situation unheard of with nearly all 20th century treatments. Two autologous chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapies were approved in the past years in several regions for the treatment of defined hematologic malignancies. 8, 9 On-market experience shows that their clinical effectiveness is dependent not just on the clinical condition of the patient at the time of treatment but also, to no small extent, on the way the cells are harvested, prepared, and administered. 10, 11 The most extreme form of individualization of the drug-target interaction is now emerging with the development of therapies specifically designed for one single patient. We recently witnessed the development of an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapy (milasen) specifically designed to correct the mis-splicing of mRNA for a single patient with a very rare form of Batten's disease. The researchers emphasized that milasen \"is not suited to the treatment of other patients with Batten's disease because its design is customized to our patient's specific mutation.\" 12 To date, there is only a very small number of patients, including a person with idiopathic multicentric Castleman's disease, who identified a specific signaling pathway as a target in their own disease. Yet, these cases illustrate how recently developed technologies permit the delineation of pathways for truly individualized drug development. 13 ASOs are not the only therapeutic platform that lend themselves to the design of individualized treatments. Similarly, protein-based therapeutics (such as Fc-fusion proteins, antibody fragments, and antibody-drug conjugates), small interfering RNAs, or genetic constructs (e.g., for cell-based gene therapy) can be tailored to one individual patient's signaling or other disease pathway as a target in their own clinical condition. The hoped-for result of treatment personalization is not only improvement in effect size, compared with the blockbuster model, but also an expansion of the numbers and types of selectable targets. 7 Drugs designed for individual patients raise the fundamental question of our definition of the term \"drug.\" Consider a defined \"condition, \" like CLN7 Batten's disease, for which different pathogenic mutations are found in (nearly) each individual patient. Although all of them may receive an ASO with the same chemical backbone and sugar chemistry modifications, each ASO would be chemically different and patient-specific. Are we looking at one archetypal drug, or a drug class, or a multitude of different, individualized drugs? Similar considerations may apply to our definition of what is a \"clinical indication.\" For regulatory approval, it has been suggested that \"approvals as variations on a well-characterized archetypal product might be feasible if the interventions are closely related.\" 13 Although this might be a useful approach to regulatory approval of some families of individualized treatments, we will need to address the separate question of study designs for this growing number of 21st century treatments.",

            "text": "The obvious consequence of the shift from blockbuster to nichebuster drugs is a decrease in the size of the treatment-eligible population. 2 This is accompanied by a second, less apparent trend: statin-type drugs were prescribed by large numbers of (primary care) physicians. Novel drugs remain mostly in the hands of specialists, and, increasingly, are confined to use in tertiary care centers. Of the 73 drugs authorized in the European Union in 2018 and 2019, 59 (almost 81%) had some form of prescribing restrictions in their summary of product characteristics (see Table S1 ; e.g., \"Treatment should be under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia\"). Partly, this is due to the nature of the target population, such as patients with rare diseases, who are predominantly seen in specialized centers. However, many novel drugs, like cell or gene therapies, cancer treatments, and other non-small molecule drugs, also require intense immediate and follow up management. An example is the requirement for myeloablative conditioning before infusion of gene-modified human stem cells, which is associated with significant untoward effects. As a consequence, such treatments will mostly be confined to a small number of highly specialized centers, at least initially (some follow-up care might be shifted toward the primary care sector who therefore need to be adequately informed about treatment at the tertiary care facility). The shift in healthcare delivery has immediate consequences for our considerations of RCTs and RWE: in the future, specialized tertiary care facilities should be expected and held accountable to implement a high level of patient documentation that enables generation of high-quality real-world data, and ultimately the development of a \"learning health care system\" with the ability to provide increasingly robust assessments of drug effects over time. 15 Examples of using specialized centers for knowledge generation about novel drugs include the patient registry managed by the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, 16 and Cystic Fibrosis patient registries in Europe 17 and in the United States. 18 We touch upon another consequence of the changing nature of drugs for health care and public health. Collins et al. 1 observe that \"...the direction of drug development has changed in ways that may adversely affect public health. For example, in the past decade, the revenue from the 10 top-selling drugs in the United States increased by a factor of 2.5, but the patient population that those medications target decreased by a factor of 7.5 [...]. This trend [is] leading to a shift toward seeking treatments with larger effects in less common conditions that could be detected in smaller trials.\" We fully agree with the observation of the trend-which we have described in more detail above-and with the notion that the observed shift may have unwelcome economic consequences for healthcare systems. However, setting aside the economic aspects, we politely disagree with the conclusion that the long-term trend \"may adversely affect public health.\" It goes without saying that larger effects are preferable to incremental effect sizes, such as those of statins. Some but not all of the personalized treatments discussed above have shown impressive effect sizes that proved immediately life changing for patients. As to the diminishing target populations, we would argue that we are in the early stages of 21st century treatments. Broad application of sequencing technologies and other advances in basic sciences has uncovered the causes of a range of (rare) pathologies and has identified new mutations responsible for previously defined disorders with considerable knock-on effects for similar pathologies. As we learn to manipulate technology platforms 7 to develop personalized, or at least stratified, treatments at an increasing rate and speed, the circle of patients benefiting from such treatments will inevitably widen. The broadening of focus from statin-type drugs to include these novel therapies should be welcomed by patients, healthcare professionals, and the drug development community. The difficulty of conducting (large) RCTs of these therapies should not deter us from seeking to exploit their potential.",

Moreover, the disease did not lend itself to evidence generation by way of non-RCT methods because effect modifiers were poorly understood and construction of external control arms was not a viable option in light of the fast evolution in disease management, resulting in \"drift\" in clinical outcomes. 19 In this case, large well planned RCTs, ideally multi-arm platform trials were doable and seemed like the only useful way to generate robust evidence.

Different study types (symbolized by different colors) will be required to generate the information, given the appropriateness of methods for different research questions as well as practical constraints on evidence generation. Note that for some research questions, there will be no data and information available at all, at least at the time of market launch. See main text for real-life examples that fit the schematic.

            "text": "Finally, the need for additional sources of (non-RCT) evidence and better methods for evidence synthesis is coming to the fore in the increasingly common situation of detecting small effects in small target populations. It is easy to detect large effects, like cure or complete and durable disappearance of symptoms, either by way of randomized or even nonrandomized methods, but small effects are tricky to demonstrate. Yet, some beneficial drug effects may be described as small in terms of evidence generation but may still be relevant in the eyes of patients. Sufficiently large randomized trials, which could reliably assess such effects are not feasible, due to a scarcity of patients. On the other hand, nonrandomized real-world studies may be doable (e.g., by relying on external control groups from various sources), as discussed above. However, the potential biases can be appreciable, so the results often cannot be trusted when the benefits of a treatment are only moderate. 1 In this situation, all options available to decision makers look unattractive. Should strict evidence standards be maintained, potentially denying patients a relevant benefit \"because there is no robust evidence\"? Or should evidence standards be relaxed, giving patients the benefit of the doubt, but at the risk of doing more harm than good?",

We have discussed how, with 21st century drugs, the need for more explicit methods of evidence synthesis is becoming apparent but there is no ready-to-use methodology that would lend itself to the many facets of the evidence matrix ( Figure 1 ). It is tempting to speculate that advances in meta-analytical techniques, bioinformatics, causal inference, and artificial intelligence, building on artificial intelligence advances from other fields, can be harnessed to achieve the goal in a more explicit and systematic way in future. Similarly, regulators and other decision makers attempt to look at the \"totality of evidence.\" Yet, this is most often done by implicitly weighing strength and importance of evidence from different study types. Methods like multicriteria decision analysis would be particularly important for communicating regulatory (or Health Technology Assessment or payers) decisions about complex quality, nonclinical, and clinical data from multiple sources and with many uncertainties; such methods are available and have been explored in the drug regulatory and other contexts but there is more work to be done to establish their value and role. 28 ",
