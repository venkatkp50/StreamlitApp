India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh were the most COVID-19 affected countries in the South Asia region with 1695988, 278305, and 237661 confirmed cases, respectively. 6 Over the last few years, with availability and usage increased worldwide, the internet has become the main source of information particularly for healthcare-related concerns. 7, 8 With over 4.5 billion active internet users around the world, millions of people worldwide search online for health-related queries which make Web search queries a valuable source of public health infoveillance. 9, 10 Understanding about Web search trends can provide valuable information about public interest and awareness in health emergencies as a proxy for public health risk perception. 8, 11 Prior studies used internet search queries to model the outbreak of infectious disease (e.g., dengue, and influenza), track substance usages, and monitor public behavior. 12, 13 Subsequently, internet search queries also used to investigate public interest, health awareness, and mental health in the COVID-19 pandemic situation.
