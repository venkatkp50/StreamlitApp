In addition, malnutrition is a major public health concern affecting up to half of children under-five years in Ethiopia. However, evidence on the causal contribution of malnutrition to delay in child development is poorly understood in Ethiopia. Objective: To identify the relationship between different forms of malnutrition and delay in child development among children in Southwest Ethiopia. Methods: A community-based survey was conducted among 507 randomly selected mother-child pairs in the Guraghe Zone, Southwest Ethiopia. A pretested tool and validated anthropometric measurements were used. Anthropometric indices (WFH, WFA, and HFA) were calculated in Anthros software. The data were summarized in mean, median, standard deviation, tables and charts. Bivariable and multivariable binary logistic regression (stepwise backward regression) models were fitted with nutritional status (wasting, stunting and underweight) and other potential factors associated with delay in child developmental. Adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals and p-values were reported. Results: A total of 507 mother-child (12-59 months) pairs were included in the survey (97% response rate). The mean ASQ-3 score was 150 (\u00b1 23.4), with a minimum and maximum score of 45 and 270, respectively. A total of 149 (29.4%; 95% CI: 25.4-33.4) children had developmental delays, where 17.2%, 16.8%, 13.4%, 10.8%, and 10.1% had delays in gross motor, communication, problem-solving, personal-social, and fine motor skills, respectively. Children of working mothers (AOR=2.9; 1.8, 4.8), preterm births (AOR=3.2; 1.4, 7.0), early initiation of complementary feeding (AOR=2.5; 1.37, 4.6), stunting (AOR=3.0; 1.9, 4.7), underweight (AOR= 2.3; 1.1, 4.7) and low dietary diversity score (AOR=3.1; 1.3, 7.5), were predictors of developmental delay. Conclusion: Child development delay is a public health concern and it is strongly associated with stunting, underweight, undiversified dietary consumption, and suboptimal infant and young child feeding practices.",

            "text": "Childhood development refers to the multidimensional dynamic changes in a child's physical growth, social, emotional, thinking, and communication skills, which mainly occur during childhood and continue into early adulthood. 1, 2 It is a key aspect of the holistic changes that occur in early childhood. 3, 4 Childhood development encompasses five different domains, namely gross motor, fine motor, speech, cognitive, and socio-emotional skills, which are age specific tasks that most healthy children can do at a certain age. [1] [2] [3] [4] The period from birth to a few years of age is a very critical period, where critical developmental processes usually happen. 5 The majority of organ development, including the nervous system, happens up to five years of age. During the first five years of a child's life, more than 90% of the size of a child's brain has been reached, 6 making early childhood the most sensitive period for the occurrence of major developmental delays that affect a child's learning capability, emotional development, and negatively affect their future life. 3, 7, 8 Situations where more than one in 200 children are displaced, one in five stunted children, and 40% do not have access to school, internally displaced and stunted, aggravate the problem of delayed developmental milestones and might be a serious problem. 9, 10 More than 250 million children (43%) in low-income and middleincome countries have some sort of developmental delay, where the burden is highest in Sub Saharan Africa. 8 A recent estimate also showed 81.0 million children aged 3-4 years (49.2, 113.3) in low and middle income countries (LMICs), with the highest burden (29.5 million) in Sub-Saharan Africa, had low cognitive and/or socioemotional development. 11 Furthermore, it is estimated that more than 25% of children worldwide have developmental delays. 12 In Ethiopia, the prevailing poverty and food insecurity, hinder the children's full developmental potential. 13 Also, an estimated 59% of children are at risk of poor developmental delay in the country. 14 In addition, food insecurity and malnutrition are prevailing across the globe, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. In Ethiopia, more than 37% and 21% of children are victims of stunting and underweight, 15 which is aggravated by the rising price of goods and population displacement. Malnutrition contributes to more than half (53%) of childhood morbidity and mortality, and costs an estimated 16.5% of the national gross domestic product. 16 The consequences of malnutrition go beyond predisposing to short-term morbidity and mortality, increasing the risks of cognitive and emotional consequences. [17] [18] [19] [20] Yet, millions of children fall short of their full developmental potential due to improper care, nutrition, social care, poor care during pregnancy, and other important factors. Nurturing care for better childhood development is crucial for optimal health and development of children. 10, 21 However, among the potential causes, some are preventable or treatable, while the others are nonmodifiable factors. 22 Better comprehensive health care in the first three years of age is a crucial window opportunity where a significant number of children are affected by illness, malnutrition, and other major health problems. 23, 24 Evidence shows that developmental delay is a multifactorial and multifaceted problem. 25 There is a lack of clear evidence quantifying the relative contribution of nutritional status to delay in child development. 8 A study showed that stunting is not a significant factor associated with the risk of developmental delay (AOR=1.36; 0.85, 2.15) or low development (AOR=0.92; 0.48, 1.78). 26 Other studies have found that cognitive stimulation, 29 stunting, 30 iodine deficiency, 31 and irondeficiency anemia are key risk factors for developmental delay and may play a role in preventing it. [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] However, nutritional insults in the early childhood period significantly affect the cognitive potential of a child, as evidenced by the finding that for every 1 cm increase in the height of the child, improvement in child cognitive performance was observed (0.22-0.24 SD). 37 Sudfeld also indicated that stunting is associated with poor communication, motor, and cognitive performance. However, the relationship with wasting (WFH Z score) was not linear and not direct. 38 Despite previous literature showing that a high risk of developmental delay is associated with stunting and socioeconomic class, 32, 37, 38 there is a paucity of literature linking malnutrition (both acute and chronic malnutrition) with milder forms of developmental delay in Ethiopia, which needs to be supported by concrete evidence. In addition, there is a scarcity of research in the country and the tool to assess developmental delay is not comprehensive enough to capture the full aspects of childhood development. Thus, this study is aimed at understanding the developmental status of children and quantifying the relative contributions of different forms of malnutrition on childhood development.",

A portable stadiometer was used to measure older children (above two years) and a calibrated length board was used for younger children (less than two years), whose body parts are in touch with the measuring board in proper anatomical position. The weight was measured with minimal clothing and without shoes to the nearest 0.1 kg. The child's body at the occiput, shoulder blades, buttocks, and heels were in touch with the board and recorded to the nearest 0.1 cm. In addition, the 8-item minimum dietary diversity for children prepared and validated by the Food and Nutrition technical Assistant of the food and FANTA project was used. The consumption of foods from each food group was collected using the past 24-hour recall period under standard procedures for recalling food consumed. The seven food groups used for tabulation of this indicator are: grains, roots, and tubers; legumes and nuts; dairy products (milk, yogurt, and cheese); flesh foods (meat, fish, poultry, and liver/organ meats); eggs; vitamin A-rich fruits and vegetables; and other fruits and vegetables. 45 ",

A substantial proportion of children (29.4%; 95% CI: 25.4%, 33.4%) had some kind of developmental delay. Other survey reports from rural China (35.7%) 49 and Nigeria (35.4%) also indicated that developmental delay is a common problem among children. 50 These studies used the contextualized ASQ-3 tool, and the factors leading to poor developmental potential might be common in these countries. While the current estimate is far below the national estimate (59%), 14 it was higher than reports from studies conducted in Wolaita Sodo, South Ethiopia (19%), 51 Turkey (6.5%), 52 India (16.2%), 53 and Burdwan district, West Bengal (7.9%). 54 In addition, the current estimate is below the regional estimate (43%) in low-and middle-income countries. Overall, the burden of developmental delay is a major public health concern in Ethiopia. This lower prevalence might be due to the fact that this study is community-based and was conducted among healthy children. While some other studies were conducted in hospital settings, where the problem is expected to rise among malnourished and ill children. The World Bank estimates that children of today have only reached 56% of their full growth potential, ultimately affecting economic productivity and health. In addition, in settings where more than 60% of children do not have proper nurturing child care, 6 the burden of delayed developmental delay is of great public health concern. It should be a government concern and contribute in large proportion to maintaining the quality of life and productivity of a country.",

            "text": "In this study, we found that children from working mothers are at higher risk of developmental delay which might be related to various factors. Having a nurturing parental caring practice better predicts optimal developmental parameters. 10, 24, 36 Other studies conducted in Bengal and India indicate similar results. It is also pointed out that children of working mothers (AOR=1.8, p-value < 0.05) had a two-fold increased risk of developmental delay. 36 This is particularly evidenced by mothers who stay outside the home, usually deprive the time for nurturing child care. In addition, children may not get proper infant and young child feeding (breast feeding), which allows adequate nourishment, which is critical to maintain optimum nutritional status and emotional developments. 35, 55 Increasing the time spent with children improves the emotional and psychological relationship between mother and child for better developmental milestones. Furthermore, developmental delays have become more prevalent among children of mothers with low socioeconomic status and 36 In addition, it should be noted that environmental exposure to toxins in contaminated could potentially affect the nutritional status of children and could result in delayed child development. 56 A study also showed that the rate of aflatoxin exposure was higher among stunted than nonstunted (51% vs 41%). 57 Preterm birth is one of the most important causes of poor developmental milestones. Any environmental exposure to poor nutrition and other adverse exposures leads to preterm birth and intrauterine growth retardation. This ultimately limits the newborn's neuronal development, brain size, and nerve myelination. A prospective study showed that preterm births had worse cognitive (MD= \u22125.3; \u22128.2, \u22122.4), language (MD=\u221211.4; \u221215.3, \u22127.5), and motor development (MD=\u22127.3; \u221210.6 to \u22123.9) at the age of 2 years. In addition, the risk of developmental delay was also significantly higher among those born preterm. 58 Furthermore, the dietary practices (dietary diversity and complementary feeding) and nutritional status of children were major predictors of developmental delay. The whole continuum of malnutrition, starting from poor nutrition in intrauterine life, poor infant feeding practice and inadequate dietary intakes, results in poor growth, development, and its long-term consequences. 59 However, the proportion of children getting a diversified diet and the minimum acceptable diet is quite low. 60,61 Furthermore, stunting is common, affecting 37% of under-five children, 15 with serious consequences for individuals, communities, and the country. 62 One study showed that stunted children scored 16.1% and 48% less on vocabulary tests and quantitative assessment tests. 34 However, it should be noted that developmental delay be a sign of social disadvantage and may not be totally attributable to malnutrition (stunting). 27, 28 Evidence showed that stunting is not a significant factor associated with the risk of developmental delay (AOR=1.36; 0.85, 2.15) or low development (AOR=0.92; 0.48, 1.78). 26 This might opt to search for potential underlying causes of developmental delay related to aflatoxin exposure, social disadvantage and other potentially interacting factors hindering children development. 27, 28 Multipronged stunting prevention strategies, such as ensuring food security, improving caregiver knowledge and understanding, and providing proper health care, should be strengthened to ensure long-term achievement of optimal child development. Hence, holistic nurturing care covering the nutritional, social, and psychological aspects of children's lives is critical to halting the bad cycle of poverty, malnutrition, and economic development. 4 The first 1000 days of life are a golden opportunity, and all proper feeding practices should be strengthened. 33 This study pointed out that the burden of developmental delay can be surveyed using the ASQ-3 tool, which considers age specific activities that a child should do. The tool is an exhaustive measure, measuring the five major dimensions of childhood developmental milestones. 39, 40, 42 Our study, the national estimate, 14 and evidence from southwest Ethiopia, 51 indicate that developmental delays are a major concern in Ethiopia. It should be noticed that the problem is multifaceted, despite the fact that poverty, malnutrition, and poor dietary practices have a great contribution to poor childhood development. Context specific interventional studies testing effective and feasible interventions to address these multifaceted causes will be of paramount importance in Ethiopia.",

Maternal occupation, dietary diversity, infant feeding practices, stunting, and underweight were significant predictors of the risk of childhood developmental delay. Nutritional care, and ultimately maintaining children's nutritional status, is the foundation for preventing developmental delay. Multipronged nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive interventions should be strengthened, particularly in rural poor communities. Creating a comfortable work environment for mothers who have children at work is crucial to promoting IYCF and nurturing care for optimal development.",
