Understanding those factors influencing preventive behavior is the first step in preventing the spread of the disease. This study investigates factors affecting youth intention and preventive behaviors in the face of COVID-19 through the health belief model by using a cross-sectional survey collected through an online questionnaire. The sample comprises 304 rural youth in South Iran who were selected through a random sampling technique. The results reveal that perceived severity, perceived benefits, public health beliefs, perceived self-efficacy, and the cue to act positively and significantly affect preventive behaviors. The model explains 59% of variance changes in rural youth preventive behaviors during COVID-19. Cue to action is the strongest and self-efficacy was the weakest determinant of youth's preventive behavior. This study confirms that the HBM framework has appropriate predictive power and is an effective tool for investigating preventive behaviors during COVID-19. These results provide important policy implications for the development of policies that aim to avoid the further spread of COVID-19 between young citizens.",

Existing research shows that the rapid spread of COVID-19 is strongly associated with the displacement of people with no-to-mild symptoms; i.e., those who are unaware they are infected (7) . Therefore, non-medical practices, such as promoting protective behaviors like staying at home (home quarantine and reducing human interactions), increasing social distance, avoiding travels, and following personal hygiene tips (washing hands regularly and using masks when going to public places and crowded places) (8, 9) , are used to control the spread of the disease (10) . Promoting these preventive behaviors is essential for slowing the spread of COVID-19 (11, 12) .",

Monitoring people's perceptions and behavioral responses to COVID-19 is necessary to improve health risk communications and achieve successful changes in people's behaviors. However, globally, there is little information about people's perceptions and preventive behaviors regarding Protective measures to prevent the transmission of the disease largely depend on rapid changes in the behavior of communities, thus relying on the ability of individuals to understand the risks associated with the virus and adapt their behaviors accordingly (13) . For example, Wise et al. (13) show that understanding higher personal risk predicts preventive behaviors like hand washing and social distance. Akter (6) show that people who perceive a threat from COVID-19 collect medical and cleaning equipment, while those who do not take the disease seriously are careless, for example, moving around freely, traveling, gathering together, and not engaging in any preventive behaviors.",

Facing high unemployment rates, not only do rural youth have very little financial strength and income, but they also lack health insurance coverage and other social supports (20) . Young villagers are vital stakeholders because they are in direct contact with food resources in supply chains. Their travel to urban areas and remaining there is in opposition to health advice and can increase the spread of the disease. For this reason, the protection of this group and the encouragement of healthy behaviors within it are of major importance. The study of health protection measures in Iran is important because it was the first low-or middle-income country to suffer a major outbreak including rural areas and learning from Iran's experience will help all low-and middle-income countries (22) . Certainly in developing countries, including Iran, the shock of COVID-19 will be much more severe because most farmers in rural areas in these countries are not just prone to poverty and extreme vulnerability but they also have limited access to formal mechanisms to deal with these shocks (23) .",

This research seeks to answer this question among rural youth in Bushehr province of southern Iran. Iran and its southern region are chosen because of its severe experience with COVID-19 (5, 17, 24, 25) . According to statistics, as of August 10, 2021, COVID-19 has resulted in 94,603 deaths in Iran, with numbers continuing to increase (26) . The existing literature shows that various factors affect the preventive behavior of people with respect to infectious diseases. Further, the behaviors of people in potentially high-risk groups can play an important role in preventing and controlling infectious diseases (27) . Thus, it is important to examine why some people, especially rural youth, participate in the prevention, screening, and control of health behaviors regarding COVID-19, while others do not. However, little information exists on the reasons for the participation or non-participation of rural youth in Iran with respect to preventive behaviors for COVID-19 and the evaluation of the factors affecting this behavior.",

Studies use various theories and models to investigate the factors influencing preventive behaviors for various diseases, including COVID-19. For example, the health belief model to predict the use of personal protective equipment in SARS outbreaks (28) , unified theory of acceptance and use of technology to predict the willingness to wear a mask (29), the theory of protection motivation against COVID-19 (22, 30) , as well as knowledge, attitudes, and practices theory to investigate preventive behaviors against . In this regard, Mukhtar (31) recommends using the Health Beliefs Model (HBM) for recognizing preventive behaviors during the COVID-19. Since, HBM is one of the most functional theories related to behavioral change and preventive health behaviors (32) , this theory is used in this study.",

HBM assumes that safe actions originate from two main mechanisms: One's attitude toward danger (threat perception) and individual assessment of preventive behavior (behavioral evaluation). Perception of threat includes two sub-components or social psychological beliefs: perceived susceptibility (PSU) and perceived severity (PSE). The behavioral assessment comprises two sub-components of perceived benefits (PBE) and perceived barriers (PBR) (38, 39) . PSU means people's beliefs regarding the probability of getting an illness (32) . PSE means the belief that a severe health problem can lead to death or other serious consequences (40) (41) (42) . The PBE refers to a person's assessment of the worth or effectiveness of performing health-oriented behaviors to reduce the risk of disease (37) . Perceived barriers refer to a person's estimation of challenges to behavior change (43) . HBM assumes that people engage in preventative behaviors if they (i) believe that they are more likely to get a disease (perceived susceptibility); (ii) understand the depth of the risk and its severity (perceived severity); (iii) perceive the benefits by adopting preventive health behaviors; and (iv) recognize that there is an imperfect obstacle to the implementation of preventive behaviors (44, 45) (see Figure 1 ).",

This result is constant with the existing literature (44, 45, 56, 57) . Perceived self-efficacy is another predictor of protective behaviors (Hypothesis H5). Self-efficacy is an individual's belief in his or her capability to change performance (47) ; here, the extent to which a person feels that he or she can apply protective methods. If a person believes in their ability to access and use protective equipment, they are likely to engage in protective behavior. This result is consistent with previous studies (22, 44, 45, 57, 59) . The cue to action is the most important predictor of people's protective behavior (hypothesis H6). Cue to action is a stimulus that motivates people to take action to prevent the transmission of the disease. These stimuli can be clips or news about the death of people due to COVID-19 or the effects and consequences of this disease on the lives of people, whether via mass media or social networks (6) . Seeing or hearing about any of these (cues to action) can encourage people to take protective measures. These findings are consistent with previous studies (56, 57, 60) . The present study provides evidence of the effectiveness of public health beliefs in performing preventive behaviors (Hypothesis H7). Public health beliefs refer to a person's values, beliefs, concerns, and readiness for health issues in daily activities. People who are aware of health issues and choose a wellness-oriented routine are more likely to engage in preventative actions than people who are unaware of health issues (61) . In this study, young people who have a higher level of awareness about health measures and their impact on health are more likely to engage in preventive behaviors. The effect of PSU and PBR are not significant in the preventive behaviors of rural youth (Hypothesis H2, H4 ).",

Given the vital role of perceived benefits in implementing preventive behavior, the extension efforts should highlight the benefits of preventive behavior, such as protecting not just their own lives but also their loved ones. To improve the efficacy of prevention efforts, extension experts and health officials need to strengthen public health beliefs regarding COVID-19 through information and awareness campaigns that use publicity and educational materials on preventive activities. Finally, we believe that COVID-19 will create a new role for agricultural extension services in developing countries like Iran. Most variables affecting preventive behavior are triggered by education and awareness; thus, training and awareness about the depth of risk and seriousness of the disease, public health beliefs, stimulants (cues/trigger), and the benefits of preventive behaviors along with the ability of young people to perform these actions are fundamental and necessary. As extension agents have been working in rural areas for years, educating and working with villagers, the simplest and cheapest way to achieve broad outreach in rural areas is to equip extension agents with the materials needed to teach villagers how to deal with COVID-19.",

Understanding behavioral differences is crucial for better targeting education, campaigns, and policies toward different groups. Only if the needs of different groups are properly accounted for will adoption rates be enhanced and the spread of diseases such as COVID-19 limited. In addition, people's perceptions are very influential in a rapid change in their behavior toward COVID-19. This study investigates the factors affecting the preventive behavior of rural youth in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic using HBM. The results using structural equations show good explanatory power for self-reported behavior. The HBM model predicts 59% of the variance of preventive behavior against COVID-19 outbreaks, such as wearing gloves and masks, regular hand washing, and regular hand disinfection. All of HBM's independent constructs, except perceived susceptibility and perceived barriers affect preventive behavior. The results show that cue to action is the strongest predictor of behavior.",

This study is a cross-sectional study and its data was collected in August 2020 in Iran, so caution should be exercised in generalizing the results to other regions and times. Another potential limitation of this study was that the questionnaire was online and as a result, the respondents were the only people who had access to the Internet. While not all villagers have high access to the Internet. Therefore, it is possible that some villagers are less likely to participate in data collection. Another limitation is that behaviors are self-reported. The selfreport does not allow the assessment of actual behavior (35) . It is suggested that in future studies, the actual behaviors of individuals be examined. In addition, the paradigm of this study is quantitative. It is suggested that combined quantitativequalitative methods be used in future studies to obtain more accurate results.",
