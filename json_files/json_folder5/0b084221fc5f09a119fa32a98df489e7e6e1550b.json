This capability makes it especially interesting for healthcare applications where patient and data privacy is of utmost concern. However, recent works on the inversion of deep neural networks from model gradients raised concerns about the security of FL in preventing the leakage of training data. In this work, we show that these attacks presented in the literature are impractical in real FL use-cases and provide a new baseline attack that works for more realistic scenarios where the clients' training involves updating the Batch Normalization (BN) statistics. Furthermore, we present new ways to measure and visualize potential data leakage in FL. Our work is a step towards establishing reproducible methods of measuring data leakage in FL and could help determine the optimal tradeoffs between privacy-preserving techniques, such as differential privacy, and model accuracy based on quantifiable metrics.",

This is in contrast to the \"cross-device\" setting with many hundreds or thousands of clients, each with relatively small amounts of data, local compute resources, and unreliable network connections which might be dropping in and out at any time during training. In healthcare, there are different ways the data could be organized across institutes. In the so-called \"horizontal\" FL, each institute has data from different patients who share common attributes for a certain modeling task. On the other hand, \"vertical\" FL allows institutes which share a common set of patients but with different attributes to collaborate. For instance, bloodwork results and imaging data of the same patients could be possessed by two different participating institutes [17] but used to build a common AI model.",

This procedure is continued until the model converges. It is easy to see that this FL setting is equivalent to the well-known federated averaging (Fe-dAvg) algorithm [2] . Although the raw training data is never shared in FL, there is a concern that the shared model updates between the server and clients may still leak some training data [13] . While the server receives model updates from each client, a client computes model updates from the global models, consisting of updates from all clients, in different rounds of FL. We focus on the server-side gradient inversion attacks and investigate their applicability to FL in medical image classification scenarios. However, we note that the client-side gradient inversion could be treated in the same way but would involve the aggregation of more gradients from other clients.",

Unlike previous efforts in this area [13] , [15] which assume fixed Batch Normalization (BN) [18] statistics (i.e., evaluation mode), our work is the first to utilize model updates (i.e., gradients) that are generated by updating BN statistics during training, commonly known as \"training mode\" in frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow. Therefore, our work is directly applicable to real FL use-cases where BN is often used. Specifically, we propose a novel gradient inversion algorithm for estimating the running statistics of BN layers (i.e., running mean and variance) to Fig. 1 : The server-side gradient inversion attack scenario in FL. In a typical FL setup for healthcare applications, K participating sites (often hospitals or research institutions) keep their data locally while training a common global model. This model is distributed by a centralized federated server to initialize the current round t of local training at each site. After the local training is completed, all sites or a subset of the sites send model updates \u2206W with respect to the global model to the server, which aggregates them by performing a weighted average. The server then uses the aggregate to update the global model for the next round of FL (t+1). This iterative procedure continues until convergence of the models. Here, n k and n stand for the number of images at client k and the total number of images across clients, respectively. To study the gradient inversion attack, we assume an \"honest but curious\" [16] scenario where the server performs the FL computations faithfully but could be compromised by a potential malicious actor who could gain access to the training configurations and model updates from the participating sites and attempt an inversion attack (see Section II). match the gradient updates, and as a result, extract prior knowledge from intermediate feature distributions.",

            "text": "Our work is inspired by recent advances in gradient inversion of deep neural networks, which also raised concerns about privacy in FL [13] , and especially for healthcare applications [15] . One of the earliest works on this topic was Deep Gradient Leakage (DLG) [19] , which only relied on the information of shared gradients for their inversion attack. The main idea of their proposed algorithm is to match the gradients from synthesized and real data. However, this approach has several drawbacks which limit its use in practical FL scenarios. First, it only works for low-resolution images (32\u00d732 or 64\u00d764). Second, it needs a second order optimizer (e.g., L-BFGS) for the reconstruction algorithm. Such an optimizer is computationally expensive and cannot be easily applied to scenarios with high-resolution images or larger batch sizes. The work by Geiping et al. [13] attempts to address these issues and aligns itself with a more practical FL scenario by proposing a cosine similarity loss function to match the synthesized and ground truth gradients. This work uses first-order based optimizers such as Adam to make it more suitable for high resolution images and larger batch sizes. Geiping et al. [13] showed also that high-resolution images could be reconstructed from model updates sent in FL from small batch sizes, with access to the model gradients for one training iteration. Most recently, Yin et al. [14] further improved the image fidelity and visual realism of gradient inverted reconstructions by matching fixed running statistics of BN layers. To effectively localize objects in the training images, they use different optimization seeds to simultaneously reconstruct several images that can be registered to a consensus image from all recovered images. Kaissis et al. [15] applied the framework of Geiping et al. [13] to medical image classification scenarios and analyzed its applicability to reconstructing training images from FL clients. However, in their analysis, clients were trained only in the evaluation mode without updating the BN statistics, which is uncommon in modern deep learning [20] , [21] .",

However, in practical FL scenarios, such statistics vary inevitably when multiple batches are jointly used by a client within one training epoch for the weight update computation. As the gradient inversion problem is a second-order optimization by nature that relies on a static underlying forward pass, any shifts in BN statistics can result in accumulated errors across batches and baffle the efficacy of prior attacks, as we show later. By carefully tracing the momentum mechanism behind BN updates, this work demonstrates the first successful attempt of gradient inversion in a multi-batch scenario with updated BN statistics as in real-world FL applications. In addition, a comprehensive analysis is provided as guidance to enhance FL security against gradient inversion attacks. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to show how a gradient inversion attack might be successful when clients are sending model updates while updating their BN statistics, as commonly done in real-world FL scenarios.",

Since the gradient inversion is formulated as a second-order optimization task, accumulation of error due to discrepancies in the estimation of BN statistics leads to sub-optimal solutions. As a result, matching the gradients in practical use cases is extremely difficult, if not impossible, when taking these considerations into account, especially when the training takes more than one local iteration.

These BN layers contain a strong prior in the forms of tracked running statistics of the training data and can be effectively leveraged in gradient-based attack scenarios. During evaluation (i.e., inference), the estimated running mean and variance are used in lieu of computing on-the-fly batch-wise statistics. However, previous efforts [13] , [15] , [19] have not taken into account the effect of running statistics in the BN layers and only utilized gradient updates that were sent by assuming fixed BN statistics. As a result, matching the gradient updates that are sent during the training phase is not possible since the running statistics from BN layers affect the gradient computation. In our attack scenario, we consider the server as \"honest but curious\" [16] . Hence all global models, configuration files, local model updates and training BN statistics that exist on the server or are exchanged between the server and client can be considered as compromised for a potential gradient inversion attack. Figure 2 illustrates an overview of our attack model. We formally define the attack scenario for one server-client configuration which can be extended to all participating clients in FL. Consider client k having local model F k with weights W k , the model updates \u2206W k are computed with respect to mini-batches from the local training images x k and their corresponding labels y k .

The deep feature embeddings of reconstructions, as well as the entire pool of training images are computed using a pretrained network (e.g., ResNet-18 trained on ImageNet).

Except for client 9, each client training set contains the same number of normal and COVID-positive cases in order to simulate clients with balanced class distributions. Client 9 shares its only training image (a normal case) and its validation set with client 1. As a result, client 9 is at the highest risk of data leakage as it is sending model updates based on a single image and a batch size of one and will be referred to as the \"high-risk client\".

Therefore, the clients in these efforts only updated model weights while executing the training with fixed BN statistics. Here, we show that when the attacked clients update BN layers during training, an additional BN loss is essential for the attack to succeed. The running mean and variance of the BN layers need to be updated during the optimization of the inversion attack as these statistics inevitably change during training. Since a gradient inversion attack is a second-order optimization problem, the accumulated errors in estimating the BN statistics by assuming fixed values hinder successful reconstructions of training data (see Fig.  3b ). In addition, it is critical to initialize the network of inversion attack with the same global model weights that are used to initialize the client's network in a particular FL round to ensure the exact simulation of local training steps within the attack (see Fig. 3c ).",

Here, we explore a simple DP protocol that adds calibrated Gaussian noise, with zero mean, based on the gradient magnitudes of the model updates (see Section II-C). We evaluate this technique on client 9, which is the high-risk client, using model updates that are sent at round 90. As shown in Fig. 5c , the image reconstruction quality, as measured by the SSIM between original and recovered images, expectedly degrades as more noise is added to model updates from the client. The SSIM value between the prior which is used to initialize the gradient inversion attack (see II-B) and the original image is 0.37 (see Fig. 6 ). This can be considered as a lower bound of this metric during the attack. In addition, as the noise level increases, reconstructions from model updates with added DP become closer to the prior image and less similar to the original training image. This indicates that a privacy setting (\u03c3) allowing only a reconstruction with a SSIM value equal to or less than that between the original image and the prior could be considered \"safe\". For instance, as shown in Fig. 6 , this behavior can be observed for the high-risk client 9 at FL round 90 and noise added with \u03c3 =10 \u22122 .",

Therefore, we utilize a relative percentage change with respect to a reference point to compute a more comparable quantitative metric across different clients. We define a new metric denoted as \"Relative Data Leakage Value\" (RDLV) to measure the relative percentage change of the similarity metric (SSIM) for reconstructions from different clients' model updates. Given a training image T i , the prior used in the gradient inversion attack P , and the corresponding reconstruction I i , RDLV is defined as: Fig. 7 illustrates the RDLV based on different differential privacy settings for each client. Each line shows the average central tendency and a 95% confidence interval (bands shown in the plot) estimated using bootstrapping (with 1000 trials) on reconstructions that achieve the highest SSIM with any of the original training images during different rounds of FL. As observed, only the high-risk client 9, which sends model updates from training one iteration on one image, leaks the training data up to a certain amount of noise which corresponds to a positive value of RDLV (up to around \u03c3 0 \u226525 for most FL rounds in this case). A positive percentage change indicates that the reconstructions are more similar to the original images than the prior used in the gradient inversion attack. In addition, clients with more than one training . SSIM can be used to measure both the similarity between an original image and reconstruction or the similarity between the prior image used in the attack and the original image. An SSIM value below the one compared with the prior could indicate that no useful information was leaked or is recoverable by the attack. Note: the patient's name and date of birth in the original image are randomly generated.",

            "text": "We furthermore adjusted the Image Identifiability Precision (IIP) proposed in Yin et al. [14] to the FL scenario. Our specific approach is outlined in Section II-D. IIP measures the amount of identifiable information leaked in the gradient inversion attack by counting the closest exact matches between the reconstructions from the membership attack and the original training images for each client. As shown in Fig. 9 , the high-risk client 9 (updates sent based on 1 image and 1 iteration) attains the highest IIP score of 1.0 up to a Gaussian noise level \u03c3 0 value of \u223c20. This indicates that the attacker is able to determine the exact image that participated in FL training for that specific client. Furthermore, all other clients already achieve significantly lower values of the IIP score (e.g., <0.1) with much lower Gaussian noise levels \u03c3 0 . We also show the cosine similarity (dotted lines) between the reconstructions and original images identifying exact members of the training set at each client based on ImageNetpretrained ResNet-18 [20] feature embeddings. As expected, cosine similarity values also decrease with higher Gaussian noise levels. In this work, we have introduced a new way to measure the data leakage in horizontal FL for chest X-ray image classification and proposed several ways to quantify and visualize it. Overall, we conclude that FL security is multifaceted. Clients which send updates based on a small number of training images are at a higher risk of leaking data than the clients sending updates based on larger training sets as well as higher numbers of local training iterations. Furthermore, larger batch sizes make reconstruction via gradient inversion attacks more difficult, a finding that is in line with previous literature [13] - [15] . Table II summarizes our overall conclusions based on the findings shown in this study. While sending model updates using a single training image is at a high risk of data leakage, clients that utilize more realistic settings, such as larger number of training images and large number of local iterations as common in real-world FL scenarios, are not at a high risk of leaking identifiable information. Specifically, gradient inversion attacks for clients that iterate over several images before sending model updates are harder due to accumulated errors in the estimation of BN statistics. In this scenario, the attack is executed using only an approximation of the BN statistics (see Fig. 4, Fig. 5a , and Section II-B).",

In our experience, removing access to the state of only the most important layers can render the attack ineffective. Specifically, this could be achieved efficiently by utilizing cryptographic techniques such as homomorphic encryption to allow secure aggregation of model updates [33] . Encryption would ensure that the server never holds the complete unencrypted model to avoid a potential gradient inversion attack while adding negligible computing requirements. 2) If the attacker does not have access to the model architecture, attempting to match the gradients will become very challenging. The clients could be sending only numerical arrays of model updates to be aggregated on the server without the server ever holding the information about the current model architecture or training procedure. While theoretically, the attacker could infer common architectures from the size of the parameter arrays, in practice, it would become extremely difficult, if not impossible, to deduce the exact architecture, especially for customized architectures often used in healthcare applications. 3) For models that are trained with BN, not sending the BN statistics to the server causes the gradient inversion attack to fail (see Fig. 3 . Techniques such as FedBN [41] , [42] could reduce the risk of server-side attacks by keeping personalized BN statistics specific to each client. One negative aspect of this approach is the lack of a common global model after FL training since only an ensemble of personalized client models would be available.",

We conclude that previous efforts likely exaggerated the risks of gradient inversion attacks in FL, and that our work builds a foundation towards a better understanding of the real risks of such attacks in real-world FL applications. In most cases, it becomes very difficult for an attacker to recover any training images, as common FL scenarios involve model updates from sufficiently large numbers of batch sizes, training images, and local iterations that detrimentally impact the success of current gradient inversion attacks. Furthermore, we listed several effective protection methods that could be easily incorporated into any FL system to render existing attacks futile. We believe that our work is a step towards establishing reproducible methods of measuring data leakage in FL and therefore builds a framework for finding an optimal tradeoff between privacy and accuracy based on quantifiable metrics.",
