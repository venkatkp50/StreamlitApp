            "text": "Since the first modern air conditioner was invented in 1902 [1] , human activities rely increasingly on climate-controlled indoor environments. Most super-spreader events of the COVID-19 pandemic have been recorded within the indoor environment. Professional engineering societies that design heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems rely on the steady-state Wells-Riley equation for a single room as a simple model to develop indoor ventilation standards and guidelines [2] . Yet, assuming a single room has led to some recommendations that are not practical to implement at the whole building scale. For example, some have recommended increasing outdoor air to 100% (assuming outdoor air is virus free), even though most HVAC systems are not capable of supplying 100% outdoor air because HVAC systems are designed and sized to balance requirements for thermal comfort, acceptable indoor air quality, and energy use. (Most commercial buildings including skyscrapers have moved away from the use of operable windows, rendering natural ventilation techniques useless.) Furthermore, taking in 100% outdoor air means exhausting ~100% of the indoor air to effectively balance building pressure requirements, and most buildings do not filter respiratory droplets but exhaust them directly outside presenting an unquantified risk to the surrounding population. Ventilation standards (e.g., air change rates) have remained almost unchanged in the past century. It is time to re-evaluate how mechanical ventilation is used to reduce viral loading and minimize disease transmission coherent with accumulated knowledge in virus transmission.",

Unlike nonenveloped viruses (e.g., polio) that can be infectious outside of respiratory droplets, enveloped viruses must remain in humid environments to be fully infectious. Therefore, reducing the spread of respiratory droplets is essential to slowing the spread of respiratory viruses including but not limited to SARS-CoV-2. The extent of each type of respiratory droplet release varies with, at least, index patient behavior (coughing, sneezing, singing, laughing, talking, breathing, and the vigor of such), the viral loading of the droplets, and the natural history of the disease (a term of art in medicine). However, the droplet size distributions from the respiratory/oral tract are approximately invariant even if their absolute/relative magnitudes and viral loading vary. Therefore, while we cannot predict the next respiratory illness that buildings will be asked to ameliorate, we can evaluate the spread of different types of droplets so that when the next disease does arrive, we will be better prepared.",

            "text": "Respiratory droplets have a distinctive set of modes in their size distributions, which has not always been recognized in transport and fate analyses. Yang and Marr [3] evaluated the removal efficiencies and droplet size distributions in a single room for influenza A but did not include multiroom effects and only looked at the largest droplet sizes based on the seminal work of Duguid [4] in 1946, which misses the smaller sizes that may transit air handling systems more readily. Indeed, Morawska [5] reviews size distributions from various sources and asserts that early investigators only looked at the \"super-micrometer size\". Johnson, et al., [6] evaluated the modality of size distributions of human expired aerosols. They divided the size distribution into three modes labeled the (B) bronchiolar fluid film burst mode, the (L) laryngeal mode, and the (O) oral mode, and give the B mode as centered at 1.6 \uf06dm, the L mode as centered at 1.7-2.5 \uf06dm, and the O as centered at 123-145 \uf06dm. Each mode has a broad distribution and assumptions made during analysis may shift these modes by a factor of two. Asadi, et al., [7] showed that different types of speech produce different amounts of respiratory droplets with substantially more droplets from louder speech. The droplets are typically on the order of a micrometer, consistent with the L mode. Gregson, et al., [8] found quiet singing, speaking and breathing to be statistically similar to each other but at the loudest volumes substantially more aerosol mass is focused on sizes <20 \uf06dm. Fennelly [9] reviews bioaerosols and asserts that droplets <5 \uf06dm deposit in the lower human respiratory tract (bronchi 2.1-3.3 \uf06dm; aveoli 0.65-1.1 \uf06dm) but larger particles 6-12 \uf06dm deposit in the upper airways. In contrast to the assertion of Johnson, et al., [6] , Fennelly [9] asserts that some viruses concentrate more in breath (i.e., B and L modes) than in cough (i.e., O mode) including human rhinovirus. Indeed, they report more viral RNA is found in smaller particles than larger, but whether this translates into intact infectious virus concentrations remains unclear.",

This analysis evaluates the fate of these three types of respiratory droplets through centralized air handling systems. Even at the height of pandemics most people one meets are not infectious. The fraction of the people in public that may be contagious may be estimated via Eq. 14 for SARS-CoV-2 in the US April through October 2020 as ~0.6%. It is to reduce exposure to this small but infectious fraction of the population that interventions including distancing, masks, and ventilation, etc. are designed to protect against.

The room in which viral shedding occurs is termed the source room and other rooms connected via the air handling system are termed connected rooms. Figure 2 shows that as the duration of viral shedding increases, the concentration of infectious respiratory droplets in both the source and connected rooms increases. In the source room, respiratory droplets generated are removed by settling, viral degradation, and removal through the air handling system, though some respiratory droplets may be re-introduced by the air handling system. When the rate of generation is balanced by these removal mechanisms, the concentration of respiratory droplets achieves a steady state. This steady-state concentration is the highest concentration achieved. As the duration of viral shedding decreases (because biological sources cease, personal protective equipment is donned, or the shedding individual leaves the building), the concentration in the source room drops with a J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f time scale set by the viral decay rate, the droplet settling rate, and the ventilation rate. The concentration within the connected room is further attenuated by settling and viral decay within the air handling system including the plenum and ducting, which lower the concentration and extend the concentration decay times within the connected rooms relative to the source room. Subsequent figures evaluate concentration profiles and droplet size distributions at the 5 minute and steady-state extrema shown in Fig. 2 . Table 3 for mode B. The curves that do not monotonically increase (dashed or colored online) initially rise with the steady release curve and then fall once the source stops emitting infectious virus after times from a few minutes to three hours.

The droplet distributions as described by Johnson, et al., [6] are approximately log-normal and are for respiratory droplets or dried particles that contain virus and not for naked virus alone. For example, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has a size, inclusive of spike proteins, of 0.05-0.20 microns, which is smaller than the droplets represented in the figure [20] . Each distribution here is normalized to one by integrating over size in standard statistical form. Each of the four panels shows that the size distribution of the bronchiolar mode does not change substantially over time in either the source room or connected rooms as distributions by number or volume. In contrast, the respiratory droplets of the oral mode do change over time substantially in both rooms, shrinking over time. The oral droplets in J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the connected rooms are smaller than the ones in the source room but appear to approach an ~10 \uf06dm diameter over time. The laryngeal droplets do change but only marginally. These droplet sizes are important because the bronchiolar and laryngeal droplets deposit in the lower human respiratory tract (bronchi 2.1-3.3 \uf06dm; alveoli 0.65-1.1 \uf06dm), in contrast to the larger droplets (6-12 \uf06dm) that deposit in the upper airways consistent with those remaining from the oral distribution [9] . Figure 3 shows that the bronchiolar respiratory droplets do transit through central ventilation systems (in contrast to the oral droplets that do not as shown in the figures below), suggesting that though the risk for an upper respiratory infection may be substantial in the source room, the risk for a lower respiratory infection dominates the connected rooms and is only partially ameliorated by central ventilation systems.",

However, they did not resolve the bronchiolar and laryngeal mode, which changes much less dramatically. These distributions also differ from Yang and Marr [3] because they are normalized in a statistical sense permitting the concentration (subsequent figures) and the size distributions (Fig. 3) to be decoupled (i.e., the size distributions in Fig. 3 are normalized by concentration).

These rates are infectious species specific, and Figure 4 is specific to SARS-CoV-2 [13] . The droplet size distributions do not change meaningfully with changes in either humidity or temperature but overlap trivially on the corresponding curves of Fig. 3 (not shown) . This is an important point, because it makes the size distributions of Fig. 3 independent of the species within the respiratory droplets and a surprise because Yang and Marr [3] suggest that the size distributions would depend on humidity (temperature was not part of their analysis). However, the profiles of concentration versus time do vary meaningfully with relative humidity and temperature. Figure 4 shows that as the relative humidity or the temperature increases, the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f concentration of infectious respiratory droplets decreases. Because the primary cause of this change is through the viral degradation rate, the concentration of infectious and non-infectious respiratory droplets would not be expected to show a strong temperature or relative humidity effect once the droplets are formed and in the absence of modest droplet size change when the relative humidity increases, as articulated by Yang and Marr [3] . Humidity differentiated probabilities of infection are not well established in the literature and are not addressed herein. Though the temperature range is limited to \u226510 o C in the data of Dabish, et al., [13] on which these curves are based, our finding that lower temperatures increase the concentration of infectious respiratory droplets is consistent with the observation of super-spreader events in cold storage facilities, meat packing plants, and increased viral spread during the colder months of the year. The observation of decreased concentrations of infectious respiratory droplets under increased temperature or relative humidity presents an opportunity to design and operate air handling systems to reduce the load of infectious respiratory droplets, though this article does not address the energy costs or design changes necessary to make such an approach effective.",

            "text": "In the remainder of this analysis, we now consider a continuous viral shedding event (Figs. 5-6) and evaluate its concentration profiles (Fig. 5 ) and infectious probabilities (Fig. 6 ) versus time for each of the droplet modes. Corresponding figures for a five-minute viral shedding event are found in Appendix A as Figs. A1-A2. The focus is on temporal profiles because the droplet size distributions for the B and L modes change but modestly in contrast to the concentration profiles that change substantially over time. Figure 5 presents concentration profiles corresponding to a continuous viral release event. The panels on the left correspond to the spatially averaged concentration in the source room and the panels on the right correspond to the spatially averaged concentration in the connected room. As seen in Fig. 1 , the concentration of each mode added to the source room has the same peak concentration. In each source room, the resulting concentrations of the B and L modes are similar. However, the well mixed concentration of the O mode rises but insignificantly commensurate with this mode's larger size and corresponding fast settling rate. This suggests that very little of the O mode is available for transit into the connected rooms as seen in Fig. 5 . The amount of O that does transit into the connected rooms may be very small and depends at least on the balance between settling rates and local air velocities. This rapid loss of the largest droplet sizes is similar to that observed by Yang and Marr [3] based on the large droplet size distribution of Duguid [4] . Figure 5 also evaluates the cases in Table 3 , which span changes in filtration, air change rates, and amount of outdoor air added. Panels a and b show that filtration decreases the concentration of particles in the source room and more dramatically in the connected rooms. These filtration efficiencies are based on filtration efficiencies of Dols and Polidoro [12] and may differ from commercially available filters. Panels c and d show that increasing the ACH decreases the concentration in the source room. Yet, in contrast to packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) systems found in motels, central ventilation systems connect the flow across rooms providing a means of respiratory droplet spread to connected rooms. In the connected rooms, higher ACH translates into faster exposure but also faster removal of respiratory droplets from the connected room, which translates into some unexpected and nonlinear infection probabilities. Simply increasing the ACH does not always translate into a lower probability of infection. Although in principle preventing recirculation in buildings may be ideal as a means of preventing respiratory droplet spread into connected rooms, recirculation is \"hard wired\" into a substantial portion of the world's building supply. Panels e and f highlight the relatively modest J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f influence of outdoor air in both source and connected rooms for the range of variation considered (0-33% outdoor air fraction). These trends with respect to filtration, air change rates, and outdoor air addition are similar to the 5-minute shedding event previously described by Pease, et al., [10] albeit not differentiated by respiratory droplet type. In each of these variations, three features stand out. First, the absence of the O mode in each set of curves is distinctive. Second, the B and L droplets have similar trends and are close together in each connected room case and even closer in the source room, which is not surprising given their similarity in peak size (1.6 \uf06dm versus 2.4 \uf06dm). Third, the L mode is always below the B mode because removal by droplet settling rates and filtration efficiencies increase with size in this range (Fig. 1) . The finding of significant quantities of B and L droplets in the connected room(s) is important because it indicates that these smaller droplet sizes may be most responsible for spread of infectious particles in respiratory droplets through air handling systems.",

Indeed, for most times, the concentration rises linearly after a short induction period. Filtration reduces the risk, increased air flow rates decrease risk in the source room, and more outdoor air is helpful in both rooms. What is unusual with respect to risk is what is happening in the connected rooms as air change rates vary (Fig. 6d) where the curves exchange. Each curve has a different slope and a different induction period so that the scenario which has the highest risk changes with time. Please also note that in all cases because there is linear increase in risk the probabilities of infection can mount quickly and do not plateau like the short-term release cases (see Fig. A2 ). This leads to substantially higher probabilities than seen for short duration exposures.",
