Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection on alveolar macrophages determines a phenotypical switch of short-living alveolar macrophage to their immortalized form. In these conditions, macrophages may migrate inside the lung parenchyma, where they could become infected resident cells, perpetuating the infection, and increasing inflammation [8] . At the basis of this pulmonary hyperinflammatory response, it has been postulated that alveolar macrophages can express and activate Nod-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, which has been identified as one of the most detrimental signalling molecules in ARDS. Moreover, NLRP3 is known to coordinate this uncontrolled inflammatory response, and, for this reason, its possible inhibition can be considered as a novel target to develop COVID-19 supportive therapies [9] [10] [11] . Drugs potentially manageable for home therapies able to target the most involved mediators in ARDS onset would be crucial in reducing the pressure on the intensive care units and hospitalizations.",

Although there are currently several trials on the possible use of PEA as a support to anti-COVID19 therapies [20] generically based on its anti-inflammatory activity, the molecular effects of PEA in the course of hyperinflammation processes induced by SARS-CoV-2 are yet to be characterized. To define new possible PEA molecular targets that could aid in SARS-CoV-2 infection, we used cultured alveolar macrophages isolated by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid in mice, to evaluate (1) the in vitro protective effect(s) of um-PEA in SP-challenged macrophages as a model of hyper-inflammatory response evoked by SARS-CoV-2 viral protein challenge; and (2) the ability of um-PEA to target the TLR4 and NLRP3 signalling pathways activated by SP increasing concentration and the consequent over-release of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 cytokines by challenged macrophages.",

This observation is reinforced by an in silico study that demonstrated the interaction between SP and TLRs and raised the hypothesis that their related pathways may have a role in the inflammatory consequences of COVID-19. The molecular docking study demonstrated a significant binding between the viral SP and innate immune receptors with the highest binding energy reported with TLR4 [24, 25] . In addition to this, it has been recently found (by Zhao, Y., Kuang, M., Li, J. et al.) that SARS-CoV-2 infection provoked an anti-bacterial-like response at the very early stage of infection via TLR4. In addition, they found that the induction of IL-1\u03b2 by SARS-CoV-2 was completely blocked by TLR4-specific inhibitor Resatorvid. In the same study, a surface plasmon resonance assay showed that SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer directly bound to TLR4 with an affinity of~300 nM [26] .",

Most of the anti-inflammatory properties of PEA arise from its ability to antagonize the NF-\u03baB signalling pathway via the activation of PPARs receptors, with highest affinity on PPAR-\u03b1 [14, 15] . The prominent role of PPAR-\u03b1 receptors in our experimental condition was confirmed by the fact that PPAR-\u03b1 -/-macrophages did not shown any significant reduction of main pro-inflammatory markers released even following concentration of 10 \u22125 M um-PEA. um-PEA can inhibit NF-\u03baB with a dual mechanism, either by physically interacting with NF-\u03baB p65 or by upregulating the expression of inhibitors of NF-\u03baB (I\u03baBs) in many cell types [35] . In our model, the antagonism on the NF-\u03baB signalling pathway was confirmed. In a concentration-dependent fashion, um-PEA treatment led to a decrease in both p50 and p65 proteins, and consequently to the related activation cascade (TLR4 and pp38 MAPK). By inhibiting NF-\u03baB expression, um-PEA was able to downstream regulate several genes involved in pro-inflammatory cytokines transcription, resulting in a lower release of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 (see Figure 4 ). Moreover, for the first time, we showed a significant concentration-dependent decrease in NLRP3 and thus in the inflammasome activation in the group treated with um-PEA 10 \u22127 M. Besides, um-PEA was capable of reducing the expression of ACE-2 on the macrophages' membrane as a probable result of its anti-inflammatory effects.",

The inhibition of NLRP3/caspase-1 pathway in alveolar macrophages operated by um-PEA may be crucial even in preventing pyroptosis [36, 37] . Preventing pyroptosis may be strategical because, in several pathological conditions and models, it has been observed that massive macrophages NLRP3/caspase-1-induced pyroptosis led to an enhanced neutrophil recruitment [38] [39] [40] [41] . In contrast to tissue-resident macrophages, neutrophils are more immunoreactive, and their activation led to a more severe inflammation. activation cascade (TLR4 and pp38 MAPK).

Cell pellet, obtained after centrifugation, was then re-suspended in a volume of 80 \u00b5L ice-cold hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mMphenylmethylsulphonylfluoride, 1.5 \u00b5g/mL soybean trypsin inhibitor, 7 \u00b5g/mL pepstatin A, 5 \u00b5g/mL leupeptin, 0.1 mM benzamidine and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)). The suspension was rapidly passed through a syringe needle five to six times to facilitate cell lysis and underwent 15 min at 13,000\u00d7 g centrifugation. The proteins were mixed with a non-reducing gel loading buffer [50 mM Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris), 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 10% glycerol, 2 mg bromophenol/mL] at a 1:1 ratio, and boiled for 3 min followed by centrifugation at 10,000\u00d7 g for 10 min. The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay, and 50 \u00b5g of each homogenate was used for electrophoresis using polyacrylamide mini gels. Proteins were thus transferred to nitrocellulose membranes saturated by incubation with 10% non-fat dry milk in 1X PBS overnight at 4 \u2022 C and then incubated with specific primary antibody (see Table 1 ). Membranes were then incubated with the specific secondary antibodies conjugated to HRP. Immune complexes were identified by enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences, Milan, Italy), and the blots were analyzed by scanning densitometry (Versadoc MP4000; Bio-Rad, Segrate, Italy). The results were expressed as optical density (OD; arbitrary units = mm 2 ) and normalized against the expression of the housekeeping protein \u03b2-actin. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 (all from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was carried out, according to the manufacturer's protocol, on cells' supernatants of both wild type and PPAR\u03b1 -/-cells 24 h after treatments. Absorbance was measured on a microtiter plate reader. IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 levels were determined using standard curves method.",

To block the non-specific binding site, a solution of 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used. Depending upon the experiments, macrophages were incubated for 30 min with specific primary antibody (see Table 2 ) and further incubated in the dark with specific secondary antibody. The cells were analyzed using an inverted immunofluorescence microscope (HBO fluorescence microscope IM-3FL4, Optika Microscope, Bergamo, Italy), and images were captured (20X magnification) by a high-resolution digital camera (HDMI 4083.13-ext 12V 2000 mA, Optika Microscopes, Bergamo, Italy).
