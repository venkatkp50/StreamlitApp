The safety and efficacy of this manoeuvre has only been demonstrated for 45 methotrexate in the setting of influenza vaccination in rheumatoid arthritis. Although an 46 extrapolation to patients with skin disease and COVID-19 vaccination is reasonable, specific 47 data is missing. Patients with skin conditions treated with Janus Kinase Inhibitors (JAKi) may 48 flare more rapidly upon drug cessation than those treated with methotrexate as has been 49 demonstrated in pre-clinical models 4 ; thus, we agree with the authors that withholding JAKi 50 cannot be routinely recommended at this time. The final decision to withhold immunotherapy to 51 maximize vaccine efficacy will always be a risk/benefit discussion between the patient and were more likely to mount a satisfactory immune response. 5 58These findings are in keeping with our conclusion that dermatology patients treated with anti-59 metabolite immunosuppressive therapies may demonstrate variable antibody levels against 60 SARS-CoV-2. This study also supports the possibility that dermatology patients treated with 61 mycophenolate may show decreased post-vaccination antibody titres. We look forward to 62 reviewing further data regarding real-world SARS-CoV-2 vaccine efficacy in dermatologic 63 patient populations as it becomes available following more widespread SARS-CoV-",
