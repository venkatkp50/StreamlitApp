[3] Up till now, COVID-19 has swept globally. [4] Based on the symptom, COVID-19 include mild, ordinary, severe, and critical types. [5] The clinical manifestations of patient include fever, cough, nasal congestion, runny nose, diarrhea, dyspnea, muscle or joint pain, pneumonia, and even death. [5] Currently, the therapies recommended by western clinical practice guidelines for COVID-19 include antiviral, oxygen therapy, and nutritional support, however, no specific and effective drug is available for COVID-19. [6] In China, Chinese traditional medicine is recommended by the Chinese Clinical Guidance of COVID-19 Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment (7th edition) published by China National Health Commission on March 4, 2020, which includes Xuebijing injection, lianhua qingwen granules, and jinhua qinggan granules.

[8] [9] [10] [11] [12] TJQW includes 16 TCM components, including Forsythiae Fructus (lian-qiao), edible tulip (shan-ci-gu), Lonicera japonica (Japanese honeysuckle flower, jin-yin-hua), Radix Scutellariae baicalensis (huang-qin), Folium Isatidis (da-qing-ye), Bupleurum root (chai-hu), Artemisia apiacea (qing-hao), Periostracum Cicadae (chan-tui), Radix Peucedani (qian-hu), Fritillaria cirrhosa (chuan-bei-mu), Fritillaria thunbergii (zhe-bei-mu), Poria cocos (fu-ling), Fructus Mume (wu-mei), radix Scrophulariae (xuan-shen), Astragalus The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.",
