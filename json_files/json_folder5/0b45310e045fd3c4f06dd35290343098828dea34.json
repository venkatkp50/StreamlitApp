This comparison offers a unique model of disease mortality in genetically similar populations and allows for further analyses of the true effectiveness of interventions via national political mechanisms and modern communication tools in combatting the spread of epidemic respiratory disease. We used data on multiple plague outbreaks which afflicted regions of present-day Italy during the 16th and 17th centuries for this historical comparison.",

Among these, infectious respiratory diseases that are able to be transmitted similarly to COVID-19, such as tuberculosis, influenza, and bacterial pneumonia, are commonly reported by provinces throughout the country (ISTAT, 2017) . In this paper, we utilize recent data on those endemic diseases to pursue the testing of hypotheses relevant to the variable effects of epidemics. This is particularly useful in the case of COVID-19 and its probable transition to endemicity, as work in historical epidemiology is yet to address differences between the mortality patterns of pre-transition epidemics with those occurring prior while controlling for contemporary endemic disease.",

Causes of death can vary based on population density, economic status, and subsequent access to higher qualities of care. In comparison with case prevalence, on the other hand, mortality is a dependable indicator of the severity of infectious disease in a region. It is also more reliably controlled via population-level variables, such as average age and wealth. One key aspect of studies on population age and infectious disease mortality is the difference between studying the age of an individual as the risk factor for mortality versus the mean age of a population. This is because, whereas older individuals do not singlehandedly influence population-level spread, older populations do (Dowd et al., 2020; McKeown, 2009) . Younger populations are more likely to be associated with higher frequencies of infectious disease spread, but not necessarily higher mortality rates (Dowd et al., 2020; McKeown, 2009) . Older populations experience the same trend in the inverse (Dowd et al., 2020; McKeown, 2009 ). In the case of wealth, multiple studies appear to support the hypothesis that greater wealth (in terms of GDP per capita) lessens the risk of mortality, especially in developed countries (Wood et al., 2017) . In this paper, we test both hypotheses based on average wealth and age in relation to infectious disease mortality in Italy.",

In particular, latitude and longitude, altitude, temperature, humidity, and rainfall are often used in predicting the prevalence of infectious disease in a region (Anderson, 2004) . Additionally, regions that are associated with more tropical climates are predicted to host and facilitate increased spread of a more diverse range of infectious diseases (Anderson, 2004) . Though other reasons help to explain the trend, this is largely hypothesized to be a result of the cold seasons occurring in temperate climates, which force common hosts of infectious diseases such as outdoor-living rodents and insects into burrowing or hibernation for multiple months each year (Grassly and Fraser, 2006) . These hypotheses are considered in our analyses wherever both present and historical data are available. Temperature, humidity, and rainfall could not be included because of insufficient historical data (for the provincial level) to compare the impacts of historical physical ecology on plague outbreaks with present physical ecology and COVID-19. Without these data, such hypotheses would require estimates which may be unreliable, especially at the provincial level.",

Such findings may benefit inquiries into the allocation of funding and resources for provincial, regional, and national healthcare organizations. In the case of Italy, this is especially necessary when considering the early prevention of future outbreaks, something which must be addressed if policymakers are to legislate on the severe healthcare strain-both in personnel and equipment-faced as a result of COVID-19 (Armocida et al., 2020) . This has been particularly problematic in Northern Italy, where hospitals had already been receiving people from Southern Italy due to substantially higher levels of reported dissatisfaction with local hospital care in the South than in the North (Lo Scalzo et al., 2009) . As a result, several nations contributed members of their healthcare personnel and supplies to Italy to combat the first wave of COVID-19.",

            "text": "As we will discuss further, these trends do not appear to be a novel development in the history of infectious diseases in Italy. Long before COVID-19, numerous city-states which now comprise the Italian Republic were hit by multiple severe plague epidemics. Three types of plague collectively form the disease caused by Yersinia Pestis in the Black Death: Bubonic, Pneumonic, and Septicemic (Gage and Kosoy, 2005) . Bubonic plague-the one most likely spread by ship rats-can only be spread horizontally through vectors such as fleas or rodents. Pneumonic plague can be spread via both horizontal and direct transmission such as the inhalation of aerosolized bacterium from infected people. Septicemic plague, which possesses the highest mortality rate of the three plague types but is the least commonly found, can also be spread via both horizontal and direct transmission. In this paper, we focus on the four major plague outbreaks in Italy during the 16th and 17th centuries. Reliable mortality data were available from these outbreaks. Other plague data from years prior to the 16th century and subsequent to the 17th century are reported in Biraben (1976) but were not used in the present study because of concerns from ourselves and multiple other authors regarding their reliability (Alfani, 2013a (Alfani, , 2013b Roosen and Curtis, 2018) . Lastly, though we are aware of the microbiological and clinical distinctions necessary when addressing bacterial versus viral infection, we consider the similar respiratory transmission of both plague and COVID-19 as most relevant to our hypotheses. The likelihood of human-to-human transmission of medieval and early modern plague is, however, still debated in the historical epidemiology literature, largely due to the differences between the three types of plague discussed above (Whittles and Didelot, 2016) . In this work, we are solely interested in studying the relative mortality differences across geography and between major epidemic events, emphasizing the similarities of epidemics preserved through substantial political and technological change. Thus, we do not consider there to be any serious disadvantages to such a comparison for this nuanced context, regardless of the discrepancies present.",

            "text": "Two major plague pandemics have been recorded in human history. The one most relevant to this paper is the second, the so-called Black Death of the early 14th Century. Having originated in Central Asia, potentially at a plague reservoir in the Steppes, plague spread first to Italy and then throughout Eurasia and North Africa. Its arrival in Italy appears to be the result of a Mongol invasion targeting Genoese colonists, of Caffa, in Crimea (Gottfried, 2010). Ship rats (R. rattus) appear to have further exacerbated the spread of plague through other trading sites contacted by those first merchant ships to encounter infection. This 14th century pandemic was followed by several regional epidemics in subsequent centuries. Italy was struck by multiple plague outbreaks, including in 1575-77 in Palermo and Venice, 1624 in Sicily, 1629-31 throughout Central and Northern Italy (also known as the Great Plague of Milan), and 1656-57 in Naples and several other Southern Italian regions (also known as the Great Plague of Naples).",

Per Aberth (2013) , Florence reached a mortality of 55% of its population based on the frequency of tax-paying households. Likewise, based on the number of salt tax-payers in the city of San Gimignano, in Tuscany, this urban center suffered a mortality of 52% from 1332 to 1350. Although still impacted by the plague, other Tuscan contados featured lower mortality rates (Aberth, 2013) . From 1339 to 1352, Pratto had a mortality of 39%. Villages in Piedmont, from 1335 to 1356, also experienced a 40% demographic reduction according to the tax-paying household data from that period (Aberth, 2013) .",

For instance, military registers of enrolling men between the ages of 18-69 in Bologna, Emilia Romagna, revealed a 35% population decline in the year 1349 alone (Aberth, 2013) . Along similar lines, changes in the military enrollment of men between the ages of 16-70 in Siena, Tuscany, revealed a plague mortality of 51%. More recent estimates indicate that Piedmont and Tuscany experienced mortality rates of approximately 60%. Parishes in Lucca featured a slightly higher rate of 64%. Cities such as San Gimignano suffered a loss of 60% of their population in the span of two years (from 1348 to 1350; Cesana et al., 2017) . Alternatively, other locations underwent a slightly less severe population contraction due to the plague. For example, the commune of Pratto lost around 44.5% of its citizens (Cesana et al., 2017) . It is relevant to mention that, despite these regional differences, the average plague mortality rate for Italy was consistent with that of other European countries, including England and France (Benedictow, 2021; Cesana et al., 2017) .",

            "text": "The case of Milan deserves special attention. Some scholars have argued that Milan was not considerably affected by the 1348 plague pandemic despite its northern geographical location (Byrne, 2012; Martin, 2007) . According to the historian Agnolo di Tura, only three families in the city were afflicted by the disease (Byrne, 2012) . Historical records suggest that the Milanese government adopted unusually strict measures to prevent spread of the plague. Guards were posted at every gate of the city to hinder the entrance of potentially infected visitors. Likewise, afflicted individuals were locked down in their homes (Byrne, 2012) . Other regulations under Bernab\u00f2 Visconti, Lord of Milan, authorized the treasury to seize, without restitution, the goods and property of infected individuals carrying the disease from another place (Horrox, 2013) . People attending to someone who died of the plague were told to wait for at least 10 days before returning to the city. Under penalty of death, parish priests were instructed to examine the sick to determine the nature of the affliction and notify any plague cases to the appropriate authorities (Horrox, 2013) . The cumulative effect of these public policies resulted in Milan having relatively no contact with other nearby towns by 1399. Around 1374, Duke Giangaleazzo proposed even harsher measures to reduce the spread of the plague, such as relocating the diseased to plague houses, or mansiones, outside of the city (Byrne, 2012) . Furthermore, the ducal government also carried out frequent fumigations of infected households after relocating afflicted people and their families to extramural sites. Circa 1424-1452, the Milanese administration also created the Office of the Ducal Health Commissioner, an institutional position in charge of maintaining a registry of the causes and number of deaths in the city (Necrologi; Carmichael, 1983; Cohn Jr and Alfani, 2007) . Centuries ahead of their time, the Milanese also created an array of geographical charts featuring mortality patterns (Byrne, 2012) .",

Moreover, according to Azarius, Milanese refugees carried the disease to Parma. As reviewed by Benedictow (2021) , Bazano (1729) also claimed that Milan was severely affected by the Black Death between the months of May and September. Based on this historical evidence, Benedictow (2021) questioned the notion that Milan was relatively spared by the disease. The author argued that with a population of 150,000 inhabitants, Milan was, at the time, the largest, or at least, second-largest city in Europe (claiming that the Milanese population was close to 180,000; Kelly, 2005) .

One relevant aspect of population dynamics pertaining to the prevalence of infectious disease is the mobility of individuals from within and without a population to and from it. Beyond frequent trade with outside merchants, a series of wars occasioned the movement of large numbers of Italian people and troops within contested regions of Northern Italy. In particular, the Italian Wars, lasting from 1494 to 1559, involved several invasions of troops from outside Italy. Combatants included the French, Spanish, British, Swiss, Papacy, and other members of the Holy Roman Empire (Shaw, 2019) . This fighting continued until 1559 when Spain took control of Sicily and Naples in the South as well as Milan in the North. People in these regions were often displaced from their homes during the conflict or, when they were able, instead relocated to more peaceful regions elsewhere.

In the 16th and 17th centuries especially, Northern Italy was the site of substantial increases in trade (Alfani, 2013a (Alfani, , 2013b . Even with early defenses in place, such as communication regarding their health status between cities, defensive isolation following outbreaks, and a cordon sanitarie along much of both Italian coasts, the introduction of most of these plague epidemics can be traced to individuals entering Italy from other regions (Cliff et al., 2009 ). This continued, though guarded, movement of people to particularly open and popular cities could, therefore, have not only contributed to the introduction of plague to new areas but also exacerbated its spread once there. Additionally, Italian cities that were struck by famine, disease, or war casualties often needed to encourage movement to urban areas, sometimes, for example, offering labor incentives for workers in order to mitigate the effects of underpopulation following the crisis (Alfani, 2011) .",

This also implies that the spread of infectious endemic diseases may be different from that of epidemics, fundamentally emphasizing the role of spread within the localities in which they are endemic, rather than from people visiting or moving into those localities from elsewhere. In this paper, we chose to compare all three-historical plague outbreaks, currently endemic respiratory disease, and COVID-19-to approach these hypotheses empirically and discover whether or not outbreaks such as plague and COVID-19 are predicted by pathways of epidemic disease spread that are different from those of infectious endemic disease spread. In this case, more people moving to, or traveling through, a region are expected to increase the likelihood of infectious disease spread within that and surrounding regions. This is often discussed in the context of movement to nearby port cities, airports, or train stops, for tourism, employment, and other activities, something that is especially common in some of Italy's wealthier Northern regions. These hypotheses will be tested for immigration data covering all of modern Italy.",

Six cholera pandemics have occurred and each has variously impacted Italy (Byrne, 2008) . The first pandemic, for example, does not appear to have caused any major outbreaks within Italy. Many regions were, however, impacted by the second cholera pandemic, occurring from 1834 to 1837 and entering through Southern France (Hays, 1998) . Later, in 1866, the fourth cholera pandemic reached Italy via the Adriatic port of Ancona. Late in the 19th century, the second wave of the fifth pandemic caused a severe outbreak in Napoli, resulting in over 5000 deaths and over 2 years of continuous spread throughout neighboring regions (Snowden, 2002) . Lastly, the sixth cholera pandemic hit Italy in 1910, heavily impacting multiple Southern regions. Data on these historical cholera pandemics are non-existent at the provincial level in Italy. As a result, cholera was not able to be included in this paper's analyses.",

Recent research on C-C chemokinereceptor-5 (CCR5), and more specifically its 32 bp deletion variant (CCR5 \u039432), have found consistent negative associations for individual susceptibility to, and case severity of, COVID-19 infection in carriers of CCR5 \u039432 (Panda et al., 2020; Star\u010devi\u0107 \u010c izmarevi\u0107 et al., 2020; Cuesta-Llavona et al., 2021) . Adequate data are not available to investigate CCR5 \u039432 at the macro-regional or provincial levels in Italy, however, future studies on COVID-19 should consider testing hypotheses for both genetic predictors, given the similarity of their reported associations in recent literature. Additionally, multiple researchers have hypothesized that the distribution of haplogroup R1b is positively associated with increased susceptibility to COVID-19 infection and subsequently mortality risk (Delanghe et al., 2020) . Haplogroup R1b is found throughout Western Europe and traces back to the Late Neolithic, allowing for reliable historical analyses utilizing data for its present distribution. In the case of Italy, R1b is predominantly found in Northern Italian populations and, as a result, may underlie the previously discussed macroregional differences in COVID-19 prevalence and mortality. Unlike CCR5 \u039432, adequate macro regional data for R1b are available. This paper will be the first to test these population genetic hypotheses with regional data on the distribution of R1b throughout Italy. In addition, this will be the first analysis of R1b in relation to historical plague outbreaks and contemporary endemic disease mortality.",

Social ecology covers different dimensions of the social environment, from wealth and inequality to transportation and access to medical care (Figueredo et al., 2017; Figueredo et al., 2020) . Lastly, cognitive ecology includes domains such as a polity's average education level and its corresponding cognitive capital (Figueredo et al., 2021) . Overall, and as applied to the study of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, this involved starting with such basic geographical predictors as latitude, longitude, and whether or not each particular province was landlocked or had access to the seas and waterways. We also considered the role of these geographical patterns on macrohistorical dynamics of the plague in Italian history. We then traced these effects through demographic and biocultural variables including the frequency of the haplogroup R1b, immigration, and age structure, only then following the cascade through the prevalence of other respiratory diseases to their final COVID-19 mortality rate. Consequently, a macrohistorical and social biogeographical model considers the influence and interactions of the various types of ecology, in this case on COVID-19 mortality, while not limiting itself only to evaluating the impact of a particular variable over others.",

Bosker and collaborators (2008a) further distinguish between the concept of urban potential and foreign urban potential. The difference between these two metrics rests in the following distinction: whereas the concept of urban potential focuses on the populations of cities immediately surrounding the one being studied, foreign urban potential (FUP) focuses on a city's relative accessibility, based on transport routes and physical geography, through exclusion of the focal city's population size. Hence, FUP measures the density of a city's surrounding urban subsystem and, as a result, does not even correlate with city size (Bosker et al., 2008a) . This yields a variable that primarily captures a city's strength of access to outside markets, offering a superb assessment of its interconnectedness and likelihood of encountering high volumes of contact from foreign exchange and transport. For the current purposes, FUP data were collected per city from Bosker et al. (2008b) . We subsequently estimated average FUP scores per province for the 16th and 17th centuries.",

Before conducting the Growth Curve Analysis (GCA), the data were transposed into an array with each event assigned a timestamp from 1575 to 1656. Time was used as a predictor of the historical plague mortality (sorted by province) as part of a regression model. These estimations enabled the extraction of both historical plague intercepts and historical plague slopes from each regression model. This last procedure was performed using PROC REG in SAS v. 9.4. We also conduct a series of significance tests on these growth curve parameters, assessing whether or not the mean intercept, slope, and \"error\" (regression residual) terms were statistically different from zero.

This procedure comprises a series of Hierarchical General Linear Models, wherein the analyses incorporate several criterion variables generating a sequence that follows a hypothesized causal direction. Given that the criterion variables are hypothesized to have causal influences on each other, they are sequentially added as criterion variables to the overall set of regressions. Each prior criterion variable in this sequence is included as the first predictor in each subsequent regression step, generating a hierarchical system of equations, following a reverse causal order. This approach statistically controls for any potential indirect effects between the predictor and the criterion variables. Consequently, the model analyzes the direct influence of the predictor (X) upon the criterion variable (Y) in accounting for the indirect influence of the model's predictors through criterion variables tested in previous steps. This model is best represented by the following system of equations: Y3 = \u03b2 31 *X1 + \u03b2 32 *X2 + \u03b2 33 *X3",

To elucidate the possible causes of foreign pathogens in disproportionately impacting Northern and Central Italian macroregions above Southern and Insular ones, we looked into hypothesized differences between epidemic and endemic diseases through the inclusion of currently endemic infectious diseases which are transmitted similarly to COVID-19: tuberculosis, influenza, Table 2 Means and standard deviations for COVID-19 mortality rates, immigration per capita, GDP per capita, b-plagues, a-plagues, b-FUP, a-FUP. and bacterial pneumonia. To summarize, in evaluating hypotheses on the trends underlying the present COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, we collected reliable historical analogues to assess its similarity to other epidemics across time. For this, data on multiple plague epidemics were used. Data were examined for outbreaks spanning both the 16th and 17th centuries, including regional epidemics impacting Palermo and Venice from 1575 to 77, Sicily in 1624, Milan and several other Central and Northern regions from 1629 to 31, and Naples in 1656. These instances all occurred via the transmission of plague from non-local merchants or soldiers to Italian people who later returned to the affected region (Cliff et al., 2009) . This was especially the case in the early-to-mid 16th century, when the Italian Wars brought troops from throughout Western Europe to various regions of Northern Italy, verifiably spreading plague on multiple instances. Our present analysis considers this historical precedent by including potential contemporary forms of disease spread, such as transportation and immigration, in looking at the impacts of COVID-19. In attempting to explain these phenomena, we analyzed data for hypotheses on several relevant indicators, including (1) proportion of the population over 80 years of age; (2) population mobility between provinces and nations; (3) transportation (in terms of the number of train stations and airports in a province); (4) landlocked or coastal positioning; (5) provincial GDP per capita; and (6) and physical ecology (using altitude and latitude).",

These analyses have also reported that the density of a polity's urban system is associated with the severity of plague outbreaks in the past. Consequently, we explored the influence of historical FUP values (16th-17th centuries) upon historical plagues. Consistent with Bosker and colleagues' assessment (2008a) , the province's FUPs had a clear influence upon these epidemics, with FUP intercepts positively predicting a-Plagues. Moreover, findings from the GLM exploring any regional or macroregional variations on the rate of change of FUP suggest these values have persisted relatively unchanged over time. It follows then that, given this phenomenological persistence, contemporary outbreaks should follow a similar pattern.",

As predicted, the Northern macroregions displayed significantly higher plague intercept values compared to the South. Moreover, the GLM results, examining the influence of various ecological factors upon the present COVID-19 mortality rate, strongly suggest that geography remains a significant factor. Similarly, endemic respiratory diseases did not significantly predict the COVID-19 death rates, indicating that once a pathogen transitions to endemicity within a country, regional mortality variations are attenuated. In contrast, during epidemics regional and macroregional variations are expected to persist due to underlying population vulnerabilities such as the polity's degree of interconnectedness. This result indicates that above and beyond the provinces' FUP values, macroregional variation plays an essential role in the severity of both historical and contemporary epidemics.",

Although transportation had no significant effect, contemporary immigration had a significant positive effect on this criterion variable. We also examined the influence of population genetics on mortality. Previous publications have found a positive effect of R1b upon COVID-19 death rates. Consistent with these studies, the present study determined that this haplogroup predicted the criterion variable above and beyond the macroeregional differences. It is worth noting, however, that the percentage of the population carrying the R1b haplotype did not significantly predict either the plague intercepts or slopes. This indicates that the Y-chromosomal genetic structure of the Italian population plays little to no role in predicting historical epidemic mortality. The overall GLM results support the predicted temporal persistence of geographical factors, known to be associated with past historical outbreaks, upon present pandemics. Even though our models gave particular attention to indicators associated with community and social ecology (GDP per capita, immigration, the provinces' demographic structure, and mortality rates associated with endemic respiratory diseases), the lack of paleoclimatic data at the provincial level limited the present analyses. Future paleoclimatological and paleoepidemiological studies may consider exploring the influence of these indicators upon the reconstructed plague mortality rates among Italian provinces.",
