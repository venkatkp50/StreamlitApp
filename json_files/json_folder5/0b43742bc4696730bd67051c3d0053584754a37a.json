            "text": "In our case report, no severe adverse drug reaction was reported by the patient, suggesting a favourable safety profile, even for elderly patients. Two weeks after the tocilizumab infusion, the patient's neutrophil count was decreased slightly with no incidence of infection. However, Guaraldi et al., in their retrospective study, observed a significantly higher prevalence of infection in the tocilizumab group than in the standard-of-care group [14] . For that reason, Zhang et al. recommended a safety monitoring of tocilizumab use. Tocilizumab should be used with caution in patients with a neutrophil count < 2 \u00d7 10 9 /L, a platelet count < 100 \u00d7 10 3 /\u03bcL or liver transaminase above a 1.5-fold upper limit of normal. For patients with a neutrophil count < 0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L, a platelet count < 50 \u00d7 10 3 /\u03bcL or liver transaminase above a fivefold upper limit of normal, tocilizumab should be avoided [17] . Because our study is a case report, it has some limitations. However, to our knowledge, it is the first case report that describes the use of tocilizumab in a patient aged > 80 years with severe COVID-19. Unfortunately, elderly patients are often excluded from clinical trials while we need effectiveness and safety data in this population. All over the world, clinical trials with tocilizumab are still underway and should provide additional results [5] . The dose schedule of tocilizumab treatment remains to be validated, and more information is needed regarding which patients may benefit most from tocilizumab. This treatment is relatively expensive so for that reason eligibility criteria should be defined. There is currently no consensus on whether IL-6 level should be measured before and after tocilizumab treatment, nor whether CRP monitoring could be a good biomarker to assess the drug efficacy. Finally, clinical trial results would inform us whether tocilizumab should be associated with other therapeutic options such as corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs or antiviral agents.",
