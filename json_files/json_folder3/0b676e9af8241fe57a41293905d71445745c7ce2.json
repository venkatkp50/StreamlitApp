We conducted an open label, single center, phase III randomized controlled trial in Chennai, India comparing the safety and efficacy of Olanzapine and Metoclopramide for treating breakthrough CINV Methods Children aged 5-18 years receiving moderately/highly emetogenic chemotherapy were screened for the trial. Primary prophylaxis was a combination of Fosaprepitant/aprepitant with Ondanseteron and Dexamethasone. Patients were randomly assigned to the metoclopramide or olanzapine arm only if they developed breakthrough CINV. Primary end-point was patients who achieved complete response (CR): no vomiting or retching or nausea for 72 hours after the administration Results Eighty patients were analyzed (39-olanzapine arm and 41metoclopramide arm). CR rates were significantly higher in the olanzapine arm compared to the metoclopramide arm for vomiting (72% vs. 39%, P<0.001) and nausea (59% vs. 34%, P=0.026). Seven(17%) patients in the metoclopramide arm crossed over to the olanzapine arm in view of persistent G III/IV vomiting after drug administration and none crossed over in the olanzapine arm (P<0.001). The mean nausea score in the olanzapine arm was significantly lower(P=0.01). Hyperglycemia and drowsiness were more commonly seen in the olanzapine arm Conclusions Olanzapine is superior to metoclopramide for treatment of breakthrough CINV in children. No serious adverse events were observed with olanzapine or metoclopramide Introduction While vomiting is well controlled with current anti-emetic regimens, unrelieved chemotherapy-induced nausea (CIN) is a significant clinical problem. Limited information is available on the mechanisms that underlie unrelieved CIN. The purpose of this study was to evaluate for perturbed biological pathways associated with endocytosis and apoptosis in oncology patients who did (n=399) and did not report CIN (n=310) prior to their second or third cycle of chemotherapy (CTX).",

In this non-interventional registry, we explored whether 1) TF in cycle 1 (TF1) led to TF in cycle 2, 2) xTF in cycle 1 (xTF1) recurred in cycle 2, and 3) xTF rates differed between aprepitant + 5HT3 and NEPA (fixed combination of netupitant/ palonosetron). Methods NERO was a prospective, observational, multicenter, international study designed to assess complete response (CR: no emesis/no rescue) rates in pts receiving guideline-consistent versus -inconsistent antiemetic prophylaxis as a primary objective. This post-hoc analysis included only pts who received a guideline-based NK1 receptor antagonist-containing regimen prior to highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) or carboplatin for 2 cycles.

This study prospectively identified trends and risk factors in patient-reported pain associated with breast irradiation using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) and study-specific Skin Symptom Assessment (SSA). Methods Patients completed the ESAS and SSA at baseline (before RT), once a week during RT and up to 6 weeks after completion of RT, and 1-3 months post-RT. Patients who completed at least one assessment at each time point were included in the study. Results 426 patients were included for analysis. Overall pain increased significantly from baseline at weeks 1-2, week 5, and at 1-3 months post-RT (Table 1 ; p<0.001). Breast pain specifically increased significantly at weeks 1 and 2 (p<0.001) post-RT compared to baseline. Previous chemotherapy in mastectomy patients was associated with increased overall pain compared to mastectomy patients without previous chemotherapy ( Table 2 ; p=0.017). Younger patients (40-49 or 50-59 years of age) reported more overall pain (Table 3 ; p=0.038) and breast pain (p=0.0038) compared to patients \u226560 years of age. Conclusions Patient-reported pain associated with breast irradiation peaked 1 week after RT completion. These results provide support for closer monitoring of acute pain associated with breast RT in younger patients.",

Methods This is a prospective, single-group, interventional study. Cancer outpatients requiring an OR and receiving a MEDD of 60-300 mg were rotated to levorphanol using a ratio of 10:1 and assessed daily for 10-days. Successful OR was defined as a 2-point improvement in Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) pain score on day 10 or achieving the personalized pain goal between day 3-10. The ORR to levorphanol was calculated using net-MEDD (MEDD before OR minus the MEDD of the breakthrough opioid used along with levorphanol after OR). Results 40 patients underwent OR to levorphanol, and uncontrolled pain 35/40 (87.5%) was the most common indication ( Table 1 ). The median net-MEDD and levorphanol doses were 95 and 10 mg, respectively, and 33/ 40 (82.5%) had a successful OR with a median (IQR) ORR of 8.5 (7.5-10). Successful OR was associated with significant improvement in ESAS symptom scores and opioid side effect scale (Table 2 ). There was a strong association between MEDD and the daily dose of levorphanol (figure 1).",

In addition to the medical process of cancer, people with cancer might have psychological disorders too. Adjustment, depression, or anxiety disorder could become a comorbid diagnosis of cancer disease. Therefore, psychotherapy could be a necessity rather than a luxury for people with cancer. Literature showed that cognitive behavior therapy is one of the effective psychotherapy approaches during the cancer process. This paper reviews the definition of oncology and psycho-oncology with current statistics of cancer morbidity and mortality. To provide effective therapeutic support, this paper includes cognitive behavior therapy's techniques and a case formulation of a vicarious case who applied therapy during the prostate cancer process. Vicarious case presentation illustrates the clinically important information and implication process of the treatment plan. Further, to inform the readers about the way of implying effective techniques, this vicarious case shows the effective use of cognitive-behavioral therapy principles. ",

Background Higher levels of inflammation (like C-reactive protein, CRP) is a known associate of depression and anxiety, and is involved in the pathogenesis of CVDs. Furthermore, both cancer and cancer treatment including chemotherapy and radiation can lead to elevated levels of inflammation. We will therefore examine whether the relation between depression and anxiety with inflammatory markers among patients with either CVD or cancer is different from those with both conditions.",

The COVID-19 pandemic prompted worldwide stay-at-home orders and broad suspensions of elective medical and dental care to prevent risk of viral transmission. However, patients with cancer continued to require in-person care and active treatment for their disease. We herein report the clinical experiences of three oral oncology services at major cancer centers in Canada, the United States, and Brazil during the early period of the pandemic. Each center conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients seen by the oral oncology service from 6 weeks prior to, and 6 weeks after national declaration of stay-at-home orders. Patient visits were categorized as outpatient or inpatient, and as in-person or virtual. Each center adopted measures to minimize risk of COVID-19 transmission including screening for symptoms and isolating and testing screenpositive individuals and use of personal protective equipment. There was a reduction in visits during the study period, with a total of 3,154 visits during the 6 weeks prior to, and 1,531 in the following 6 weeks after stayat-home orders (reduction of 51.5%). Virtual visits increased from 1.4% to 17.3% of total visits, facilitating the provision of care for both established and new patients, allowing for effective triage of potentially urgent problems. Various strategies, often coordinated at the institutional level, were implemented to maintain essential oral oncology care during the COVID-19 pandemic. We anticipate many lessons learned from this experience that will improve access to oral oncology post-pandemic.",

There was an increase in study participants who endorsed feeling fearful, or helpless. Study participants when asked to rate their sleep quality, reported an increase in an inability to fall asleep and a decrease in the endorsement \"my sleep was not refreshing\". Persistent themes in the qualitative comments were feeling \"overwhelmed by the virus,\" or feeling \"lonely\"; especially in those women who lived alone or in more rural communities Conclusions These self-reported outcomes demonstrate how COVID-19 has affected self-reported symptoms, underscoring the importance of adding the impact of to the analysis of a longitudinal study. Nutrition during cancer treatment contributes to treatment tolerance and disease-related outcomes (Caillet 2017). Compromised nutrition is common in cancer patients. We hypothesized that the COVID-19 pandemic would worsen food insecurity (FI) in this population. An Internet-based survey was publicly available over 2 months (4-6/ 2020) on OncoLink.org. Adults diagnosed with cancer responded to queries about demographics, treatment variables, practical needs, and financial stressors. Questions surrounding FI included the ability to pay for food, fear of viral exposure from obtaining food, and ability to access food delivery. 249 cancer patients completed the survey; 89% Caucasian, 93% US residents, median age 60 (range 28-84). The most common diagnoses were hematologic (37%) and breast (23%) cancers. Half (51%) reported FI, most frequently due to fear of being exposed to COVID 19 (45%). Other barriers included delays in food delivery, difficulty finding needed items, and costs. One respondent was unable to access food because online platforms did not accept food stamps. Reduced access to food correlated with feeling more socially isolated (p=.0014) and compromised mental health (p<.00001). The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the ability of cancer patients to safely access food, potentially exacerbating the risk for malnutrition and impacting cancer treatment outcomes. While some aspects may have improved since the early pandemic, FI related to income and fear of exposure likely persists. Oncology treatment centers should be mindful of the risk of FI among cancer patients.",

Onco Partage association relies on health literacy and propose a specific program dedicated to personalized medicine. The project consists of an inventory of the knowledge of patients and caregivers through a mirror survey followed by a brainstorming and dedicated tools construction. Between May and June 2020, 92 responses to the survey pointed out a lack of knowledge of caregivers. Patient requests individual sessions about this fuzzy notion. Their information most often comes from nonprofessional sources and cannot decrease their anxieties. Brainstorming led to split the notion of personalized medicine into 5 axes. A common methodology to all axes was established. It involves a script with an adapted vocabulary; a validation by a scientific committee; a production of a video with a careful choice of images; a patient file, an interactive TPE; then training and educational pilots. Today the video of the first axis: \"What is a molecular test?\" is undergoing regional testing before a national distribution. The intrinsic value of the project is done using questions associated with the video. Precision medicine is a complex notion for patients but also for caregivers. After an inventory, we build a specific TPE to facilitate the task of caregivers and reduce patient anxiety\"",

In Japan, Long-term Care Insurance (LTCI) Law was implemented in 2000 and the insurance system was established to support the independence of the elderly by the entire society. It is a system that comprehensively evaluates their physical, mental, and social activities, i.e. geriatric assessment (GA) itself. However, this system has not been incorporated into cancer treatment. This system and cancer treatment has not worked in close cooperation with each other. We conducted a questionnaire survey to find the reasons why GA as well as cooperation of nursing and medical care is not implemented. Under the grant support by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare on \"Research on the infrastructure necessary to develop guidelines for cancer treatment of the elderly,\" The questionnaires were sent to 795 hospitals, and 631 departments in 340 hospitals responded to the survey. 81.5% did not perform GA. The common reasons for not conducting GA were lack of knowing GA (54.0%) and lack of personnel (35.5%). Even if GA was conducted, 63.6% did not utilize the results in clinical practice. 61.7% of the respondents were familiar with the LTCI as were 62.9% its certification process. 28% used LTCI assessment to some degree for treatment planning. The GA is less recognized than the LTCI, and its results are also rarely used in clinical practice. On the other hand, the results of LTCI certification were used in 28% for decision making on management. This survey found for the first time the incorporation of LTCI system into medical care in treating the vulnerable elderly cancer patients.",

Between November 2018 and January 2020, 88 people, 41 of whom were in the experimental group and 47 were in the control group, were included in the study. The standard approach of the hospital was applied to all patients. Nursing navigation was applied in addition to the patients in the experimental group. As a pre-test for all patients included in the study just before starting treatment; informed consent form, patient diagnosis form, CTCAE v5.0 toxicity criteria and EORTC QLQ-H & N35 quality of life scale were applied. It was observed that the severity of mucositis, pain in the mouth, dysphagia, and weight loss was statistically significantly decreased in the experimental group compared to the control group, and the quality of life scores were found to be significantly increased. As a result of this study, it was determined that navigation nursing is an effective approach for patients receiving head and neck radiotherapy.

            "text": "Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a lasting side effect of neurotoxic treatment. The identification of optimal CIPN measures is an urgent need. This study critically evaluated current approaches to CIPN assessment. Methods 859 cancer patients (54\u00b113 years) treated with neurotoxic chemotherapies were evaluated with patient reported outcome measures (PROMs EORTC CIPN20, FACT/GOG Ntx13), clinical grading (National Cancer Institute NCI grade, Total Neuropathy Score TNSc, nerve conduction) and sensory functional measures (monofilaments, 2-point discrimination, grating orientation, grooved pegboard). Convergent validity was assessed between measures and NCI grade as Spearman's correlation Taxanes are well known to cause chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). To date, there are no evidence-based measures to prevent CIPN. Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) is based on the application of (near)-infrared light on target tissue to stimulate cell repair processes. The aim of this trial is to evaluate if PBMT can prevent CIPN and enhance the patients' quality of life (QoL). A RCT with 31 patients with breast cancer that underwent taxane treatment was performed at the Jessa Hospital (Hasselt, Belgium). Patients were randomized to receive PBM or placebo treatments (2x/week) starting at first until the last week of their chemotherapy (CT). The patients' QoL was assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynaecologic Oncology Group NTX scale (FACT/GOG-NTX). These measures were collected at the first CT session, 6 weeks after the initiation of CT, at the final CT session and 3 weeks after the end of CT. Mixed ANOVA revealed a significant difference in the group by time interaction for the FACT/GOG-Ntx total score (p=0.031) with a higher overall score in the PBMT group. Questions of the FACT/GOG-Ntx regarding numbness in hands and feet were analyzed separately. A significant increase in the severity of numbness in hands and feet over time was observed in the control group (ps=0.000), whereas it remained constant in the PBMT group (ps=0.072). Based on preliminary results, PBMT seems to reduce the development of CIPN resulting in a better QoL. Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is a debilitating complication among colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors. Our aim was to investigate a wide array of sociodemographic, clinical, lifestyle, and psychological factors among CRC survivors to determine their associations with PN, and thereby, to give leads for interventions. In 1,516 all-stage CRC survivors (PROFILES registry), cross-sectional data were collected on PN (EORTC QLQ-CIPN20), sociodemographic (age, sex, education, employment, partner), clinical (time since diagnosis, tumor location, stage, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, PN-related comorbidities), lifestyle (alcohol, smoking, physical activity, body mass index), psychological factors (anxiety, depression, personality) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). After multiple imputation, correlates were analyzed with linear regressions and eliminated with backwards selection. CRC survivors (69 years; 42% female) were five years post-diagnosis, and 28-65% reported PN. PN was associated with older age, being male (sensory PN) or female (motor PN), shorter time since diagnosis, chemotherapy, osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, anxiety, depression, and worse scores on HRQoL domains, pain, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, constipation and financial problems. Sociodemographic, clinical, psychological and HRQoL factors were independently related to PN. Further research is required to examine whether adding psychological factors as targets to interventions can optimize PN outcomes and survivorship. ",

Empiric antimicrobial treatment was used in 100% of admissions, 45% were given therapeutic CSF, 7.5% received treatment despite having prophylaxis dosing within 14 days, 16.7% of the CSF treated group had a drop in neutrophils and delayed recovery, and 52.8% had a normal-to-elevated monocyte count on presentation. Conclusions Antimicrobial management was found to be within evidence-based recommendations. Use of CSF was found to be unwarranted at times and potentially harmful. Clear guidelines can mitigate this risk and further investigation to provide evidence is warranted. Neutrophil and monocyte correlation could be the direction to optimisation. ",

The easiest and least expensive way to manage IDA is the administration of iron salts orally; however, the feasibility of that approach has been questioned. We investigated whether the oral administration of iron to patients with AC and IDA was feasible. Methods Among patients with AC admitted to our SCU, we selected, over a oneyear period, those who presented with IDA (level of hemoglobin <11g/dl, serum iron <65\u03bcg/dl and transferrin saturation <20%).The patients received ferrous sulfate (525 mg/day) and were evaluated for compliance, adverse effects and biological response (hemoglobin and iron levels) over the following 2 weeks. Results From July 2018 until July 2019, 232 patients were admitted to the SCU. Among these, 18 (7.7%) were diagnosed with IDA, and 16 accepted to be included in the study. Only 2 out of 16 (12%) could be treated with oral iron for 2 full weeks; in the other patients, the discontinuation of iron therapy was justified by a worsening of clinical conditions (3 patients), major intolerance to oral iron (10) leading to transfusion or IV iron therapy, early discharge and loss for follow (5) or death (2) .

Invasive Aspergillosis (IA) remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality, stating the importance of using mold-active agents Methods This was a single-center, prospective, observational study which assessed AML patients undergoing induction chemotherapy and received prophylactic voriconazole between September 2019 and August 2020. The outcomes were compared with the historical data of similar patients who received fluconazole between September 2018 and August 2019 (n = 50). The dose of voriconazole was 200 mg orally twice a day Results Fifty patients with median age of 37 years (range 9-59 years) received voriconazole. Voriconazole reduced the incidence of proven/probable/ possible IFI (pppIFI) (16% vs. 38%; p = 0.023), the need to start therapeutic antifungals (34% vs. 76%; p = 0.000024) and delayed the mean time to the start of therapeutic antifungals (day 13 vs.10; p = 0.005), when compared to fluconazole.

Traditional RD assessment methods measure clinician-reported outcomes (CROs), but patient-reported outcomes (PROs) have gained recent popularity. The purpose of this prospective analysis was to compare PROs with CROs of breast RD. Methods Demographic and treatment characteristics were collected for patients receiving post-operative RT between February 2018 to September 2020. Patients and clinicians completed a skin symptom assessment at baseline, weekly during RT, and at a one-to three-month follow-up visit. Skin treatments used by patients were collected. Concordance between each PRO and CRO was determined using percent concordance and concordance index (C-statistic) by logistic regression analysis. Results A total of 777 patients were included (Table 1 ). All skin symptom assessment items were significantly underreported by clinicians in comparison to patients (p<0.0001), with a low to moderate level of concordance (Cstatistic range: 0.58-0.70; % concordance range: 29%-50%) ( Table 2) . Patients and clinicians, however, identified similar symptom trajectories over time (Figure 1 ).",

The results of this review will be presented to working group members through a Delphi consensus survey and recommendations will be included in the 2021 radiation dermatitis skin care guidelines. Introduction Steroid-refractory Graft-Versus-host disease (GVHD) is common after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Nutritional deficiency may occur as a complication due to factors including decreased dietary intake, medications, metabolic requirements, and gastrointestinal GVHD. Cutaneous eruptions due to nutritional deficiency can mimic cutaneous GVHD. Examination of nutritional status may identify an easily treatable intervention for refractory dermatitis. Methods 35 consecutive patients (24 male; 11 female) at Stanford Hospital and Clinics between January 2019 to December 2019 were referred to dermatology clinic for refractory dermatitis after allogeneic HCT. Bloodwork for 12 micronutrients were checked (vitamin A, B1, B2, B3, B6, B9, B12, C, iron, protein, zinc, selenium). Results 74.3% of all patients had deficiency in more than one micronutrient. Most common deficiencies were vitamin B6 (73% of patients), zinc (46.2%), vitamin C (38.5%), protein (26.9%), vitamin A (23%), iron (23%). Clinical improvement in skin dermatitis occurred within 3 days to 8 weeks with over the counter supplementation. Conclusions Mixed nutritional deficiency is common and underrecognized after allogeneic HCT, and can present with cutaneous manifestations that mimic refractory cutaneous GVHD. In cases of suspected GVHD with poor response to standard treatment, recognition and treatment of nutritional deficiencies may lead to improvement. Disclosures of Interest: non declared. ",

Overall survival (OS), time to progression (TTP), and progression-free survival (PFS) were calculated from ICI-BP onset to December 31, 2020 or death. An inverse probability weighting regression controlled for age, mucosal disease, CTCAE grade, ECOG status, and cancer stage. Results 35 ICI-BP cases (80% CTCAE grade 2+; mean 13.7 cycles to ICI-BP) were subdivided into SSB (n=11), SS (n=15), and NST (n=9). When adjusted for ICI cycles, preliminary OS analysis trended toward the SSB cohort having a reduced hazard of death (0.07 vs SS; 0.70 vs NST, p=0.06). The SSB cohort trended toward a reduced hazard of PFS (0.24 vs SS; 0.08 vs NST, p=0.12). No relationship was found between treatment and TTP (p=0.68). Conclusion Steroid-sparing biologics (i.e. dupilumab, omalizumab, rituximab) can be used to treat ICI-BP to avoid SS therapy without negatively impacting cancer outcomes. The sign of Leser-Trelat is a rare paraneoplastic cutaneous condition defined as sudden onset of multiple seborrheic keratoses in the setting of an underlying malignancy. It is well documented in gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and T-cell lymphomas. Cytokines and growth factors produced by cancer are thought to induce the rapid eruption of seborrheic keratoses. A literature review for 'Leser-Trelat' and 'nodular sclerosis Hodgkin lymphoma' (NSHL), revealed no previous reported cases of this disorder associated with NSHL. We are reporting the case of a 72-year-old man with treatment na\u00efve NSHL, presenting to the hospital with hematuria complicated with blood clots and multiple seborrheic keratoses covering his back. The seborrheic keratoses were monitored daily with photos and he was started on intravenous fluids (IVF) and continuous bladder irrigation (CBI). The patient's last visit with his dermatologist was five months prior to this hospitalization, before his diagnosis of NSHL, and did not reveal an impressive quantity of seborrheic keratoses. Intravenous fluids and CBI seemed to decrease the number of seborrheic keratoses, to the point that the seborrheic keratoses nearly resolved except for a few larger and more chronic lesions. We are hypothesizing that IVF and CBI have a dilutional effect on the cytokines and growth factors released from tumor cells. Patients who are bothered by the itchy symptoms or cosmetic looks of seborrheic keratoses can be offered this non-invasive treatment while they await definitive chemotherapy treatment.`O",

Thyroid function(TF) tests: TSH, free T3 and T4 blood levels; were realized in all patients treated with N. Test had no periodicity, depending on the oncologist and patient's previous TF. 6 patients presented hypothyroidism before N exposure: 5 treated with levothyroxine requiring close manage of TF during treatment, 4 of them increased doses. 1 patient with subclinical hypothyroidism started taking levothyroxine. 2 patients were diagnosed of N-related hyperthyroidism grade 1:one primary hyperthyroidism requiring beta-blockers and one subclinic hyperthyroidism. 5 developed hypothyroidism: subclinical in 4 cases:2 grade 1 (one required levothyroxine and the other TF monitoring) and two grade 2 (both required levothyroxine);one patient presented grade 2-3 primary hypothyroidism requiring levothyroxine, corticosteroids and N suspension until recovery. Conclusions Nivolumab-associated thyroid dysfunction (as hypo/hyperthyroidism) is an important AE. Having an standardized protocol about TF management would be convenient.",

However, due to a limited number of studies, small sample sizes and heterogeneity across study design, there is only limited evidence of effects of exercise among older patients with cancer during medical antineoplastic treatment.",

The pathogenesis is complex and multifactorial, with iron deficiency (ID) being a major contributor and potentially treatable with iron replacement. All patients should undertake an initial study on their iron kinetics and be evaluated during the course of treatments. Methods Retrospective and comprehensive study including 100 patients aged 40-88 years with solid tumors, that received chemotherapy (ChT) during 1 week of September at an oncology day-care unit at a hospital in Portugal. Data was obtained from patients' clinical process and analyzed by SPSSv25 Results 56% female; mean age 69\u00b112 years. The most common cancer type was breast cancer(32%), colorectal(32%), prostate(8%), and others. 56% had anemia (mean haemoglobin: 10.9\u00b11.1 g/dL), 79%: low grade anemia. None presented severe anemia. 7%: had the treatment postponed due to toxicity. Most patients in the anemic group(77%): stage IV, 39% having colorectal cancer. Of the 77%, 45% underwent an iron kinetics study and iron supplementation was given in 43% (34% orally, 9% intravenous (iv)). Conclusions Anemia is frequent in cancer patients, especially in those with gastrointestinal tumors, advanced stages and receiving ChT but, it often remains an overlooked and undertreated condition. Iv iron seems more effective in gastrointestinal patients. This study will suggest a protocol for screening Introduction Trabectedin was approved for the treatment of adult patients with advanced-stage soft tissue sarcomas.The purpose of this study was to comprehensively review available data on the safety and effectiveness of trabectedin use at Qatar Methods All patients who received trabectedin between November 1, 2015, and March 1, 2018, were reviewed. We evaluated the safety and effectiveness of trabectedin use. A total of 7 patients were identified. 3 of them didn't receive it due to a lack of financial support Results 1 patient received trabectedin for non-approved indications; metastatic ovarian cancer stage IV. And 3 patients received it as indicated for metastatic leiomyosarcoma & metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma. 1 patient stopped the medication after one cycle due to an increase in CEA 125 and transient hepatic toxicity, the next one had disease progression and developed a 12 % reduction in LVEF after 12 cycles, the third patient deceased, had disease progression after the 10th cycle that was received through peripheral line which resulted in extravasation and left arm cellulitis requiring debridement, The last one shifted to another line due to disease progression. All four patients had baseline ECHO and CPK, but no follow-up monitoring (table 1) . Conclusions Utilizing Trabectedin as indicated and performing the appropriate monitoring parameters can achieve maximum benefit with a manageable safety profile. Should be administered only through a central line, monitor LVEF every 2-3 months and CPK and LFTs levels prior to each administration of trabectedin",

To date, several scores for predicting the risk of VTE in patients with cancer have been developed. These include the Khorana, CONKO, and PROTECHT scores. This was a retrospective audit of 108 ambulatory oncology patients who developed VTE after starting chemotherapy. Data pertaining to patient, cancer, and treatment-related risk factors were collected. VTE risk scores were calculated and correlated with different risk factors and time to thromboembolic event (TTE) . The majority of VTEs were DVTs (54.7%) with proximally located being 85.2%. VTE were more likely to occur within the first year after commencing chemotherapy (69.4%), being more common in the first 6 months/180 days (48.1%). Nearly all VTEs occurred within 3 years (~89.8%). The shortest TTE was 8 days, with a median of 183.5 days. 83.3% of the events had been classified as low to intermediate risk (Khorana score 0 -2), while only 16.7% were high risk (3+). The Khorana score displayed poor sensitivity, predicting only 14.8% of VTEs. The PROTECHT score showed the best sensitivity (38.0%) of the scores tested. There was association between different ECOG performance statuses and time to thromboembolic event -with poorer performance status (i.e: higher ECOG score) correlating with a shorter TTE. Conclusion -None of the VTE scores have sufficient sensitivity to represent an ideal risk stratification tool for prescribing prophylaxis. While its sensitivity remains low, the Khorana score represents the best tool for risk stratification in cancer.",

Those patients who discontinued treatment died between 22 and 226 days after the last administration with a median of 37 days Conclusions The discotinuation of Ibrutinib was greater than that exposed in the pivotal trial and adverse events were the most common reason. The results indicate that the suspension of the drug is associated with poor prognosis. We consider necessary to assess the management of adverse reactions in a way that avoids the suspension of treatment. ",

Favourable survival rates highlight the need to better understand CRC survivors' experiences of long-term disease and treatment impacts. We aimed to develop a comprehensive survivorship PRO assessment model for CRC. Four databases were searched for: (1) longitudinal studies reporting pretreatment PRO predictors of survival in CRC or prevalence of PROs \u22651y post-treatment (PT); (2) qualitative studies reporting PROs >1y PT. Two reviewers independently assessed eligibility and extracted data. Metasynthesis was used to collate the evidence across studies.",

We investigated the association between feeding status and swallowingrelated QOL of HNC patients. 143 patients who finished HNC treatment completed the MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory. Functional feeding status was scored on the Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS). Relationships between these measures and patient and disease factors were analysed. Feeding status was associated with QOL (F(2,140)=35.2, p<0.001). Patients on regular diet (M=80.5\u00b112.9) had better QOL than those on tube feeding (M=63.4\u00b112.5, p<0.001) or modified diet textures (62.4 \u00b112.6, p<0.001). QOL did not differ between tube-fed patients and those on modified textures. Tumour site was associated with QOL (F(3,137)=4.9, p=0.003).

Other patient and disease factors showed weak or no association with QOL. QOL was not different in tube-fed patients and those on modified textures, while patients on regular diet had higher QOL.

This results in a profound, potentially life-long adverse impact on oral health and oral health-related quality of life. Goal To provide evidence-based recommendations for prevention and management of salivary gland hypofunction and xerostomia induced by non-surgical cancer therapies. Joint Guideline Approach Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer/International Society of Oral Oncology (MASCC/ISOO) and American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) convened a multidisciplinary Expert Panel to evaluate the evidence and formulate recommendations. PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were searched for randomized controlled trials published between January, 2009 and June, 2020. The guideline also incorporated two previous systematic reviews conducted by MASCC/ISOO, which included studies published from 1990 through 2008. Conclusions This clinical practice guideline provides direction for clinicians and patients making decisions for the prevention and management of salivary gland hypofunction and xerostomia induced by nonsurgical cancer therapies.

Platform's feasibility and patients' and HCPs satisfaction was assessed. Methods Patients from 18 Centers were invited to register at CureCancer, upload their files and symptoms and complete a questionnaire on demographics, disease and treatment characteristics and satisfaction. Results 159 patients were enrolled and 144 (90.6%) registered. 114 of 144 (79.1%), median age 54.5 years, completed the questionnaire. University and high School graduates were 99. 46 patients had metastatic disease, 87 received active treatment and 51 received supportive care. All patients also visited other non-oncology HCPs, with 47 visiting 2-9. Nineteen patients changed work or retired after cancer diagnosis and 49 had children below 24 years. Registration and file uploading were very easy for 98 (86.0 %) and 47 (41.2%) patients respectively. Over 80% of patients and physicians preferred the digital way. Easy data access, improved communication, feeling safe, treatment adherence, interventions from distance, particularly during the covid-19 pandemic, saving time and money, were highly commented by patients and HCPs. Conclusions CureCancer was feasible. Integration of CureCancer is expected to increase therapeutic success and reduce cancer costs, and map cancer disease characteristics and social/work/economic problems.

Their optimal management is essential to avoid inappropriate treatment discontinuation and offer a better clinical outcome. In 2019 an integrated care pathway between Endocrinology and Supportive Care Service (SCS) Units have been created. Patients (pts) starting TKIs or ICIs or pts developing ETs from them have been addressed from SCS to a dedicated \"endocrino-oncology\" outpatient service (EOOS) for appropriate diagnosis and treatment in a strict oncologist/endocrinologist collaboration.MethodsWe considered all pts who accessed the EOOS and we evaluated their clinical characteristics, the access reason and the rate of discontinuation of the oncologic therapies. Results 94 pts accessed the EOOS. 57 pts performed their first access at baseline, while 37 pts had their first visit because of an ET. 88%) adrenal insufficiency. 50 pts (98.04%) did not discontinue their treatment, while only 1 (1.96%) pt with hypophysitis permanently discontinued her treatment.ConclusionsThe appropriate treatment of pts developing ETs from TKI or ICI brought to a very low discontinuation rate and, possibly, to a better oncologic outcome. A dedicated EOOS that collaborates with the SCS unit should then be recommended in every cancer centre.MODEL-04 COST ANALYSIS OF TOPIC INTERVENTIONS AND QUALITY OF LIFE RELATED TO RADIATION DERMATITIS: EORTC QLQ-C30; QLQ-H&N43 AND SKINDEX 29 OUTCOMES.",

The reason for visiting the EC was cancer-related in 45.7% and treatment-related in 45.7%. Of the head and neck cancer patients who visited the EC, 68.6% survived for more than 12 months. According to the logistic regression test, each time the HS-CRP variable increased by 1, the probability of an emergency room visits increased significantly, 1.004 times. (P=0.043) Conclusions Patients undergoing treatment for head and neck cancer have significant unplanned visits to the EC. The main reason for visiting the emergency room is uncontrolled pain. HS-CRP is evaluated as a good marker for predicting un expected EC visits.MODEL-35 DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF \"ADVANCED CANCER SHARED CARE LETTERS\" TO IMPROVE SHARED CARE BETWEEN ONCOLOGISTS AND FAMILY PHYSICIANS",

National benchmarking identified a need for a proactive PT model. The study used a Prospective Surveillance Mode of Care (PS-MoC) to investigate feasibility of delivering a comprehensive PT intervention. Methods Mixed methods explanatory sequential design, children 4-18 years within three months of first cancer diagnosis. Intervention included education, surveillance (screening physical function), early detection (standardised assessment), exercise (supervised and independent) and physical activity promotion (fitness tracker). Results N=14 participants (94% of those eligible) completed the study with no adverse events. 100% of parent-proxies strongly agreed the PS-MoC should be available to all children on treatment and 85.7% rated overall experience provided by the PT as excellent. The personal attributes of PT in engaging and motivating participation was identified as a theme. Post exercise intervention average Six Minute Walk Test increased 115 metres (p=0.015), average Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL 4.0) Physical Function domain increased (29.8% vs 46.2% p=0.013), dorsiflexion ankle range of motion stayed within normal limits as did overall motor performance Movement Assessment Battery for Children-Second Edition (MABC-2).ConclusionsThe PS-MoC was feasible, with excellent acceptability, experience and satisfaction by participants.

However, it is included in the Children's Oncology Group Long Term Follow-up Guidelines because of the importance in survivorship care. Paediatric haematology/oncology patients are at high risk for inadequate vitamin D levels due to a range of factors including primary cancer diagnosis, medication known to impair Vitamin D absorption or action, such as glucocorticoids and methotrexate, and malnutrition. Vitamin D insufficiency has short and long term negative impact on bone health. Low bone density, osteoporosis and osteonecrosis have been reported. The objective of this clinical prospective observational study is to determine if vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency is common in newly diagnosed paediatric haematology/oncology patients in New Zealand. Methods Newly diagnosed haematology/oncology patients aged between 2-19 years, enrolled within 14 days following diagnosis.ResultsRecruitment started mid-summer. We currently enrolled 7 patients and 57% had an inadequate level of vitamin D. 2 patients had vitamin D deficiency (<30nmol/L) and 2 patients had vitamin D insufficiency (<50nmol/L). Conclusions Vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency is common in this population. We recommend incorporating screening for vitamin D insufficiency as part of standard of care for newly diagnosed paediatric haematology/oncology patients.PEDIA-09 HIGH-INTENSITY END-OF-LIFECARE IN PEDIATRIC CANCER PATIENTS.

Massimino 1 1 Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Pediatric Oncology Unit, Milan, Italy 2 Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Clinical Psychology Unit, Milan, ItalyIntroductionDespite improvements in survival, cancer remains the leading cause of non-accidental death in children and adolescents, who risk receiving high-intensity end-of-life (HI-EOL) care. We focused on treatments for relapses (particularly in the last weeks of life), assessing their impact on the end-of-life. Moreover, we identified patients most likely to receive HI-EOL care, and examined whether palliative care services can contain the intensity of EOL care. Methods This retrospective study considered patients treated at the Pediatric Oncology Unit of the Istituto Nazionale Tumori (INT) in Milan, who died between 2018 and 2020. The primary outcome was HI-EOL care, defined as \u22651 cycle of intravenous chemotherapy <14 days before death, or \u22651 hospitalization in intensive care in the last 30 days of life, or \u22651 emergency room admission in the last 30 days of life.ResultsWe enrolled 68 patients, 18 (26.5%) of them received HI-EOL care. Patients given specific in-hospital treatments in the last 14 days of their life more frequently died in hospital. Those given aggressive EOL care were less likely to die at home or in hospice. Patients with CNS tumors were more likely to have treatments requiring hospitalization, and to receive HI-EOL care.ConclusionsIt is essential to consider specific treatments at the end of life with caution. Treatments should be administered at home whenever possible. Early activation of palliative care, especially for fragile and complicated patients like those with CNS cancers, could help families cope with the many problems they face. In order to optimise the sleep of children & young people with cancer, it is important to first understand how CYP, families, and healthcare professionals (HCPs) perceive the impact of poor sleep Methods 15 CYP (aged 6-19 years), their families, and 24 HCPs were asked to describe \"the impact of poor sleep on patients\" through interview or free text responses Results Poor quality sleep affected CYP's mood: patients became more irritable, easily frustrated, & avoided social interactions. Emotional resilience to cope with difficult news about prognosis or treatment was decreased. Physical health was impacted: CYP were too tired to take part in rehabilitation & therapies. Nutrition also suffered: CYP had poorer appetites or missed meals & snacks because they were asleep during the day. Patients and professionals felt that recovery times were longer & healing was delayed. A combination of low mood & physical fatigue meant that CYP were less engaged & less able to participate in planned activities, therapeutic consultations, & social activities on the ward. Poor",

The purpose was to: 1) describe self-directed OM visit patterns; and 2) determine if OM reduced anxiety at first visit and across all visits controlling for demographics. Methods From Jan. 2015-June 2019, a consecutive, retrospective sample reported anxiety before and after OM from 0=no anxiety to 10=worst possible anxiety at an academic hybrid, multi-site, community-based cancer institute. Descriptive statistics summarized demographics, visit patterns, and anxiety. A paired t-test compared pre-to post-anxiety at the first OM visit and a variance component model evaluated anxiety across all visits. Results 749 patients attended 2,666 visits. 428 (57.1%) recorded \u2265 two visits. Therapy patterns were diverse (i.e., days between first and second visits, days between subsequent visits, and OM duration). The mode days between visits was seven, consistent with therapist recommendations.(Table 1). Anxiety was significantly decreased after the first (p<0.01) and across all visits (p<0.01) (Table 2).ConclusionsThis study suggests nonpharmacologic OM provides immediate, predictable anxiety reduction. OM utilization varied widely in the largest outpatient study of patient-directed OM use. Future research should examine the impact of utilization patterns on anxiety response to OM.YOGA FOR DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS IN PEOPLE WITH CANCER: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS M.

The aim of this review was to evaluate the effect of yoga-based interventions on depression and anxiety symptoms in people with cancer in randomized controlled trials. Methods 6 databases were searched and systematic review procedures were followed including a quality assessment. Meta-analysis of suitable studies was conducted.Results 26 studies were eligible for inclusion for depressive and 16 for anxiety symptoms. Meta-analyses revealed evidence for significant medium effects of yoga on depression symptoms (N=1,486, g=-0.419, 95% CI=-0.558 to -0.281, p<0.001) and anxiety (N=977, g=-0.347, 95% CI=-0.473 to -0.221, p<0.001) compared to controls. Subgroup analyses for depressive symptoms revealed significant effects for all analyses (type of cancer, type of control, treatment status, duration of intervention, frequency of yoga sessions), effect sizes being comparable between subgroups. Similar findings were found for anxiety symptoms except for treatment status, where the only significant effect was found when yoga was delivered during active treatment.ConclusionsThis review found evidence for moderate clinical effectiveness of yoga for anxiety and depression symptoms in people diagnosed with cancer. These findings support the need for further investigation of the effect of yoga on mental health symptoms across a variety of cancers.PSYCH-05 Oral Proffered Paper: IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF SELF-MANAGEMENT SUPPORT IN AMBULATORY CANCER CARE: A MIXED-METHOD STUDY OF ORGANIZATIONAL READINESS AND B A R R I E R S / E N A B L E R S F O R T A I L O R I N G IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES TO MULTI-SITES",

Young adults (YAAdCa):18-34 years-old, Adults (AAdCa): 35-64 years old, and Elderly (EAdCa):>64 years old. Using the ESAS-FS, determined the frequency, and correlates of self-reported Spiritual Pain (SP)(pain deep in your soul/being that is not physical) and Anxiety and Depression and other symptoms. Psycho-spiritual distress defined as SP \u22651/10, Anx\u22652/ 10, and Dep\u22652/10.ResultsTotal 4331 pts. 53% female, 71% White, 11% African-American, 6%Hispanics. 211/4331(5%) were YAAdCa, 2380/4331(55%) AAdCa, and 1740/4331(40%) EAdCa. SP was present in 69/211(33%) in YAAdCa vs. 940/2380(39%) in AAdCa vs. 563/1740(32%) in EAdCa, p<0.0001. Anxiety in 63%, vs. 60%, vs. 53% per group respectively, p<0.0001. Depression in 38%, vs. 49%, vs. 53% per group respectively, p<0.0001. Psycho-spiritual distress was present in 22%, vs. 26%, vs. 21% per group respectively, p<0.0001. Logistic regression showed pain correlated with higher psychospiritual distress (OR: 0.97, p=0.02), Well-Being OR:1.153 p<0.0001, shortness of breath OR:1.1, p<0.0001, and Financial Distress OR:1.2, p<0.0001. Conclusions High prevalence of Anxiety, Depression and Spiritual-Pain in all age groups of AdCa. The presence of psycho-spiritual distress is significant among different age groups.

Ghorbel 1 1 Salah Azaiez Institute, Medical Oncology Department, Tunis, TunisiaIntroductionTracheostomy causes physical changes and psychological disturbances . This is the first repost in Tunisia on tracheostomy related self esteem and psychiatric disorders in cancer patients.MethodsThe total sample included 100 cancer patients undergoing tracheostomy between 2015 and 2019 .The data have been collected by using Rosenberg Self-esteem scale (RSES) and the General Health Questionnaire GHQ-12. Results 92 patients were males with a mean age of 61 years. 48 were treated for a laryngeal tumor and 2 for hypopharyngeal tumor. 77% were tracheotomized in emergency and definitively. Regarding RSES, 19% of patients have a very low self-esteem ,34% of them have a low selfesteem, for 13% of them the self-esteem is average, for 22% it is strong and finally for 12% of them it is very strong. Thus, 53 % of the patients have a self-esteem below average. This score is lower with a statistically significant difference in the female sex (p = 0.017), in the unemployed (p = 0.027) and between the different stages of the disease with a lower score at the metastasis stages (p = 0.013) .This sample shows no difference between the marital status (p = 0.06).For the of GHQ-12 ,60% of patients have a psychiatric disorder with a score higher or equal to 2 , there is more psychological disorder in single patients (p = 0.003) and metastatic stage (p = 0.01).

Milbury 2 1 The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Behavioral Science, Houston, United States 2 MD Anderson Cancer Center, Behavioral Science, Houston, TX, United StatesIntroductionWomen with lung cancer are particularly vulnerable to psychological distress and social isolation. Therefore, we examined the feasibility and acceptability of a group-based telehealth psychosocial intervention for this understudied population.MethodsWomen with a recent diagnosis (3 mo) of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) completed computer literacy measures and were randomized to a group-based telehealth psychosocial intervention: coping skills or attention control (AC). Both arms consisted of five, 60 min. sessions (Zoom video conference). Groups of 3-5 members were led by a masters-level clinician. After the final session, patients rated experience of intervention delivery and telehealth platform.ResultsSeventy patients (mean age=66 yrs, 54% >65 yrs; 71% non-Hispanic White; 50% college educated; 75% advanced stage) consented (63% consent rate) and 65 were randomized. At baseline, 47% of patients reported daily computer use and 50% said they rarely or never use a computer. 63% of patients attending all sessions (means: interven-tion=3.18; AC=3.56). Across arms, 89% preferred group delivery and 92% preferred online delivery. Regarding the Zoom platform, 71% said it was easy to use, 65% would recommend it to others, and 41% felt comfortable after one use. Only 44% thought telehealth was the same as it would have been in-person.ConclusionsThe present findings suggest the feasibility and acceptability of delivering a group-based psychosocial intervention via telehealth for middle to older aged women with NSCLC undergoing treatment.PSYCH-21 THE MODERATING ROLE OF PERCEIVED SOCIAL SUPPORT ON SYMPTOMS AND DISTRESS IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC MYELOID LEUKEMIA H. Lee 1 , N. Patel 1 , S. Lee 1 , E.Burns 1 , K. Yeager 1 1 Emory University, Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing, Winship Cancer Institute, Atlanta, United StatesIntroductionCancer patients undergoing treatment often experience a significant level of distress, which can be associated with symptoms. Social support may help relieve symptom-related distress. We examined moderating effects of social support on the symptom-distress relationship in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients taking tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Methods This cross-sectional study measured symptoms (PRO-CTCAE\u2122 Composite grade, range 0-3), distress (NCCN DT, range 0-10), and social support (ISEL-12, range 0-36). Linear regression-based moderation analysis was used.ResultsPatients (n=62; 50% White; 56% male) aged 52\u00b115 years (range19-84). Over 50% of patients experienced fatigue, aching muscles, diarrhea, pain, numbness/tingling in hands/feet, and aching joints. Patients overall had a positive perception of social support (ISEL-12=28\u00b17) and clinically elevated distress (DT=4\u00b13). The presence of fatigue (\u03b2=2.3), aching muscles (\u03b2=1.8), pain (\u03b2=2.2), aching joints (\u03b2=1.5), and sad/unhappy feelings (\u03b2=2.2) significantly increased distress levels, adjusting for covariates. Moderating effects of social support were not statistically significant, but a high level of social support reduced the adverse effect of aching joints on distress. Conclusions Increased distress in CML patients was related to symptoms during treatment, and social support may alleviate this distress. Assessment of social support should be treated as part of symptom management for CML patients taking TKIs.IntroductionPatient-reported outcomes (PROs) to support patients reporting symptoms to healthcare professionals (HPs) has been shown to improve patient outcomes. There currently isn't an Upper Gastrointestinal Cancer (UGIC) specific PRO tool for patients to self-report symptoms in real-time allowing for delivery of supportive care to be integrated into clinical care. Methods Co-design methodology with patients, carers and HPs was used to develop a UGIC specific PROs tool. The co-designed tool will be used to report real-time PROs within the PROpatient trial. 65 UGIC-specific PROMs were presented to HP and consumer focus groups to determine relevance, impact and actionability of symptoms. Focus group results were used to develop a survey sent to patients on the UGIC registry, requiring patients to identify and rank their ten most commonly experienced symptoms. Frequency of responses to PRO items were analysed and weighted to finalise the tool. Results 50% of consumer participants agreed that all symptoms were relevant, actionable and impacted patients' quality of life and should be included in the PRO tool, the remaining 50% believed the tools length was burdensome for patients leading to a short PRO tool being developed. 169 completed surveys were received from UGIC patients, the highest ranked, frequently reported symptoms were included in the UGIC specific PROs tool.ConclusionsThe study developed a co-designed UGIC-specific PROs tool for patients to provide real-time reporting to HPs to guide supportive care within the PROpatient trial, providing optimal supportive care.PSYCH-23 WHICH PATIENTS NEED PSYCHOSOCIAL SUPPORT FOR THEIR CANCER-RELATED REDUCED ABILITY TO EAT?

The relationship of caregivers were: partner (n=8), parent (n=3), child (n=1), sibling (n=1) or friend (n=1). Two universal sources of distress emerged across the cancer trajectory: provision of care (e.g., insufficient information, communication and uncoordinated transitions in care) and fear of the unknown (e.g., diagnosis, test results, check-ups). Financial burden and physical comfort was most evident during treatment and into survivorship.ConclusionsOngoing efforts to mitigate the effects of caregiver distress are necessary. Ensuring carers are well-informed about care and well-supported to manage what may lay ahead throughout the often longitudinal path of cancer may contribute to lowering distress.PSYCH-34 SEXUAL HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN DE NOVO HORMONE-SENSITIVE METASTATIC PROSTATE CANCER PATIENTS IntroductionTreatments with antiandrogen-deprived therapy (ADT), Chemotherapy, and Inhibitors of the Androgen Receptor Pathway (IARP), prolonging survival in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). However, less data in exploring QoL in De novo mHSPC.MethodsThe semi-qualitative and quantitative study enrolled mHSPC at Ramathibodi hospital from Aug 2019 to Oct 2020. Patients will be assessed for QoL and erectile dysfunction (ED) in pre/posttreatment via telephone interviews, questionnaires by EuroQoL-D (EQ-5D) and International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5). Analysis using questionnaire and patients interviews were recorded, transcribed, and organized thematically analyzed. Results 8 men were enrolled with a median age was 68 years old and all were high-volume diseases.62.5% were severe ED,and 37.5% were moderate ED.After treatments,patients had improved QoL but worsening in ED symptoms by IIEF-5 (IIEF-5 7.125 to 5.62; P=0.01). Qualitative analysis revealed 3 primary themes:(1) Perception of disease and treatment: patients feel that treatment significantly impacts their body image and declines sexual functions. Most still had good sexual intimacy, but all had a loss of libido after ADT.(2) Value of ADT: patients prioritize cancer treatments than worrying about AEs of ADT.(3) Lack of support during treatments: no doctors initiated in talking about the patients'sexual problems.ConclusionsCombination ADT and IART improving the QoL but worsening sexual function. Care for sexual health needs is fully integrated into oncology care for prostate cancer patients.PSYCH-35 PATIENT EXPERIENCE OF SCALP COOLING FOR THE P R E V E N T I O N O F C H E M O T H E R A P Y -I N D U C E D ALOPECIA (CIA) IntroductionChemotherapy-induced alopecia (CIA) is one of the most distressing physical side effect of chemotherapy treatment. Scalp cooling is the only safe and effective option for CIA prevention/reduction. The development of machine-based scalp cooling devices, together with mounting clinical efficacy and safety evidence, have contributed to the recent increased acceptance and implementation of scalp cooling internationally. Here, patient experience of scalp cooling is analysed to identify the impact access to effective scalp cooling treatment has for patients.",

We aimed to investigate independency in ADL level and its' association with quality of life level in hospitalized cancer patients. Methods Cancer patients (n=34) receiving treatment at Hacettepe University Oncology Hospital were included. The Barthel Index was used to assess ADL level. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) was used to assess quality of life. Results Patients had different cancer diagnosis (lung cancer (n=9), breast cancer (n=6), lymphoma (n=5), other(14). The reasons were hospitalization include supportive care (n=19), cancer treatment (n=15). Recorded outcomes were showed inTable 1. Moderate and positive correlation was found between the Barthel total score and EORTC QLQ-C30 functional score (r=0.673, p\u02c20.001). There was moderate and negative correlation between Barthel total score and EORTC QLQ-C30 symptom score (r=-0.448, p=0.013).ConclusionsThere was severe dependency in terms of ADL in hospitalized cancer patients. It was thought that cancer patients need supportive care for maintenance of ADL during hospitalization. Moreover, by increasing independency in ADL, patients' QOL are also positively affected.

Morrow1  1  University of Rochester, Surgery, Rochester, United States Background Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the U.S, accounting for about 25% of all cancer mortality. Low dose computerized tomography (LDCT) scanning can detect lung cancer at earlier stages, thus improving clinical outcomes. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends annual screening for lung cancer using LDCT scanning for high-risk individuals (aged 55-80 years who have a >30 pack-year smoking history). The objective of this study is to examine disparities in lung cancer screening uptake among high-risk individuals in the U.S. MethodsIntroductionSince 2007, the Journal of Cancer Survivorship (JCSU) has published hundreds of papers to advance cancer survivorship care and science across the globe. This study aimed to provide an analysis of papers published by the JCSU from March 1st, 2007 until December 31, 2020. Methods Characteristics (locations, study type, cancer type, original author assigned keywords) of all included articles were extracted, coded and analysed bibliometrically using a range of programs including EndNote X9, NVivo v.R1.3, and VOSviewer, v.1.616. Journal Impact Factor and citation counts of each manuscript were downloaded from Clarivate Journal Citation Reports and Scopus\u00ae respectively.ResultsPublished papers are predominantly from the USA, Australia, and the United Kingdom. While breast cancer is the dominant cancer type, a range of different cancer types and populations with mixed-cancer types have been addressed. Cross-sectional designs were the most used. JCSU's impact experienced steady growth between2011-15 and stabilized recently (2016-20), at 3.296(1-year) and 3.830 (5-year). Keyword co-occurrence analyses indicated prominent themes including quality of life, physical activity, late effects, follow-up care, and psychosocial aspects of cancer survivorship. Conclusions JCSU has made a significant contribution by disseminating knowledge in cancer survivorship. This study provides insight into JCSU's success to date and recommends further diversification and directions for practice areas that are novel or have received less attention by the cancer survivorship community.",

Music therapy that was tailored to the culture of patients has been used to manage pain in different patient populations. However, the cultural elements of music in relation to pain management in the Nigerian care setting especially among women with breast cancer undergoing mastectomy remain underexplored. Thus, this study aims to explore the cultural elements and genre of music suitable for postmastectomy pain among Nigerian women Purposive sampling was used to recruit 17 participants who have undergone mastectomy. Data was collected through in-depth interview at the surgical out-patient clinic and female surgical ward. Data collection was continued till data saturation was reached. Inductive data analysis was used, and the concepts were organized into themes. The mean age of participants was 53.2 \u00b1 13.4. Five main themes emerged from this study; pain experience after mastectomy, music as an embodiment of culture and lifestyle, getting something out of music, perception of music as a therapy for pain management after mastectomy and innovative ways to adopt music therapy. From the participants' experience with pain management in this study, knowledge about music as a form of therapy for pain management remains inadequate. However, they perceived that music that considers cultural elements (language, religion and meaningfulness) would be effective for reducing pain after mastectomy.",

We report the largest cohort of longterm cancer survivors with RIC, and the first series of long-term surveillance using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with highly sensitive susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI). Methods Eligibility required long-term cancer survivorship, and RIC seen on MRI-SWI. RIC number and size were reported on Baseline and last Follow-up MRI-SWI. MRI-SWI were centrally reviewed. Results 113 cancer survivors were eligible. At CRT, median age was 9.3 years, median dose was 50.4Gy, median time to Baseline MRI-SWI was 17.9 years. Median follow-up from Baseline MRI-SWI was 7.4 years. On Baseline MRI-SWI, 89% of survivors had multiple RIC; >10 RIC in 34%; RIC \u22654mm in 65%. On Follow-up MRI-SWI, 96% of survivors had multiple RIC; >10 RIC in 62%; RIC \u22654mm in 72%. Of the 109 (96%) with asymptomatic, screening-detected RIC, 96% remained free from RIC-related symptoms at 10 years. Only two (2%) required neurosurgical intervention for RIC. No RIC-related mortality. Conclusions RIC are typically asymptomatic: neurological sequelae are infrequent, and neuro-surgical intervention is rare. Serial MRI-SWI reveals RIC to be commonly multiple, and progressive in size and number. We suggest screening MRI-SWI is unlikely to influence longer term intervention for RIC; and asymptomatic RIC are insufficient indication for MRI-SWI surveillance in long-term cancer survivors with past CRT.

Results 85.3% were \"very satisfied\" or \"satisfied\" (11,9%) with the way their questions were addressed during consultations. The patients received sufficient information e.g on side-effects and valued discussions on selfmanagement strategies. All patients found that the discussed topics were highly relevant. They believed that the nurses applied a holistic approach, and they felt safe and strengthened to cope with their situation. An increasing number of symptoms were managed, for example vagina dryness, hot flushes and sleep disturbances Conclusions Nurse-led consultations for patients with breast cancer or gynecological cancer have been implemented and resulted in a more systematic approach to symptom management and optimal utilization of skills and competencies for both physicians and specialised nurses. Purpose To assess patient and caregiver self-efficacy for managing treatment side effects and caregiver preparedness, and to explore nutrition-related challenges. Methods Individuals with gastrointestinal cancer and their caregivers completed structured surveys and in-depth interviews. Cancer treatment side effects, patient and caregiver self-efficacy, and caregiver preparedness were measured. In-depth interviews explored nutrition-related challenges and supportive care needs. Descriptive statistics were calculated. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using inductive and deductive thematic analysis. Results 58 individuals with GI cancer (42% female, 97%>55 yrs) and their caregivers (59% female, 85%>55 yrs) completed study activities. Caregivers reported lower self-efficacy for managing side effects (57.25 \u00b125.82) than patients (70.83\u00b119.12: 10-100 scale). Caregiver preparedness score was 2.27 \u00b1 0.72 (0-4 point scale); problem areas were identified, including emotional needs, fluctuating eating habits, advanced disease progression and making care activities pleasant. Five themes emerged from patient interviews: dietary change, resiliency, control, familial support, individuality. Eight themes emerged from caregiver interviews: preparedness, self-care, discordance of nutrition practices, role reversal, managing patient, dietary awareness, family interaction, patience. Conclusions Nutritional beliefs, behaviors, and challenge were identified as themes for behavioral nutrition interventions and risk assessment for cancer caregivers and survivors. ",

Introduction PROFILES (Patient Reported Outcomes Following Initial treatment and Long term Evaluation of Survivorship) is an infrastructure for measuring patient-reported outcomes (PRO). The aim is to share its best practices and the broad range of achievements. Methods PROFILES started in 2004 and was digitalized in 2010. PRO data are longitudinally collected from diagnosis up to 20 years into survivorship. Measures include e.g. Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), comorbidity, lifestyle (smoking, alcohol, physical activity), sleep and return to work. Results of the PRO assessments are fed back to the patient and health care provider. PROFILES is linked to the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Novel developments are collection of biomarkers, dietary intake and patient-reported symptoms.",

Methods An anonymous online questionnaire was sent to 160 participants (\u226518 years; pancreatic cancer diagnosis), and a focus group was held in May 2020 to examine aspects of trial delivery. For example, when and by whom information on exercise trials should be delivered, frequency and setting of the intervention, and barriers/ facilitators to exercise. Responses were analysed thematically, findings verified and discussed within the research team and subsequent changes made to the trial. Results 19 participants completed the questionnaire and 6 took part in the focus group. 84% had received surgery followed by chemotherapy (n = 21). The majority were female (n = 20, 80%). The most cited barriers to exercise were fatigue (37%), and pain (26%).
