Um, I'm aware of all the risks and all the damages, but I just kept having this like sort of obsessiveness or urge or whatever, like, I want to smoke a cigarette. I feel like that'll make me feel better. Um, so she, uh, was trying to like look out for me, and we-we talked about it a lot, and we did a lot of research, and I decided that, um, the harms were a lot less, and I could start with non-nicotine juice, and that it would give me that sort of act of smoking without any of the nicotine, or any of the, um, the tobacco, uh, toxins or anything like that. So that was, I think, that was mostly what motivated me, is I didn't want to start smoking, even though I wanted to, but I didn't want to, you know?",

            "text": "And then like when buying my first, um, vape or-or second, I still got a lot of shit from-from my friends about it. Um, but I guess itit changes a lot when they realise that I'm not doing it just 'cause I wanna vape, they wanna, I wanna do it 'cause of the tricks and everything.... And so they were very against it first, and then when I bought it and started doing stuff, they were all like that's amazing, I wanna do it now.Managing stigma Violet: I guess it feels like I'm doing something that not many people in my demographic do, which is always uncomfortable because then it's kind of like every time you do it, you have to justify it if you are with people. So I tend to do it a lot more at home.... Um, it's not really like, uh, I don't know. Like, I ... I guess I'm not of the Int:And what's not real about an e-cigarette do you think, to these people? Bailey: Yeah, it must just be the ... They might just know that it's a plastic, think that it's plastic .. Um, so it might just be the physicality of it. Uh, the way it feels. Gerry: I guess it might be viewed as an unpleasant thing to do. Iain: I think there's still a lot of stigma...amongst regular smokers about seeing people vape... Theme: Stimulation and engagement Sub-themes Flavours Int: Were there other parts of the experience that you enjoyed? Gerry: Um ... Just the flavour, I suppose\u2026. I find it relieves stress. Int: Mm-hmm (affirmative). How did it relieve stress for you? Gerry: I guess it's just like when you're stressed and you get lollies. It's kind of that ... Iain: if you've got one that's got a terrible flavour, it's almost unusable because it's just, it can leave a really horrible taste in your mouth and one thing that my girlfriend complains about now is if I'm sitting there puffing on it all day like I tend to do sometimes, if the vapour gets a little burnt, it leaves a really bad smell in the room....so it's quite unpleasant if you've got a bad flavour. Joseph: I would just go through a bottle each day, just 'cause I enjoyed the flavour, so I'd keep on using it. Um, whereas at least with the nicotine it ... After using it to a, to a point, I will start to feel it and I will start to sometimes even feel ill, so that kinda limits how much I use it. Joseph: You can try different flavours, you can ... You know, eh, it's all the flavours, you're, you're not necessarily eating stuff and you can be Puff the Magic Dragon. Leonie: I feel like even if I have a favourite now, it changes. You know. Um, I guess at the moment, I have one that tastes like gummies, like specifically a peach flavoured gummy shark that you might get at a dairy, um, and I really like that one, but, I, uh, think my favourite above that might be one that tastes like chocolate milkshakes. Um, and then, also, having one that's minty is really nice, 'cause it's quite refreshing. Libby: I just like the fact that it tastes like candy basically\u2026 That's what was appealing to me (laughs). Clouds Iain: just think it's a very basic and satisfying thing to do just to push out a huge big cloud of something and I really like trying to do you know, smoke rings and that kind of thing with it... and it's just a bit of fun. Abe: It ... it just seemed like a novelty of being able to, to play with the smoke [he refers to ENDS aerosol as smoke], do smoke tricks, that sort of stuff. Which is, once again ... another big side of the culture that a lot of people are into. Abe: There's nothing I think is pref-preferable about smoking. Um, with vaping I guess, being able to make some sort of fun out of it, with the games, and the tricks, would be one of the only benefits I could think of, over not doing it. Iain: I just really like blowing big clouds of vapour....I just think it looks fun...it's different from cigarettes in the sense that you do it to fit in and look like other people, you know what I mean, I just think it's a fun hobby to sit there going (exhales), blowing huge big clouds of vapour, just it's fun... Simon: I think it's [clouds] pretty interesting. It's like some people are going forward with like not just using it for personal, like medicinal use, like more using it for recreational, which is kind of nice. Yeah. William: there are always videos going around. More like viral videos that ... people were doing all these tricks. I always thought they were incredibly impressive being able to do stuff like that and it sort of got me hooked into it. Um, so yeah. Int: So when you said there were always videos going around ... what's this on, like, Facebook? Or ... William: On Facebook and stuff. Just on my newsfeed. All these social media sites. There were just all these ... check out these vapers who can do all these sort of tricks and sort of ... (Chuckle) I was really interested by it, so I sort of wanted to learn how to do that. DevicesJoseph: I like to be able to, to be able to change it to what I want. Um, I actually haven't changed it in a long time but that's 'cause I'm really happy with it\u2026 But I wouldn't be able to go in and buy a tank and have it run like I've got this running. So, um, the customised, the customisability is quite, quite nice.Jane: I'll lie in bed before I go to sleep at night or something, and I'll have a vape .... and it's just sort of like this instant kind of head rush, and then like my whole body just kind of feels very relaxed, and I feel kind of sleepy\u2026.And, yeah, just very calm and ...",
