In such conditions, the education system should maintain stability, be sufficiently flexible in terms of teaching methods and technologies, as well as the management of processes. In the authors' opinion, the most effective tool to manage reactively the learning process as a complex system is a feedback. In order that teachers have a real opportunity to control the quality of this process, it is necessary to identify objective criteria for the assessment of quality in the context of the differentiation of motivational attributes. In addition, this way provides for teaching staff a possibility to evaluate the effectiveness of a particular method to influence on the motivational criteria. As a case study, different student's groups were selected to compare their involvement in the process with traditional and online forms of learning, their performance and the impact of the learning form on the projects quality prepared by students.",

In addition, university must ensure the graduation of specialists who are ready to respond to the time challenges and work in critical conditions. Thereby, the following questions were formulated: (1) What changes in the management system of university, department and educational process should be implemented in order to increase efficiency during critical situations? (2) What changes in educational content are needed to ensure the necessary quality of education as well as involvement and motivation of students? (3) How will it be possible to use the experience gained after the crisis time? Since the educational system is very inert due to the length of the learning process, effective feedback could be an approach to overcome this inertia. The way to implement a feedback between teachers and students will be a key factor to determine the quality of educational process and student involvement. Such a system will be more objective and will help to identify certain problems for an individual student or a group of students as well as within the framework of a training course or any section of a subject.",

Analyzing the innovative features and advantages of remote work of the summer school, the authors of the article [1] note that despite the positive reviews, the results are still far from expected. On the one hand, the participants spoke in favor of working out a real problem in the quality of their projects. The authors recommended choosing a real problem for each year and dividing it into small problems (mini-projects) among all remote groups. On the other hand, it is necessary to modernize the communication system for clear and fast communication. It is expected that due to the development of 5G wireless communication technology, the data transmission speed will be improved, the latency will be reduced, and the reliability will be increased [2] . 5G will expand the future use of virtual and augmented reality in learning and big data collection, empowering future learners to have more realistic experiences, thereby making digital deep learning more effective [3] .",

Using such forms of interaction with the audience as chats, forums, posting videos on YouTube with the ability to ask a question in comments and other means of interactivity provided by distance learning, can increase students' desire to learn. Besides, networked learning settings are more convenient than individual ones [9] . Much research has focused on science, technology, engineering and mathematics in relation to traditional media, and research examining the impact of digital learning games has only recently become more prevalent. The research [10] explores how different depictions of scientists in an evolutionary learning game can influence motivation. Motivation was higher when the students played with a male mentor of high masculine character and a women of low-feminine character. In [11] , it is emphasized that the teacher plays a critical role in managing the sense of \"balance\" for \"confidence in achievability\" and \"urgency\". As the authors of [12] point out, the more a teacher knows about his students, the better he can instruct them. This is more relevant to engineering education as it is a professional course that is also skill-oriented. The article discusses the \"Draw an Engineer in the Workplace\" method used by the authors to understand a student's knowledge of the engineering profession. This is very important for building a personal educational trajectory and subsequent career. The article [13] examines the motivational factors affecting the students of higher educational institutions. The most important pedagogical question, solved by the authors, concerns the expediency of structuring teaching for a deeper development of students. Another important aspect is the lecturer's potential, the ability to inspire and motivate students and influence their perception of education. In any case, e-learning in industrial engineering should harmonize aspects of immediate future employment needs, academic-based learning and results-based learning [14] . And with all the positive aspects of online learning, it is necessary to be ready for the resistance of students, explained by the discomfort during the transition from traditional lectures to active learning [15] .",

This contradiction is most acutely reflected in engineering education, since it is the engineer who generates new ideas, which are subsequently implemented in the form of new products and technologies. That is, the educational system should develop the student's abilities for technical creativity and technologies implementation skills in various industries. Thus, the engineering education goal is to prepare an engineer \"for the future\". This goal can only be realized if the student has developed the ability to be creative. An important role is played by the motivation system. In order to influence certain student's personality qualities, as well as reasonably form pedagogical goals, it is necessary to have a system of priorities, as well as the most effective methods of influencing both each student and the group as a whole in terms of result achieving. A flexible universal mechanism is needed that allows: tracking changes in the external environment; adequately respond to them, adapting individual elements of the educational system to new conditions; introduce new technological advances into the educational process.",

The learning form in such a system largely determines the relationship between teacher and students. At the same time, the combination of learning organizational forms in a real and virtual university campus and a combination of traditional teaching methods with e-learning technologies create a fundamental difference between blended learning and the traditional system. At the same time, the combination of technologies can occur both at the level of an individual course, discipline, and at the level of the educational program as a whole [16] . Based on the personal qualities data of students, an individual approach is implemented in the system: the teacher can choose such teaching methods that will be effective specifically for this student. An important role in this case is played by the effectiveness of the educational process quality assessment and monitoring system. In the context of differentiating motivational features, objective criteria for assessing quality should be identified. Only in this case the teacher will have a real opportunity to assess the effectiveness of this or that way of influencing the motivational criterion. In addition, the quality assessment system, developed on the basis of the formalized criteria use, will be more objective and will allow identifying certain problems both for an individual student or a students' group and within the training course framework or any discipline section.",

To assess the effectiveness, a system of indicators has been developed, while adjusting the process in order to increase its efficiency can be performed on each learning phase and on each management contour.

In fact, this mechanism is one of the options for implementing situational management. The second circuit identifies the motivations problems for specific students group; and in the third loop, methods are formed and resource management is implemented. According to the ISO series, the first and second circuits focus on result quality and the second on process quality. The first and second circuits are more dynamic, since operational management is realized with the help of specific decisions made. The third circuit implements strategic management, so it is more difficult to adjust. The modular open multi-user architecture of the developed blended learning management system serves as the basis for the reliability and stability of its operation, since it allows you to quickly identify and eliminate the causes of emerging failures, eliminate their impact on other modules, and increase the speed and quality of technical support for users. This approach allows you to implement all the necessary functionality, supplementing it as necessary. Fig. 1. a) three-circuit management scheme, b) control system schematic diagram.",

In the second group of questions, the student's attitude was assessed in accordance with the formulated criteria. The third group of questions provided an opportunity to formulate your own answer. The results of processing the questionnaires are shown in the diagrams (Fig. 6) . On the whole, students were satisfied with the organization of the educational process. In emergencies cases, as recent events related to COVID-19 have shown, globalization and the world openness (if problems arise in a single country) can lead to an imbalance of economic systems in interconnected industries and countries. In such conditions, the education system must maintain stability, make it possible to overcome inertia, set the development vector and be flexible enough in terms of teaching methods and technologies, as well as process management. In this regard, the most effective tool for reactive management of the learning process as a complex system is feedback, which, thanks to modern technologies, can give a positive result quickly and efficiently. In order for teachers to have a real opportunity to control the quality of this process, it is necessary to define objective criteria for assessing quality in the context of differentiating motivational characteristics. In addition, this method gives the teaching staff the opportunity to assess the effectiveness of a particular method of influencing the motivation criteria. For students, this will provide an opportunity to receive a quality education.",
