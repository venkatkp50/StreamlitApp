He presented a numbness in his left arm and legs with headaches 24 hours after the vaccine injection. In the second day, he had asymmetry of the face which was aggravated by the installation of disturbance of consciousness and a state of agitation. His vital signs were normal. A brain CT scan without injection was done showing a right deep parietal ischemic stroke. The treatment was initiated by aspirin. cerebral MRI showed a very extensive stroke ischemic in the superficial and deep right parietal territory with the onset of hemorrhagic rearrangement of the right basal ganglia, magnetic resonance imaging angiography of the supra-aortic trunks was normal.
