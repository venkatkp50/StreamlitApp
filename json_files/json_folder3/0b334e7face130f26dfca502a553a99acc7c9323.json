We also use Hs and Fs to rank the COVID-19 lethality in these countries based on the complexity hierarchy. Our results suggest that the most proactive countries implemented measures such as facemasks, social distancing, quarantine, massive population testing, and hygienic (sanitary) orientations to limit the impacts of COVID-19, which implied lower entropy (higher predictability) to the COVID-19 lethality. In contrast, the most reactive countries implementing these measures depicted higher entropy (lower predictability) to the COVID-19 lethality. Given this, our findings shed light that these preventive measures are efficient to combat the COVID-19 lethality.",

It is essential to understand COVID-19 lethality dynamics to design more robust strategies to the pandemic. Several methods has already been used to study COVID-19. We can highlight the application of mathematical modelling [10, 11] , statistical approaches [12] , physics analysis [13, 14] , machine learning methods [15, 16] and many others [17, 18] .
