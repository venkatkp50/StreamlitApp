            "text": "Objective: To evaluate patient acceptability and bowel preparation efficacy of sodium picosulfate-magnesium citrate (PICOPREP) for colonoscopy. Methods: A questionnaire survey regarding the patient acceptability of bowel preparation agent PICOPREP was administered to 54 patients, and its efficacy was evaluated using the Ottawa Bowel Preparation Scale (OBPS). Results: Eighteen (33.3%) participants reported that PICOPREP is very easy to drink, 30 (55.5%) easy, four (7.4%) acceptable, one (1.9%) difficult, and one (1.9%) very difficult. The flavor was very good as reported by eight (14.8%) participants, good by 25 (46.3%), neutral by 20 (37.0%), bad by one (1.9%), and very bad by none. The number of patients who requested PICOPREP was 42 (77.7%), indicating its high acceptability. Evaluation of the OBPS score showed that the rectosigmoid colon had significantly better polyethylene glycol (PEG) scores than PICOPREP, but the entire colon did not show a significant difference between PICOPREP and PEG scores (1.09 \u00b1 0.65 vs. 1.17 \u00b1 0.76, p = 0.632 in the right colon; 0.48 \u00b1 0.52 vs. 0.72 \u00b1 0.66, p = 0.079 in the mid colon, 0.93 \u00b1 0.49 vs. 0.63 \u00b1 0.52, p = 0.012 in the rectosigmoid colon, and 3.28 \u00b1 1.70 vs. 3.20 \u00b1 1.90, p = 0.836 in the entire colon). Conclusion: PICOPREP is considered as one of the important options due to its good patient acceptability and high efficacy similar to PEG.",

Its flavor is orange. 7 The efficacy rate calculated based on the general colon cleansing, the primary efficacy endpoint in the Japanese phase III study (J-CLEAR study), was 97.7% in the PICOPREP divided-dose group (once the day before and once on the day), 92.0% in the day before the group (twice the day before), and 95.3% in the control group (isotonic PEG; Niflec; EA Pharma Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). 8 These results revealed the non-inferiority of the PICOPREP group to the control group. According to the results of the patient questionnaire, all factors, that is, the ease of drinking, overall impression, taste, and amount acceptability, were significantly better in the PICOPREP group than in the control group. The incidence of adverse events was 12.7% in the PICOPREP divided-dose group, 15.2% in the PICOPREP the day before the group, and 15.4% in the control group, indicating that all groups had similar results. PICOPREP considers patient acceptability by allowing them to choose a small volume of the agent (150 ml \u00d7 2 times) and a transparent drink to be taken after taking the agent according to their tastes. In addition, it is a bowel preparation that can be taken at home as per the patient's preference. These facts supported that PICOPREP considering patient acceptability will become more important as an option for bowel preparation in the future. The divided-dose regimen of PICOPREP has been shown to be effective, safe, and acceptable. 9,10 Therefore, the method is adopted at our hospital.",

All consecutive patients who experienced taking the preparation with PEG solution containing ascorbic acid (Moviprep; EA Pharma Ltd, each liter contained 100.0 g of macrogol 4000, 7.5 g of sodium sulfate, 2.7 g of sodium chloride, 1.0 g of potassium chloride, 4.7 g of ascorbic acid, 5.9 g of sodium ascorbate, and lemon flavoring) were scheduled for a colonoscopy for screening, diagnostic evaluation, or surveillance of ulcerative colitis (UC) by two gastroenterologists who specialize mainly in inflammatory bowel disease (Masaaki Shimada and Hiroaki Iwase), and they completed a questionnaire on the patient's acceptability of PICOPREP which was handed out by a nurse after colonoscopy. The questionnaire's contents included sex, age, ease of drinking, taste, volume, choice of place to take pretreatment drug (at a hospital or home), and preparation agent for the next procedure compared with previous PEG experience ( Figure 1 ). In addition, alcohol consumption (daily alcohol consumption exceeding 20 g in women or 30 g in men), smoking status (current smoker, former smoker, and never smoker), history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or abdominal surgery, and the presence or absence of constipation (two or fewer defecations per week) were obtained from medical records. The sample size was determined based on the number of patients in our hospital during the study period. The questionnaire was administered to 67 outpatients, and 13 patients were excluded because they did not fill out the questionnaire or did not provide an appropriate answer. Thus, a total of 54 patients were analyzed.",

This method benefits both patients and medical staff. From the patient's point of view, in addition to being able to take bowel preparation agents at home at the patient's own pace, they can use the restroom individually without consideration of others, which can help reduce mental burden. Furthermore, since the preparation has been completed at home, a colonoscopy can be performed immediately after visiting the hospital. From the perspective of hospital facilities, if the number of colonoscopies performed is high, the number of restrooms may be insufficient. However, if the preparation agent is taken at home, the number of restrooms will be less of a problem. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19; a new type of coronavirus infection), which occurred in early December 2019 and is prevalent in 2020, is isolated from airway secretions and feces. 12 Therefore, the use of the same restroom by multiple people in a hospital during colonoscopy preparation is feared to might increase the risk of COVID-19 infection. In that respect, bowel preparation using PICOPREP is considered to be beneficial for patients and medical staff because it completes preparation at home, leading to a significant reduction in COVID-19 infection risk.",

However, special consideration should be made for patients with renal failure and congestive heart failure, and elderly people. 17 According to the consensus statement and guidelines compiled by the American and European academic societies, the effectiveness of PICOPREP is evaluated to be almost the same as that of conventional PEG. 18, 19 Moreover, in a multicenter observational study conducted in France on the best colonoscopy preparation agent for inflammatory bowel disease, both agents PICOPREP and PEG-2L were equally safe and were reported to have significantly better efficacy and patient acceptability than PEG-4L. 20 In this study, UC was observed in 33 patients (61.1%), a well-known cause of unknown chronic diseases. Therefore, a stable remission period should be considered for long-term treatment. In addition, colonoscopy is performed regularly because of the risk of colorectal cancer in UC. [21] [22] [23] Therefore, a bowel preparation agent with high patient acceptability should be selected in order to evaluate the mucosal condition or follow-up UC. 24, 25 In this respect, PICOPREP is highly acceptable for UC, and its bowel preparation level is comparable to that of conventional PEG preparations. In this study, the quality of bowel preparation in the UC group was significantly superior in the rectosigmoid colon compared to the non-UC group.
