Moreover, the number of homeless persons [8, 9] and the proportion of migrants among them [10, 11] is increasing in France as in other European countries, with the forecasted economic recession following the pandemic likely to only accentuate this further [12] .",

Variables relevant for inclusion in the multivariate statistical model were determined via univariate Chi-square (X\u00b2) analysis, as supported by Hosmer and Lemeshow [33, 34] . A 75% confidence limit was used, based on Bursac et al. [35] , to prevent the arbitrary exclusion of important variables [36, 37] . Additionally, centre type was included as a random effect in all models. Highly collinear variables were removed based on associations at 99% significance, and subsequently checked using Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) with a limit of VIF < 3.",

Moreover, persons who were French, or originated from Africa or Eastern Mediterranean regions, had higher levels of depression than persons originating from a European country other than France. Depression was associated with multiple worries and reluctance towards future lockdowns. These findings highlight the frequency of mental health difficulties and the importance of mental health care amongst persons experiencing severe socioeconomic disadvantage, which should be accounted for in strategies aiming to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in vulnerable groups. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies on the prevalence of mental health difficulties among homeless persons in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Thus, it may be that participants were already depressed prior to the pandemic. Further analyses using longitudinal samples are necessary to understand the chronology of mental health difficulties within this population, as well as the impact of homelessness on individuals' symptoms. Secondly, our study population is unrepresentative of France's total homeless population, consisting exclusively of those in temporary accommodation. Persons residing in alternative living situations, such as camps, squats, or the street, were not accounted for. Our findings may therefore disproportionally represent the prevalence of depression within this vulnerable population. Recruitment also consisted primarily of persons residing within two large cities (Paris and Lyon) and surrounding suburbs. Previous research has found increased loneliness during lockdown amongst adults living in urban areas compared to rural environments [39] . For this reason, the inclusion of other regions of France would have proven interesting, particularly non-urban areas.",

A key benefit to conducting interviews in person is the associated increase in participant response rate [42] and the possibility to include participants with low literacy who could not complete self-reported questionnaires. Given the sensitive nature of some of the study questions, this study's low rate of missing data (1.3%) amongst variables used is commendable. Those with lower levels of education have been found to show higher rates of item non-response to health surveys, alongside males being less likely to respond to questions on depression [43] ; two factors in which this population saw a majority. The use of interpreters for those unable to respond in French or English is also likely to have greatly increased the inclusivity of our dataset. Finally, the ECHO questionnaire design benefitted from collaboration with the organisations managing the homeless shelters which were included in our study.",

However, research on the rate of depression amongst homeless populations shows figures both higher [49, 50] and lower [2, 40] than in our study. These disparities may result from differences in methodology. For example, a Parisian study on homeless mental health, of which 52% were migrants, observed a depression prevalence of 57% [51] . However, recruitment took place in a free healthcare clinic, and as prior illness is a known risk factor for depression [52, 53] this elevated prevalence of depression is not surprising. In comparison, our study consisted of persons receiving accommodation after periods of exceptional adversity, considering that 65% of our sample were staying in a camp, squat, or on the street prior to lockdown. This may be reflected in the lower rate of depression. Moreover, our data collection occurred mostly in Paris and surrounding regions (74% of participants), where homelessness often results from a lack of affordable housing and is less reflective of severe poverty [10] . Unfortunately, such differences make it hard to determine what influence the pandemic had on our findings.",

One could argue that the rate of depression in this population might demonstrate a brief, transient stage during this period of instability. However, even after treatment, the risk of relapse for depression is high, with research suggesting a 10-80% rate of recurrent episodes (dependent on depression severity) [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] . Therefore, identifying risk factors for depression within this population may not only alleviate suffering during times as turbulent as the pandemic or bouts of homelessness, but further improve the chance of mental stability and good health in later life.",

This was surprising, as previous research amongst homeless populations has found depression to be more prevalent amongst migrants than local residents [51] . Moreover, despite the \"healthy migrant effect\", a recurrent finding that migrants often have better health than native residents [60] , recent data also suggest that migrants may actually be more vulnerable to mental health problems that non-migrants [61] . However, the causes for homelessness are also likely to vary between migrants and local residents. Our findings may then be explained by mental health difficulties increasing the likelihood of being homeless more so within native populations. Whether these rates are accentuated by the COVID-19 pandemic, or our sample consisting of solely those experiencing homelessness, is not possible to establish from our data. However, seeing as the pandemic increased the rate of financial insecurity and unemployment [62] , and therefore housing instability [63] , these factors are likely to confound each other.",

Even more paradoxically, previous research has found that depression increased with age during the pandemic in association with higher levels of chronic illness in older subjects [52] . Age is a known predictor of chronic illness [69] , and within our cohort chronic illness was seen to increase the risk of depression significantly. One potential explanation for our findings may be that older participants felt less impacted by the pandemic. Younger subjects may be more concerned about their career, social life and future in general. Worries surrounding the future were significantly more common among depressed (75.7%) compared to non-depressed (61.2%) participants. Further research is needed to see how the differential effects of the pandemic on age groups change with time. This is of particular relevance to migrants, as European Union statistics have found migrants to be, on average, much younger than a countries native population [70] . This was echoed by our sample, in which the average age of French nationals was 12 years older than non-French subjects.",

This association between loneliness and depression is of particular relevance to the pandemic, with lockdown measures not only increasing loneliness [71] , but more severely so in those with low socioeconomic status [39, 72] . Within our population, increased loneliness since the start of lockdown was seen amongst 37% of subjects. This is considerably higher than figures from COVID-19 research on the US adult population, which saw loneliness increase from 11% in 2018 to 13.8% in April 2020 [73] .

Much of the temporary accommodation this study recruited from, created in response to the pandemic, was, or will soon be, subsequently disbanded [82, 83] . The effects this may have on mental health warrant investigation. Moreover, due to data collection occurring in the very first stages of the pandemic, it is possible certain social and financial effects had not yet occurred. This may explain the lack of significant association seen between fiscal worries and depression. Further investigation within this population is needed to explore the relationship between mental health and financial disruption during later stages of the pandemic. We are currently (Spring 2021) conducting a second wave of the ECHO study in a similar population augmented with persons living on the street, to gain better understanding of long-term patterns of health within this population in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Increased loneliness was also seen in 37% of subjects since the start of lockdown, alongside higher levels of worry surrounding isolation amongst depressed participants. These findings can teach us about not only health inequalities in the context of COVID-19, but also how similar circumstances may affect the mental health of future populations with comparable disadvantage. Closer attention must be paid to those most at risk, as supporting good mental health within these communities will in turn increase the likelihood of their progression to stable housing and better living conditions in general.
