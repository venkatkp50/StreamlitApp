Due to the unique circumstances the 2022 Games face-the Omicron spread, high virus transmissibility in winters, and uncertainties about vaccine efficacy and future variants of concern, safety measures amid the Beijing 2022 Games will be one of the most intricate among large international events held during the pandemic. To ensure athletes' health, safety, and ability to participate in the Games, the organizers have introduced the Olympic COVID-free \"bubble\" protection ecosystem, in which COVID-free athletes could stay and be protected from potential infections that could upend their Games plans, if not their career as well. However, while staying in the \"bubble\" is key for athletes' health and success, there is a lack of insights on factors that might prevent athletes from continuing their scheduled Olympic journey as scheduled. To shed light on the issue, based on Beijing 2022 Olympic Playbooks and most up-to-date guidance issued, this article and its accompanying infographic were developed to illustrate factors that could influence athletes' ability to join and stay in the \"bubble\", participate in the Games, and further build their career. Furthermore, we also adapted and integrated easy-to-adopt mental health de-stress techniques recommended by the World Health Organization to help athletes better thrive amid the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, in or outside of the \"bubble\".

In light of the high prevalence of breakthrough cases amid Omicron spread (COVID-19 infections in vaccinated people), 2 it is important to give equal weight to all safety measures that could protect athletes' safety during the Games. Furthermore, the intensity, and possible negativity, 4 of media reports on the Games, may further add stressors that could strain athletes' mental health. 5 However, there is a dearth of research on how athletes should cope with the range of mental health concerns and challenges they face during the Games.

Thus, to shed light on the issue, based on Beijing 2022 Olympic Games Playbooks and most up-to-date guidance issued, 1,3 we developed an infographic to illustrate factors that could influence athletes' ability to join or stay in the COVID-free \"bubble\". Furthermore, in light of the mental health consequences the pandemic has already induced and the additional burden athletes might face amid the Games, 7 mental health de-stress techniques, 8 which are developed by the World Health Organization and easy-to-adopt, are also adapted and integrated into the infographic to help athletes better thrive amid the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, in or outside of the \"bubble\".
