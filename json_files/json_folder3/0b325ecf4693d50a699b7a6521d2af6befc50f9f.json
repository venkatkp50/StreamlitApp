            "text": "With the first 2020 surge of the COVID-19 pandemic, many health care workers (HCW) were redeployed to critical care environments to support intensive care teams to look after high numbers of patients with severe COVID-19. There was considerable anxiety of increased risk of COVID19 for staff working in these environments. Using a multiplex platform to assess serum IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 N, S and RBD proteins, and detailed symptom reporting, we screened over 500 HCW (25% of the total workforce) in a quaternary level hospital to explore the relationship between workplace and evidence of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Whilst 45% of the cohort reported symptoms that they consider may have represented COVID-19, overall seroprevalence was 14% with anosmia and fever being the most discriminating symptoms for seropositive status. There was a significant difference in seropositive status between staff working in clinical and non-clinical roles (9% patient facing critical care, 15% patient facing non-critical care, 22% nonpatient facing). In the seropositive cohort, symptom severity increased with age for men and not for women. In contrast, there was no relationship between symptom severity and age or sex in the seronegative cohort reporting possible COVID-19 symptoms. Of the 12 staff screened PCR positive (10 symptomatic), 3 showed no evidence of seroconversion in convalescence. Conclusion: The current approach to Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) appears highly effective in protecting staff from patient acquired infection in the critical care environment including protecting staff managing interhospital transfers of COVID-19 patients. The relationship between seroconversion and disease severity in different demographics warrants further investigation. Longitudinally paired virological and serological surveillance, with symptom reporting are urgently required to better understand the role of antibody in the outcome of HCW exposure during subsequent waves of COVID-19 in health care environments.",

We stratified our results according to staff demographic and workplace. RPH is a UK hospital specialising in cardiothoracic medicine and critical care which has been involved in supporting the regional COVID-19 critical care response including retrievals of ventilated patients from across the region and establishing ECMO at retrieval hospitals prior to transfer. We used an in house developed Luminex multiplex serology assay to detect serum IgG to nucleocapsid (N), spike (S) and the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) SARS-CoV2 antigens to determine evidence of previous virus exposure. This paper highlights: (1) the detailed methodology for the multiplex COVID-19 serological testing; (2) the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 N, S and RBD antibodies in staff in clinical and non-clinical roles; (3) the distribution of symptoms within seropositive and seronegative cases, and (4) the risk factors for more severe COVID19 based on intersecting categories of age group, ethnicity and sex.",

Several seropositive staff members had very low S and RBD binding but high N binding (Figure 1a and b). In contrast very few samples showed low N binding but high S or RBD binding. In fact, no sample in our training set had high RBD without similarly high N binding ( Figure S1b ).

It is unclear if differences in seroprevalence between staff groups represents risk of workplace infection. However at the time of the study, most non-clinical facing staff worked in open plan offices where the wearing of face masks was not policy at that stage and social distancing was inconsistently adhered to. In contrast, staff in critical care adhered to guidance strictly. These results may provide some re-assurance to critical care staff and staff running hospital transfers including ECMO implementation, that the current PPE guidelines are fit for purpose. A potential confounder to this interpretation is that the participants in the study were self-selected and as such this may introduce bias however these results complement those of other published studies, that staff working in the critical care environment are at lower risk of workplace acquired infection compared with other health care environments (27) . Whether all hospital workers at increased risk of COVID19 is unclear noting that demographic matching is required to answer this question.

With considerable overlap between symptom reporting in early COVID-19 and that of other common respiratory viruses, identifying symptoms that are more specific to SARS-CoV-2 infection is important, not least as screening resources even in the most wealthy countries are limited with the aim of targeting screening at the individuals presenting with symptoms most likely representing COVID19 infection. Analysis of free field symptom reporting, and correcting for multiple tests, we found that anosmia was the most discriminating symptom for seropositive status in our cohort. This is consistent with recently published reports of COVID-19 confirmed patients reporting anosmia additional to fever and continuous cough as being one of the most discriminating symptoms of COVID-19 (29) (30, 31) . Recent onset anosmia has now been added to the 3 symptoms used to diagnose COVID-19 and prioritise track a trace screening in the UK (32). As we move into winter when prevalence of infection with other respiratory viruses will soar, ongoing evaluation of the reliability of using these three symptoms (anosmia, persistent cough and fever) to direct COVID-19 testing will be important noting that in our cohort, 25% of seropositive staff reported no history of symptoms that they considered consistent with possible COVID-19. These results complement existing data generated through both seroprevalence and virus surveillance in health care workers and the population, demonstrating that 15-40% of individuals have asymptomatic infection in the UK with highest prevalence in younger cohort (27, 31) (33) More detailed interpretation of these data is limited by the low numbers of staff with contemporaneous PCR swab results. Of the 12 staff who reported previous SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive by nasal swabbing (10 symptomatic, 2 though surveillance), 3 were seronegative (all female and 2 moderately symptomatic at time of swabbing). Serum samples for all staff were taken at least 4 weeks after symptom reporting so this does not reflect premature serum sampling rather it suggests seroprevalence may under-represent infection rates. Diagnostic thresholds were established using acute phase sera from patients with moderate to severe disease and as such may have reduced sensitivity for detecting history of exposure particularly in those with asymptomatic or mild infection in whom short lived or no seroconversion has been reported (34) . In addition, some exposed individuals have been reported to have evidence of cell mediated immune responses in the absence of serum antibodies (12) . How prevalent this is not yet known.",

There was no relationship between age and symptom severity in female seropositive staff or seronegative staff. Being of male sex and aged >40 years are reported a risk factors for severe COVID19 (12) . Older males are at increased risk of pneumonic complications from other viruses such as influenza (35) and other causes of community acquired pneumonia (36) however on multivariate analysis the male sex as an independent predictor of disease severity is often not sustained. Detailed analysis of the relationship between age and sex in seasonal and pandemic influenza shows that sex hormones and virus specific pathogenesis of disease influence the relationship between age, sex and disease severity in man and murine models of disease (37) . Understanding the differences between the sexes in pathogenesis (and possibly immunopathogenesis, including antibody mediated exacerbation of disease) of COVID-19 will be important to inform targeted disease prevention and treatment strategies.",

Anosmia most reliably predicts seropositive infection in this cohort. 3. Serum antibody status likely significantly under-represents infection prevalence. 4. Further investigation is needed to understand the relationship between serum antibody response and disease severity by demographics noting the role of different antibodies in developing COVID-19 disease remains unclear. .
