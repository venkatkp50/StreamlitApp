Additionally, the authors presented the challenges and constraints that companies face when trying to implement these systems. The communication aspect of digital twin with a number of other applications was shown as a major factor in achieving a complete virtual representation of an asset, process or product. Another element identified as a part of the analysis conducted in this cluster was also the analysis of the symmetry between real and virtual space that enables the analysis of systems under real world conditions. All this could be possible if multiphysics models, sensors and bidirectional data connections between the digital and the physical twin are used [15, 17, [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] . Figure 5 exemplifies the importance and influence of Tao F. on the subject, which coincides with the previous analysis. ",

Lindkvist L., Liu C. and Xu X. were authors with more than six publications who were not present in the first search. Regarding citations, Tao F. was also in Table 6 shows the affiliations of the authors. Only a few of the 205 institutions stood out with more than four publications on the subject. The institution with the most numerous scientific production was Chalmers University of Technology with eight publications, followed by Beihang University and Polytechnic University of Milan, each with five publications. The institutions with the highest number of publications in digital twin and smart manufacturing, and Industry 4.0, are presented in Table 2 . There were 174 institutions with just one material. Similar to the general search and analysis, the next step, as presented in Table 7 , refers to the publishers. Again, Elsevier was the publisher with the highest number of publications (40) , followed by IEEE with 27 publications. The difference between this and the earlier analysis is that MDPI is now in fourth place, and Taylor & Francis is in fifth, while previously for the general analysis it was the other way around. Although Springer Nature was in third place, MDPI had a higher impact index and, respectively, H-index. Table 7 presents the publishers that published the most articles, with the number of citations and the impact index. Scientific documents were also classified for the specific analysis ( Figure 6 ). Proceedings papers and articles represented 89.25% of the scientific papers published by researchers. Figure 7 presents the classification based on the number of publications. Scientific documents were also classified for the specific analysis ( Figure 6 ). Proceedings papers and articles represented 89.25% of the scientific papers published by researchers. Figure 7 presents the classification based on the number of publications. Table 8 presents the countries with the highest number of publications (\u22654 papers) in relation to the number of publications. The countries with the highest number of authors that published at least one material in digital twin and smart manufacturing and Industry 4.0 were from Italy (18) and China (18) , followed by an identical number of documents from authors in Germany, Sweden and USA (12, respectively). Table 8 presents the countries with the highest number of publications (\u22654 papers) in relation to the number of publications. The countries with the highest number of authors that published at least one material in digital twin and smart manufacturing and Industry 4.0 were from Italy (18) and China (18) , followed by an identical number of documents from authors in Germany, Sweden and USA (12, respectively). The network of citations based on the authors (as a unit of analysis) was also analyzed for the specific analysis. VOSviewer was used to visualize the networks. As shown in Figure 8 , there were 60 clusters and 71 links, and the total link strength was 90. Again, only authors with a minimum of two documents were analyzed, and from the total number of authors only 72 met this threshold. From this analysis, the largest set of connected items is presented in Figure 9 . The network of citations based on the authors (as a unit of analysis) was also analyzed for the specific analysis. VOSviewer was used to visualize the networks. As shown in Figure 8 , there were 60 clusters and 71 links, and the total link strength was 90. Again, only authors with a minimum of two documents were analyzed, and from the total number of authors only 72 met this threshold. From this analysis, the largest set of connected items is presented in Figure 9 . As observed from this cluster, the most influential connection was between the authors Kristina Warmefijord and Rikard Soderberg. Additionally, their knowledge extends to Zheng Pai and Chen Chun-Hsien. The research in the field also presents a collaboration between Kristina Warmefijord and Rikard Soderberg, in which they study digital twindriven production mainly regarding assembly lines [61] , try to find an effective method for spot welding sequence optimization [62] , or try to identify industrial challenges in areas such as management, system-level, education, working process and simulation [63] . The findings in the cluster are in accordance with the analysis in Table 5 where Sodenberg R., Warmefjord K. and Lindkvist L. were the authors that had the highest number of publications in digital twin, smart manufacturing and Industry 4.0.",

Applications of the lifecycle of industrial products can be performed As observed from this cluster, the most influential connection was between the authors Kristina Warmefijord and Rikard Soderberg. Additionally, their knowledge extends to Zheng Pai and Chen Chun-Hsien. The research in the field also presents a collaboration between Kristina Warmefijord and Rikard Soderberg, in which they study digital twindriven production mainly regarding assembly lines [61] , try to find an effective method for spot welding sequence optimization [62] , or try to identify industrial challenges in areas such as management, system-level, education, working process and simulation [63] .

This analysis was strongly connected with China, which had the greatest number of publications on this topic.

Therefore, whether we are talking about digital twin from the point of view of real vs. virtual systems, manufacturing processes or automation in manufacturing, it can be seen that Tao F. was one of the main contributors. This is also in agreement with [68, 69] which mentioned some important contributions of Tao F. such as Digital twin-driven product design, manufacturing and service with big data, Digital Twin Shop-Floor: A New Shop-Floor Paradigm Towards Smart Manufacturing, Digital Twin and Big Data Towards Smart Manufacturing and Industry 4.0: 360 Degree Comparison, etc., [15, 17, 70] .",

Since these types cover most of the field, other types of document categories do not have sufficient representation to warrant mentioning their important role for the subject in the scientific literature. This parameter was important in the analysis because for long time the \"proceeding paper\" had a different understanding, and was assigned within the WoS database to journal articles that initially were conference papers. They were later assigned two labels, articles and proceedings papers, since analysis revealed differences between the number of pages and citations, thus giving us the chance to also differentiate them in this paper. It was seen that these types are the preferred manner in which scientists/researchers choose to present their findings to the scientific world [72] .",

After conducting the analysis using VOSviewer, it was observed that the network revolved around Tao F. for the general search, with other authors just starting to collaborate with the created clusters. This demonstrated that Tao F. is currently the author with the highest influence on this subject. Additionally, the specific search revealed that Sodenberg R. is the author with the strongest connection of the three keywords used in this paper. The analysis of citation nodes was performed because the frequency of citations constitutes an academic value and impact mark. Thus, in our networks, we could see the most influential authors and their importance in the field based on the number of citations and links created.",
