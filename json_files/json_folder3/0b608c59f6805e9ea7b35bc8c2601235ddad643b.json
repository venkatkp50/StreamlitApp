We evaluated the impact of N501Y on neutralizing activity of COVID-19 convalescent sera and on anti-RBD IgG assays. Methods: The susceptibility to neutralization by COVID-19 patients' convalescent sera from Hong Kong were compared between two SARS-CoV-2 isolates (B117-1/B117-2) from the a variant with N501Y and 4 non-N501Y isolates. The effect of N501Y on antibody binding was assessed. The performance of commerciallyavailable IgG assays was determined for patients infected with N501Y variants. Findings: The microneutralization antibody (MN) titers of convalescent sera from 9 recovered COVID-19 patients against B117-1 (geometric mean titer[GMT],80; 95% CI, 47\u00c0136) were similar to those against the non-N501Y viruses. However, MN titer of these serum against B117-2 (GMT, 20; 95% CI, 11\u00c036) was statistically significantly reduced when compared with non-N501Y viruses (P < 0.01; one-way ANOVA). The difference between B117-1 and B117-2 was confirmed by testing 60 additional convalescent sera. B117-1 and B117-2 differ by only 3 amino acids (nsp2-S512Y, nsp13-K460R, spike-A1056V). Enzyme immunoassay using 272 convalescent sera showed reduced binding of anti-RBD IgG to N501Y or N501Y-E484K-K417N when compared with that of wild-type RBD (mean difference: 0.1116 and 0.5613, respectively; one-way ANOVA). Of 7 anti-N-IgG positive sera from patients infected with N501Y variants (collected 9-14 days post symptom onset), 6 (85.7%) tested negative for a commercially-available anti-S1-IgG assay. Interpretation: We highlighted the importance of using a panel of viruses within the same lineage to determine the impact of virus variants on neutralization. Furthermore, clinicians should be aware of the potential reduced sensitivity of anti-RBD IgG assays.",

Early SARS-CoV-2 virus isolates in December 2019 and January 2020 were already genetically diverse. In the first two months after the discovery of SARS-CoV-2, different genetic clades have emerged, including the V, S and L clade according to the GISAID nomenclature [3] . The first major mutation was the spike D614G, which first emerged in February 2020 and then dominated the world.

In addition to cell surface ACE2, the interaction between spike protein and soluble ACE2 has been shown to facilitate endocytosis [9] . The spike protein N-terminal domain, RBD and S2 are targets of neutralizing antibodies, with the RBD being the most immunogenic part [10\u00c012] . Anti-RBD antibody has a high correlation with neutralizing antibody titers [13, 14] . COVID-19 vaccines are designed to elicit antibody against the spike protein. Hence, SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations in the RBD, especially those at positions that interacts with ACE2 [15, 16] , is of particular concern because these variants may escape natural infection or vaccine-induced humoral immunity.",

Furthermore, these variants may jeopardize vaccine efficacy [20] . These variants have also caused reinfections [21] . Although some studies have suggested that the convalescent sera neutralizing antibody titer is lower for these variants than for wild type, these studies were conducted in Europe or USA. Since there are geographical differences in the lineages in different parts of the world, results from Europe or USA patients may not represent those from others. Furthermore, the number of patients' serum specimens in these studies are relatively small. In the current study, we compared the neutralizing antibody titers against different lineages of viruses with convalescent serum from patients initially infected with different lineages. Furthermore, we assessed the difference in antibody against wild type and N501Y mutant RBD with a large serum panel consisting of > 250 patients.",

The binding of antibody in convalescent sera were statistically significantly lower for N501Y RBD than for wild type RBD.

There are conflicting results from these studies, with some showing slight reduction of antibody titers for B.1.1.7 lineage virus [31, 32] , while others showed no difference [33] . In the current study, we have shown a large difference between the two B.1.1.7 lineage viruses, although there was no difference in the RBD amino acid sequences of these two isolates. Therefore, it is important to select multiple viruses to ensure the generalizability of the results. The difference between these two strains were located at nsp2 (S512Y), nsp13 (K460R), and the spike protein (A1056V). A1056V is located in the S2 subunit, which is required for the fusion of host and viral membrane. It has been suggested S2 can be a target of the neutralizing antibody for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 [34, 35] . Indeed, neutralizing antibodies targeting the S2 region have been found [36] . D796H mutation in the S2 region has been proposed to reduce neutralization susceptibility by convalescent plasma and is found in the B.1.1.318 [37, 38] . D614G causes conformation change of the spike protein, and therefore mutations in the S2 subunit may affect neutralization by allosteric mechanism [39] . Nsp13 is a helicase and a potent interferon antagonist, while the function of nsp2 is currently unknown. It remains to be determined which of these mutations is responsible for the difference in MN titers. Fig. 4 . Correlation between the ratio of Euroimmun anti-S1 IgG assay and the log MN titer of sera from 9 convalescent COVID-19 patients against different viruses. The ratio of Euroimmun anti-S1 IgG assay is calculated by dividing extinction coefficient of patient's serum over the extinction coefficient of the calibrator. The number in the upper left hand corner of each group represents the r 2 value, and was calculated using the simple linear regression. The solid line indicates the best fit line, while the dotted lines indicate the 95% confidence band.",

One study showed that the anti-N IgG assay by Abbott had earlier seroconversion than the Euroimmun anti-S1 IgG assay, although the seropositive percentage was above 35% for samples collected 9-10 days after symptom onset and 70% for samples collected on days 13-14 [40] . Our previous study showed that anti-N and anti-RBD IgG appear near the same time [13] . Therefore, anti-RBD IgG induced by infection with N501Y variant may not bind well to wild type RBD. These results suggest that anti-RBD IgG immunoassay should be modified for a better detection of anti-RBD antibodies. Furthermore, there is a possibility that second generation vaccines containing variant spike RBD may have reduced efficacy against non-N501Y strains.",

A global effort is required to understand how these variants affect the susceptibility of convalescent serum from different countries which may have been infected with unique lineages. Third, the number of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants was small, and the anti-S1 antibody testing was performed with only a single commercial assay due to limited volume of the serum specimens. A larger cohort would be required to verify whether the variants will affect the performance of different serological assays.",
