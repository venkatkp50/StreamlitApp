            "text": "There is a debate in Argentina about the effectiveness of mandatory lockdown measures in containing COVID-19 that lasts five months making it one of the longest in the World. The population effort to comply the lockdown has been decreasing over time given the economic and social costs that it entails. We contributes by analyzing the Argentinian case through information of mobility and contagion given answers to recurrent questions on these topics. This paper aims to fill the gap in the literature by assessing the effects of lockdown measures and the regional relaxation on the numbers of rate of new infections. We also respond to issues of internal political discussion on regional contagion and the effect of marches and unexpected crowd events.We use pool, fixed and random effects panel data modeling and Granger causality tests identifying relations between mobility and contagion. Our results show that lockdown in Argentina has been effective in reducing the mobility but not in way that reduces the rate of contagion. Strict lockdown seems to be effective in short periods of time and by extend it without complementary measures loss effectiveness. Contagion rate seems to be discretely displaced in time and resurging amidst slowly increasing in mobility.",

By March, 20 th long-distance and regional bus services were suspended and inside Buenos Aires city circulation was restricted. The province of Mendoza also entered in quarantine and the Ministry of Economy created a maximum price policy for a basic basket of foods.

One positive outcome of the prolonged lockdown is perhaps the low registered death rate.

For this to be taken into account we must rely in a dynamical panel data where we must include lags values of the variables. Dependent and mobility panel data variables also are stationary according to standard tests. Dependent variable is stationary up to 4 lags and covariates are also to even higher lags so we included 7 lags for these variables in a way of encompassing a week. We assumed that provinces or regions might play an idiosyncratic role in spreading the virus dummy variables were included in the case of random effects modeling. Table 5 and Table 6 present the result for a dynamic panel data model with fixed and random effects, respectively. We present five models where from simplest to more complex modeling adds more variables for each type of effect. In the case of lags and location dummies we only publish significant results. In both fixed and random effect models residential mobility emerge as correlated with the rate of contagion as previously found with some simpler model option reveals retail also as significant. Lags of mobility are significant in diverse degrees. There is also a repeated significance of all time effects with a negative effect (weekend, festivities, and trend). The first two are related to how data was taken that made most probably to a potential infected to assist to a medical unit on weekdays than weekends to be tested. The third one remarks some diminishing but negligible effect on this period of time.

Dummies , , , , , , and \u2212 , are significant revealing idiosyncratic shocks on the rate of contagion for BAAC, Santa Fe, BAMA and BPO without BAMA, respectively. Does lockdown slow down the rate of contagion? The evidence is clear in terms of altering and reducing mobility. However the rate of contagion continues being exponential but apparently displaced in time from late March to early May, 2020. Statistically all mobility (including residential) are positively associated to the rate of contagion, once considering diverse lags. Mobility has not stop at all but reduced and that trend is steadily growing as time passes away. As for the results of another countries [7] the lapse of time from lockdown implementation to effectiveness in reducing rate of contagion is within a month. Taking that into account and reviewing Figure 1 again the first month was successful on that purpose. No other measures taking by another countries were seriously implemented in the country white it is suggested to be combine with many other measures [22] . Some of them [23] that depends upon people's preventive measures (face covering, social distance, self-quarantine) were implemented but state-related measures are still waiting serious implementation (such as expanding testing, widespread effective use of technology, protective equipment of frontline key workers, contact tracing, among others).",

Adopted measures can be divided in an initial strict implementation called mandatory isolation or lockdown and a later lesser strict variant called social distancing. One must recognizes that both measures focus on reducing the mobility and through that diminishing the spreading of the Covid-19. Panel data and Granger causality identify lagged patterns in mobility jointly with time and location effects associated to the rate of contagion. Abstracting from estimations and by observing data, lockdown seems to be effective in a short period after implantation but without scaled complementary measures this measure seems to be short-ranged.
