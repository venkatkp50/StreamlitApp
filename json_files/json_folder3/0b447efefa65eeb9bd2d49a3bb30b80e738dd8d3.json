Petoukhov, Hyperbolic rules of the cooperative organization of eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes, Bio Systems (2020), doi: https://doi.Abstract. The author's method of oligomer sums for analysis of oligomer compositions of eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes is described. The use of this method revealed the existence of general rules for the cooperative oligomeric organization of a wide list of genomes. These rules are called hyperbolic because they are associated with hyperbolic sequences including the harmonic progression 1, 1/2, 1/3, .., 1/n. These rules are demonstrated by examples of quantitative analysis of many genomes from the human genome to the genomes of archaea and bacteria. The hyperbolic (harmonic) rules, speaking about the existence of algebraic invariants in full genomic sequences, are considered as candidates for the role of universal rules for the cooperative organization of genomes. The results concerns additionally the problem of the origin of life. The described phenomenological results were obtained as consequences of the previously published author's quantum-information model of long DNA sequences. The oligomer sums method was also applied to the analysis of long genes and viruses including the COVID-19 virus; this revealed, in characteristics of many of them, the phenomenon of such rhythmically repeating deviations from model hyperbolic sequences, which are associated with DNA triplets. In addition, an application of the oligomer sums method is shown to the analysis of amino acid sequences in long proteins like the protein Titin. The topics of the algebraic harmony in living bodies and of the quantum-information approach in biology are discussed. .

Jordan noted the main difference between living and inanimate objects: inanimate objects are controlled by the average random movement of their millions of particles, whose individual influence is negligible, while in a living organism selected -genetic -molecules have a dictatorial influence on the whole living organism [McFadden and Al-Khalili, 2018] . Taking into account the dictatorial influence of DNA and RNA molecules on the whole body, the author focused his research on a special analysis of numeric parameters of nucleotide sequences in single-stranded DNA of different genomes and their parts. As a result of this research, a new method of analysis of nucleotide sequences was created, which has led to discovering new numeric rules of cooperative oligomer organization of eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes. These materials are described below. All initial data on nucleotide sequences for this analysis were taken from the GenBank.",

These sequences carry information transmitted in a noise-immune manner from generation to generation. They contain a great number of repeats and complementary palindromes. For example, in the human genome, about a third of DNA sequences are represented by complementary palindromes [Gusfield, 1997; McConkey, 1993] . In evolutionary biology, the abundance of such complementary palindromes in genomes is seen as evidence of not random DNA sequences, that is, their irreducibility to a set of random mutations (see additional data in [Fimmel, Gumbel, Karpuzoglu, Petoukhov, 2019; Petoukhov, Tolokonnikov, 2020] ).",

Many authors have devoted their works to the analysis and discussion of this rule (see, for example, [Fimmel, Gumbel, Karpuzoglu, Petoukhov, 2019; Prabhu, 1993; Rapoport, Trifonov, 2012; Rosandic, Vlahovic, Gluncic, Paar, 2016; Shporer, Chor, Rosset, and Horn, 2016; Yamagishi, 2017] ). According to [Albrecht-Buehler, 2006 ], this rule applies to the eukaryotic chromosomes, the bacterial chromosomes, the double-stranded DNA viral genomes, and the archaeal chromosomes provided they are long enough. In connection with the hidden rules of long DNA sequences, Chargraff introduced the important term \"a grammar of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f biology\" [Chargaff, 1971] , which is repeatedly used by his followers (see, for example, [Yamagishi, 2017] ).",

Right: deviations of the real OS-sequence \u03a3 A,n,1 from the model hyperbolic progression S A /n in percentages. This result is striking because it shows that knowing only the number of nucleotides A, that is, only one member of the number series shown in Fig. 2 .1, at left, one can predict with the high accuracy all other 19 members, each of which is a sum of 4 n-1 possible kinds of n-plets. The number of possible kinds of n-plets in these sums is growing rapidly, becoming astronomically huge: 4, 16, 64, 256, 1024, ..., 4 10 , ..., 4 19 . Of course, in the human chromosome \u21161, for example, not all possible 4 19 kinds of the mentioned 20-plets exist but the total amount of all those kinds of 20-plets, which exist in this chromosome, is practically equal to S A /20 with a high level of accuracy shown below.",

For this reason, the revealed hyperbolic sequences in genomes can be also called genomic harmonic progressions, and, in this mathematical sense, one can talk about the harmonic rules and the harmonious organization of genomes described below. The historically famous name \"the harmonic progression\" comes from the connection (2.4) with the series of harmonics in music. The sums of the first members of the harmonic progression (2.4) are called harmonic numbers. The cross-ratio (or the double ratio), which is the basic invariant of projective geometry, is equal to 4/3 for any four adjacent terms of the harmonic progression (the harmonic progression is projectively equivalent to arithmetic progressions, in which the cross-ratio of any four adjacent terms is also equal to 4/3). This connection of the harmonic progression with the basic invariant of the projective geometry is interesting with respect to a wide theme of inherited non-Euclidean symmetries in biological objects [Petoukhov, 1989] . The rich centuries-old history of the study of harmonic progressions and harmonic series is associated with the names of Pythagoras, Orem (d'Oresme), Leibniz, Newton, Euler, Fourier, Dirichlet, Riemann, and other researchers. The generalization of the harmonic series is known as the Riemann zeta function. Using musical terminology, where the term \"timbre\" refers to the totality of the set of sound frequencies in a prolonged sound, one can conditionally say that the oligomer sums method represents the analyzed nucleotide sequence as some \"oligomer timbre\". The series of harmonic numbers serves as the discrete analog of the continuous function of natural logarithm ln(n) [Graham, Knuth, Parashnik, 1994, p. 276] ; this, in particular, connects the harmonic progression (2.4) with Weber-Fechner logarithmic law, which is the main psychophysical law and dictates informatic peculiarities for all inherited sensory channels -vision, hearing, smell, etc, whose organs (eyes, ears, nose, etc.) very differ each other in appearanc\u0435. This mathematical connection is that the natural logarithm is defined as the area under the hyperbola on the Cartesian plane [Conway, Guy, 1995, p. 250] . It testifies that genetic and different psychophysical levels of inherited biological informatics are structurally interrelated on the algebra-harmonical basis [Petoukhov, 2016 [Petoukhov, , 2020b .",

In accordance with this triangle, the Parthenon [Kappraff, 2006] and other great architectural objects were created because architecture was interpreted as the non-movement music, and the music was interpreted as the dynamic architecture (see more details in [Kappraff, 2000 [Kappraff, , 2002 Petoukhov, 2008; Petoukhov, He, 2010 , Section 2, Chapter 4]). Since the harmonic mean is related to the harmonic progression, the author indicates magnitudes of the harmonic mean in some figures of the article for the comparison analysis of OSsequences in different nucleotide sequences (Fig. 2 .5 and many others).",

The comparison analysis of the OS-representations of different genes is a new research field.

Similar results were obtained by the author in study of epi-chains in the singlestranded DNA of other analyzed genomes (see some corresponding data in [Petoukhov, 2019a] ). These results allow formulating the fourth hyperbolic (or harmonic) rule of eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes, which is considered by the author as a candidate for the role of a universal genetic rule (it is necessary to further investigate the widest variety of genomes to verify a degree of its universality).",

In such tables, all letters, doublets, and triplets automatically occupy their strictly individual places (Fig. 10.1) . Fig. 10 .1. One can note here that the classes of G 1 -, T 1 -, C 1 -, and A 1 -oligomers, analyzed in the previous Section as related to the hyperbolic rules, are connected by a special manner with the tensor family of the matrices [G, T; C, A] (n) where the symbol (n) refers to an appropriate tensor power. More precisely, in Fig. 10 .1, each of (2*2)-quadrants of the matrix [G, T; C, A] (2) contains a complete set of 4 doublets, which start with one of nucleotides G, T, C, and A; each of (2 2 *2 2 )-quadrants of the matrix [G, T; C, A] (3) contains a complete set of 16 triplets, which start with one of the nucleotides G, T, C, and A. In general, each of (2 n-1 *2 n-1 )-quadrants of the matrix [G, T; C, A] (n) contains a complete set of 4 n-1 n-plets, which start with one of the nucleotides G, T, C, and A.",

The (8*8)-matrix of 64 triplets (Fig. 10.1 ) was built formally without any mention of amino acids and stop-codons. Nothing data preliminary exist on a possible correspondence between triplets and amino acids. How can these 20 amino acids and stop-codons be located in this matrix of 64 triplets? There are a huge number of possible options for the location and repetition of separate amino acids and stopcodons in 64 cells of this matrix. More precisely, the number of these options is much more than 10 100 (for comparison, the entire time of the Universe existence is estimated in modern physics at 10 17 seconds). But Nature uses -from this huge number of options -only a very specific repetition and arrangement of separate amino acids and stop-codons, the analysis of which is important for revealing the structural organization of the information foundations of living matter. Fig. 10 .2 shows the real repetition and location of amino acids and stopcodons in the case of the Vertebrate Mitochondrial Code, which is the most symmetrical among known dialects on the genetic code. This genetic code is called the most ancient and \"ideal\" in genetics [Frank-Kamenetskii, 1988 ] (other dialects of the genetic code have small differences from this one, which is considered in the theory of symmetries as the basis from the structural point of view). \u2022 Each of sixteen (2*2)-sub-quadrants, forming this genetic matrix and denoted by bold frames, is bisymmetrical: each of its both diagonals contains an identical kind of amino acids or stop-codon.",

Taking into account that two nucleotides are purines (A and G) and the other two are pyrimidines (C and T), one can replace in these matrices the nucleotides A and G with the traditional symbol of purines R, and the nucleotides C and T with the traditional symbol of pyrimidines Y.

Secondly, coordinates of hyperbolic numbers in (10.2) have some relation to analysis of genomes by the oligomer sums method and by its modifications. For example, in 2-dimensional hyperbolic number R+j 1 Y, the coordinate R is equal to total number of purines A and G, and the coordinate Y is equal to total number of pyrimidines C and T in the considered DNA sequence. The coordinate RY in the expression (10.2) is equal to the total amounts of doublets, which start with purines A and G and end with pyrimidines C and T, and so on. The presented algebraic features of the geneti\u0441 coding system supplement the following statement in a number of author's publications [Petoukhov, 2008 [Petoukhov, , 2016 [Petoukhov, , 2018a Petoukhov, He, 2010, etc.] . The genetic code is not just a mapping of one set of elements to other sets of elements by type, for example, of a phone book in which phone numbers encode names of people. But the genetic code is inherently an algebraic code, akin to a certain degree to those algebraic codes that are used in modern communication theory for noise-immune transmission of information. Algebraic features of the genetic code are related to the noise-immune properties of this code and the whole genetic system.",

On the way to the Earth, these signals travel millions of kilometers of interference and arrive at the Earth in a very weakened and distorted form. But, magically, based on these mutilated signals on Earth, a high-quality photograph of the surface of Mars is recreated. The secret of this magic lies in the fact that from Mars not the information signals about this photo are sent, but algebraically encoded versions of these signals that are quite other. At receivers on Earth, these algebraically encoded signals are algebraically decoded into signals, which recreate the original photographic image of the surface of Mars. It should be emphasized that algebraic coding of information in the theory of noise-immune communication actively uses the mathematical apparatus of matrices, which is also used in quantum informatics and quantum mechanics as matrix operators. The author's works are aimed at studying algebraic properties of the genetic coding system for revealing hidden information rules algebraically encoded in the molecular genetic system.

Given the expressions (11.2) and (11.3), the hyperbolic rules of the OS-sequences and these rules for the approximate equality of the collective probabilities of n-plets are equivalent. Both of them reflect in different languages the oligomeric cooperative organization of genomes. This is useful to note because the author has published an effective mathematical model for the rules of collective probability, which is obviously applicable also to the above formulated hyperbolic rule \u2116 1 [Petoukhov, 2018b; Petoukhov, Petukhova, Svirin, 2019] . One should emphasize the following important aspect of the OSrepresentations of genomic sequences. Each nucleotide of a DNA sequence is a participant of those sets of its different n-plets (doublets, triplets, etc.), whose total amounts are members of OS-sequences of this DNA; in other words, each DNA nucleotide makes its small contribution immediately to many members of the OSsequences. Figuratively speaking, each DNA nucleotide is \"smeared\" (or distributed) over many members of the DNA OS-sequence (this \"smearing\" over many members of the OS-sequence is also true for each DNA doublet, triplet, etc.). Correspondingly, OS-sequences reflect a sort of an interrelation over all n-plets in DNA sequences. Or, in other words, th\u0435 oligomer sums method represents any long nucleotide sequence as a multi-partite (or many-body) system having a cooperative state regarding many its interrelated oligomers of different lengths n = 1, 2, 3,... This has some analogies with the well-known problem of multi-partite entanglement in quantum informatics described, for example, in [Walter, Gross, Eisert, 2017; Horodecki, Horodecki, et al., 2009; G\u00fchne, T\u00f3th, 2009; Amico, Fazio, et al., 2008] .",

This can be termed as \"the genomic entanglement\" or as \"the genomic tetra-entanglement\" since genomic sequences contain 4 kinds of nucleotides A, T, C, and G. It should be emphasized that the author doesn't declare an existence of ordinary physical quantum entanglement in the genomes, but only that the mathematical apparatus of the theory of quantum informatics is suitable for a modelling the considered genetic sequences. Any long DNA sequence of nucleotides can be analyzed as a multicomponent quantum system, whose quantum state is determined by the tensor product of the quantum states of its subsystems, represented by sets of oligomers of different fixed length n where n = 1, 2, 3,... Let us turn to the above-mentioned author's model of properties of genomic sequences expressed by the expressions (11.2) and (11.3) [Petoukhov, 2018b; Petoukhov, Petukhova, Svirin, 2019] . This model is based on the tensor products and some other formalisms of quantum informatics and concerns, first of all, the hyperbolic rule \u21161 of the oligomer cooperative organization of genomes. The model introduced the notion \"genetic qubits\" based on different pairs of binary-oppositional molecular traits of adenine A, guanine G, cytosine C, and thymine T. Appropriate 2n-qubit systems in separable pure states were constructed, where nucleotides A, T, C, and G (and also DNA doublets and other n-plets) were represented by appropriate computational basis states in Hilbert spaces of corresponding dimensionalities. For example, cytosine C was represented as the computational basis state |00> of the 2-qubit system in the 4-dimensional Hilbert space, thymine T -as the computational basis state |01>, guanine G -as the computational basis state |10>, and adenine A -as the computational basis state |11> of the same 2-qubit system. Correspondingly, 16 doublets were represented as 16 computational basis states of the 4-qubit system in the 16-dimensional Hilbert space: for example, the doublet CC was represented as the computational basis state |0000>, the doublet CT -as |0001>, \u2026, etc. This model can be used for a deeper understanding of the genomic entanglement.",

Figs. 11.1 and 11.2 show examples of such confirmations by the comparisons of different OS-sequences calculated for the human chromosome \u21161 in three cases of locations of attributive nucleotides in its n-plets: 1) at the first position in n-plets (data on the appropriate OS-sequences are taken from Fig. 2.3) ; 2) at the second position; 3) at the third position. One can see from the shown results that the differences \u0394% of the corresponding members of these three OS-sequences from each other are less than 0.1%, that is these OS-sequences are practically identical. These differences were calculated for each n by the formulas \u0394% = 100(1 -Pos1/Pos2)% and \u0394% = 100(1 -Pos1/Pos3)% where Pos1, Pos2, and Pos3 refer to values indicated in the rows Pos. 1, Pos. 2, and Pos. 3. Here the results are presented only for n = 2, 3, 4, \u2026, 10 but similar situations of practical coincidences of the corresponding members of the considered OS-sequences are also true for larger n. Another large bunch of predictions about genomic sequences is given by the quantum-information model for quantitative interrelations of different n-plets, which start from the same doublet, or from the same triplet, etc. The model predicts, in particular, that the amount S 2 of any of 16 doublets NN is algebra-harmonically interrelated with the total amounts S 3 , S 4 , S 5 , \u2026 of oligomers in the following sets: 4 triplets, which start with this attributive doublet NN; 16 tetraplets, which start with this attributive doublet NN; 64 pentaplets, which start with this attributive doublet NN; and so on. This interrelation is again based on the harmonic progression (2.4). More precisely, according to the model prediction, the ratios of these total amounts S 2 /S 3 , S 2 /S 4 , S 2 /S 5 , \u2026 should be correspondingly equal to the ratios of the second member 1/2 of the harmonic progression (2.4) to its subsequent members 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, ... that is to values 3/2, 4/2, 5/2, \u2026. Fig. 11 .3 presents the confirmation of this model prediction by the comparison of the amount S 2 of each of 16 doublets to the total amounts S 3 , S 4 , S 5 of n-plets (n = 3, 4, 5), which start with this doublet, in the human chromosome \u21161. The right part contains appropriate values of the ratios S 2 /S 3 , S 2 /S 4 , and S 2 /S 5 , which are equal to the same magnitudes 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 for the cases of all 16 doublets.

In the considered case of Titin, the accuracy of the coincidence of the sequences of phenomenological and model values is lower than in the case of genomes described above. This seems to be due to the relatively short length of the titin amino acid sequence compared to the lengths of genomic nucleotide sequences.

At least from the time of the Pythagorean doctrine of the aesthetics of proportions, the following idea exists: \"the aesthetic principle is the same in every art; only the material differs\" [Schumann, 1969] . In light of this, architecture has long been interpreted as frozen music, and music as dynamic architecture. Additional speculation about the possible genetic basis of some aesthetic parallels in various arts arises though the very idea of the connection between the feeling of beauty and the genetic system is not new: it is reflected, for example, in the title of the article \"Beauty is in the genes of the beholder\" about a connection of some parameters of the DNA double helix with the golden section [Harel, Unger, Sussman, 1986 ].

In linguistics and other fields, Zipf's law speaks on the frequency of encounter of separate words or other separate objects. In contrast, the hyperbolic rules of the genomes focus on OS-sequences of the total amounts of n-plets and the genomic tetra-entanglement, that is, on the relative number of not separate oligomers, but the whole sums of sets of different n-plets distributed inside the genomic sequence, where each separate nucleotide is a part of many oligomers set existing simultaneously (each nucleotide is a distributed participant of many members of the appropriate genomic OS-sequence at once and makes a contribution to each of them).
