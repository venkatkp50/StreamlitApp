Overt thyroid diseases, such as hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, occur in approximately 0.5% and 0.05% of pregnant women, respectively and are associated with adverse outcomes for pregnant women and their fetuses (13, 14) . Compared with overt thyroid diseases, thyroid dysfunctions such as subclinical hyperthyroidism and isolated hypothyroxinemia and thyroid autoimmune diseases have higher incidences (14) and have been associated with an increased risk for preeclampsia, spontaneous abortion, preterm delivery, low birth weight, and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) (15) . Thus, the timely detection and treatment of pregnant women with thyroid dysfunction is clinically important (16) . Few studies have focused on the physiological and psychological well-being of pregnant women during an infectious disease outbreak to understand the development of subclinical diseases that also need clinical management. The purpose of this study was to examine whether the COVID-19 outbreak was independently associated with thyroid hormone fluctuation and an increased risk of thyroid dysfunction in early pregnancy.",

On January 20, 2020, COVID-19 was officially classified as a Type B infectious disease by the National Health Commission and thus defined as the start date of public awareness. Those pregnant women who underwent thyroid assessment between January 20, 2019, and March 31, 2019, were classified as the pre-COVID-19 epidemic group (Group 1), and those pregnant women screened between January 20, 2020, and March 31, 2020, were classified as the during-COVID-19 epidemic group (Group 2). A total of 3038 women in Group 1 and 2082 women in Group 2 were enrolled, all of whom had thyrotropin (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), free triiodothyronine (FT3), TPOAb or TgAb concentrations available and had no COVID-19 symptoms such as fever, cough, and myalgia symptoms (1) . Women were excluded if they were not in their first trimester, underwent in vitro fertilization, had twin pregnancies, or had a history of thyroid disease or TPOAb positivity. Ethics approval was obtained by the institutional review board (No. GKLW2019-51).",

The propensity score is the conditional probability of having a specific exposure level (Group 1 and Group 2) under a given set of baseline covariates (19, 20) . A multivariate logistic regression model was used to estimate propensity scores, and all baseline characteristics listed in Table 1 were included as covariates, using a 1:1 matching protocol with no replacement for matching with a caliper width equal to 0.01 and evaluating the P values of all baseline covariates before and after matching to assess whether they are balanced. Standard differences of less than 5% indicate a relatively small imbalance. All variables in the matched cohort are without missing data. Descriptive analysis of normally distributed continuous variables is expressed as the mean and standard deviation (SD). For nonnormally distributed variables, we use the median and interquartile range (IQR); categorical variables are expressed in proportion and percentage. We used the Mann-Whitney U test to compare the median difference of continuous variables and the chisquare test to compare the difference in proportion. To perform a univariate analysis of the association between thyroid dysfunction and all other factors, a chi-square test was used (if the number in the cell was less than 5, Fisher's two-sided exact test was used). In a multivariate logistic regression model, logistic regression analysis was performed on the relationship between (subclinical) thyroid diseases and all those variables with a P value <0.1 in univariate analysis. Sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis were used to evaluate the difference in thyroid hormones and (subclinical) thyroid diseases in each subgroup between the matched Group 1 and Group 2 to identify potential bias. A two-sided P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical tests were conducted using SPSS version 24.0 and R version 3.6 (Packages forestplot, ggplot2).",

Infectious disease pandemics will naturally increase anxiety and fear among individuals in society (4) . Pregnant women are vulnerable due to additional safety concerns for their fetuses because they also worry that vertical transmission will damage the health of the fetus in addition to their own health (9) . A substantial portion of pregnant women overestimated their risk of COVID-19 infection during the outbreak, leading to even higher rates of depression and anxiety than what is typically expected during the antenatal period (9) . The depression rate in pregnant women is positively correlated with the number of newly confirmed cases, the number of suspicious cases and the number of deaths per day (21) . It is well documented that antenatal depression and anxiety are associated with poor pregnancy outcomes and have negative influences on child development (22) (23) (24) .",

The concentration of FT4 increases in the early stages of pregnancy and maintains this level until delivery and then rapidly declines postnatally (17) . Conversely, FT3 changes little during pregnancy (17) . In early pregnancy, the increase in FT4 levels is due to increased placental production of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which leads to a reduction in TSH (11) . Although the fetal thyroid begins to develop around the 5th or 6th week of pregnancy, the fetus cannot synthesize thyroid hormone by itself during early pregnancy (25) . Thus, the fetal thyroid hormones required for normal neurological development are completely maternally derived. Alterations in maternal FT4 concentration due to significant stress, such as a COVID-19 outbreak, may increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.",

Previous studies have shown a relationship between thyroid antibody positivity and concomitant anxiety or depression disorder, where individuals with autoimmune thyroiditis exhibit an increased chance of developing depression and anxiety (29) . However, the relationship between thyroid autoantibodies and preterm delivery is controversial. A prospective cohort study of 120 pregnant women in western European cities reported that those with normal thyroid function but positive TPOAb or TgAb had a significantly increased preterm birth rate (16% vs. 8%, p <0.005) (30) . Conversely, another prospective study of 1179 women in Japan did not find an increased risk of preterm birth among TgAb-positive women. The preterm birth rates in the study group and the control group were both extremely low (3% vs. 3.1%), which the researchers suggested was the result of ethnic differences (31) . Another prospective study of 10062 pregnant women reported that the risk of preterm birth did not increase among women who were positive for TPOAb and/or TgAb in early pregnancy, although premature rupture of membranes significantly increased (32) . Importantly, thyroid autoantibodies are associated with the suboptimal development of offspring. One study evaluated the neurocognitive ability of 43 5.5year-old children who were born at term. Children with TgAbpositive mothers had lower sensory performance and exercise scores, and those with TgAb-positive umbilical cord blood also had lower sensory performance scores (33) . Although we do not know the pregnancy outcomes of women exposed to the COVID-19 outbreak who had isolated hypothyroxinemia or TgAb positivity in our study until writing this article, we will follow up on their pregnancy outcomes and the health status of their offspring.",

Several crosssectional studies have shown that those with thyroid dysfunction have an increased risk of anxiety or depression (36) (37) (38) . Therefore, previous studies have mostly focused on the relationship between depression or anxiety and TSH concentration, overt hyperthyroidism or overt hypothyroidism. The relationship between mental disorders and isolated hypothyroxinemia, FT3 or FT4 has not been explored. In this study, a higher concentration of FT3, a lower concentration of FT4, a higher risk of isolated hypothyroxinemia and a nonsignificantly higher concentration of TSH were found in pregnant women exposed to the COVID-19 outbreak. We speculate that this is because anxiety due to the COVID-19 outbreak amplifies the TSH enhancement of FT4 to FT3 conversion (39) . This hypothesis requires further study.",

            "text": "In the current study, we found some interesting results in the sensitivity analysis. BMI was a determinant of thyroid function during pregnancy. Consistent with previous research (40, 41) , we found that higher maternal BMI preconceptually was associated with higher FT3 concentrations, lower FT4 concentrations, and an increased risk for isolated hypothyroxinemia and TgAb positivity. The correlation between BMI and thyroid function has been reported previously and is hypothesized to be due to changes in energy balance caused by increased heat production in obese women (42) . Why were the higher concentration of FT3, lower concentration of FT4 and higher risk of isolated hypothyroxinemia in women > age 40 exposed to COVID -19 outbreak not significantly different? First, the sample of pregnant women older than 40 years is relatively small. Furthermore, advanced maternal age was associated with lower FT3 (43) . The enhancement of TSH on the conversion of T3 to T4 reaches its peak at the age of 30 to 40 years (44) . Its enhancement begins to weaken after 40 (44) . This can also explain why the risk of FT4 and isolated hypothyroxinemia is more significant in women aged 30 to 39 years in this study than in women < age 30. We also found that the higher maternal and paternal education level, the less significant the difference between the COVID-19 exposure and the nonexposure group, that is, the lower FT3 concentration, the higher FT4 concentration, and the lower risk of isolated hypothyroxinemia. A study that evaluated the depression and anxiety symptoms of pregnant women under COVID-19 may explain it. It showed that the higher the maternal education level, the less likely it is to report anxiety and depression because a higher education level often means higher income, more comprehensive knowledge of COVID-19, access to good medical resources and better prevention measures (21) . Therefore, the thyroid function of pregnant women with higher education levels is less affected. The effect of paternal age on maternal FT3 and FT4 concentrations and the risk of isolated hypothyroxinemia is similar to that of maternal education level and age. This may be because people tend to choose those who are close to their age as their spouse. This can be proven in this study. The correlation coefficient between paternal age and maternal age was 0.72 (P<0.001). We also found that the main conclusions in TgAb-positive or TgAbnegative women are similar to the whole population. However, for TgAb-positive women, there was no significant difference in the increased risk of isolated hypothyroxinemia due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The small sample size of TgAb-positive women could partly explain this finding.",

It has been fully demonstrated that participants in this article are also more likely to experience symptoms of anxiety and depression under the pressure of the epidemic (21) . Further, this study was completed within 2 months of the COVID-19 outbreak, and thus, only short-term thyroid responses were examined; longterm follow-up is required to examine subacute thyroid dysfunction, pregnancy outcomes, and postpregnancy thyroid function. Thyroid hormone changes were observed in pregnant women, and whether there is the same change in nonpregnant women and the general population is worthy of further research. In addition, although we have taken the confounding factors that affect thyroid hormone levels into account as comprehensively as possible, there are possibly some other unmeasured confounders causing bias in the propensity-score-matched cohort.",

We found that exposure to the COVID-19 outbreak was independently associated with a higher FT3 concentration, a lower FT4 concentration, a higher risk of isolated hypothyroxinemia and a lower risk of TgAb positivity in pregnant women during the first trimester in Shanghai. Based on our study, we can infer that anxiety induced by COVID-19 during early pregnancy significantly influenced maternal thyroid function. Timely thyroid function tests and psychological intervention programs are recommended to be considered for pregnant women during emergencies or extremely stressful events and warrant additional research. Furthermore, the association between pregnancy outcomes and COVID-19 outbreaks requires further exploration.",
