Indeed, kidney transplant recipients (KTR) are poorly protected by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines 2 , thus prevention SOTRs from COVID 19 infection remain a difficult challenge. Owning to ineligibility in clinical trials 3 , the efficacy and safety of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines are currently limited in this fragile population, further decrease adherence to vaccination schemes 4 , 5 . Given the accumulated data available for safety and immunogenicity of mRNA vaccine 6 , 7 , there is an urgent need to develop recommendations and guidelines for better delivery of COVID-19 vaccines in SOTRs.",

Results of this study demonstrate that a significantly lower seroconversion rate and anti-S IgG titres were achieved among SOTRs after 2 doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine compared with healthy controls. Therefore, the clinical effectiveness might remain sub-optimal compared to healthy population. The seroconversion after 2 doses was 40.1%, much lower than the rates reported in other vulnerable population, such as patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (73.2%) 8 , cancer patients (51%) 9 , and patients with end-stage kidney disease (86%) 10 . Thus, SOTRs should receive the complete vaccination regimen without delay. A higher serologic response to a 3-dose (55.2%) and 4-dose (81.7%) vaccine strategy suggests SOTRs should be considered to receive booster dose regimens. Since antimetabolite and Belatacept therapy was associated with impaired immune response, alternative vaccine platforms (ie. inactive SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, recombinant adenovirus vaccine), temporary adjustment of immunosuppressive regimens may be required. The effect of augmented vaccination schedules, monoclonal antibodies and new oral antiviral agents should be assessed for SOTRs of future study.",
