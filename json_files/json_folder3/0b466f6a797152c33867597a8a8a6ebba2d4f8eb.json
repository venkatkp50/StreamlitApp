The pandemic is likely to trigger permanent long-term impacts on the transport sector in the post-COVID world. While a post-COVID \"new normal\" will be likely to incur negative consequences, it may provide an opportunity to move toward a more sustainable transport sector. This paper is aimed at developing an urban economic model with an energy focus to depict the dynamics of travel demand, energy consumption, and emissions in the post-COVID world. A set of scenarios was created according to model assumptions regarding lifestyle changes and policy interventions accompanied by the expected post-COVID new normal, to explore long-term pathways toward a deep decarbonization of the transport sector. Scenario simulations demonstrated that working from home, online shopping, and a bike-friendly infrastructure will contribute to a reduction in energy consumption and CO 2 emissions, whereas a significant shift from bus to car transport and the decreasing use of car-sharing services will adversely affect CO 2 emission reductions. The arrival of the post-COVID world may contribute to an 11% reduction in CO 2 emissions by 2060, while the maximum reduction potential could be as high as 44%. Supporting policies and strategies for encouraging remote work and online shopping as well as for promoting safe public transport, active transport, and carpooling services are needed to strongly decarbonize the transport sector in the post-COVID world. Moreover, population distribution and urban structure may also be influenced by the arrival of the post-COVID new normal, which warrant further attention for urban planning. urban economic model J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Highlights \uf06c The framework of an urban economic model that accommodates detailed transport and energy technology representations is presented. \uf06c Several scenarios up to the year 2060 are analyzed to depict decarbonization pathways for the transport sector in the post-COVID world. \uf06c The arrival of the post-COVID new normal may contribute to reducing CO 2 emissions by a maximum of 44% by 2060. \uf06c The impacts of the oncoming new normal on urban structure deserve more attention.

Because the transport sector represents a significant portion of global emissions, accounting for approximately a quarter of global energy-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, developing strategies to work toward the deep decarbonization of the transport sector will be crucial for meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement (Creutzig et al., 2015; IEA, 2009 IEA, , 2015 . However, rapid urbanization, economic development, and growing private vehicle ownership are driving dramatic increases in passenger and freight transport activities, which will outweigh all mitigation measures and counteract the global efforts to decarbonize the transport sector (McCollum et al., 2018) . Moreover, the transport sector remains a major consumer of fossil fuels, although a clean energy transition, particularly via improvements of vehicle battery technology, seemingly permits an optimistic view for low-carbon transport. Due to the continued growth in transport demand, the rapid increase in private car use in emerging economies, and the persistent reliance on fossil fuels, the reduction of global GHG emissions from transport has proven more challenging than climate change mitigation efforts in other sectors (Chung and Zhou, 2013; Pietzcker et al., 2014) .",

The emergence of COVID-19 has become the largest crisis and challenge throughout the world since World War II (1939) (1940) (1941) (1942) (1943) (1944) (1945) , and there is little doubt that COVID-19 has been altering the way of life for people across the globe, with many countries instituting travel bans and ordering residents to \"stay at home\" or \"shelter in place\". Social distancing and quarantine have become part of everyday life for the public, and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f governments advocate that people switch to \"new lifestyles\", such as remote working and telecommuting, to adapt to the extended fight against COVID-19 (Chinazzi et al., 2020; Hsiang et al., 2020; Kraemer et al., 2020) . Given these drastic changes, human society will be likely to have substantially adjusted to a post-COVID world and its \"new normal\", even if the virus disappears in the future (Carroll and Conboy, 2020) . The transport sector has been deeply affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, as the entire planet is connected by convenient transport systems and networks. Adjustment to the post-COVID new normal may create both unprecedented opportunities and challenges for the decarbonization of the transport sector. For example, remote working is widely expected to become a more permanent feature compared to pre-COVID times, and increasing time spent working from home will contribute to a reduction in fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions. However, it is also expected that a significant shift from public transit to private cars will take place, which may adversely affect CO 2 emission reductions. Because the post-COVID world is an inevitability, the key scientific question of our research asks: which opportunities could the post-COVID new normal offer for transport decarbonization and the transition to sustainability?",

The urban economic model was extended to incorporate detailed energy technology representations, to capture transport dynamics with an energy focus and to project energy consumption and CO 2 emissions. The model handles the cross-sectoral tradeoffs and interactions between location choice and transport through a series of market equilibrium conditions under which the behaviors of households and firms are defined explicitly by utility or profit maximization. Subsequently, the distribution of populations, land use, transport demand, and energy consumption that attain demand-supply equilibria are determined endogenously.",

As a prefecture-level city in southern Jiangsu Province, Changzhou is located in the highly developed Yangtze Delta region of China, extending from Shanghai to the northwest, and is considered one of the core cities in the Suzhou-Wuxi-Changzhou metropolitan circle. The prefecture-level city of Changzhou administers seven county-level divisions and, here, our study is focused on four urban districts: Tianning, Zhonglou, Xinbei, and Wujin.

We collected zone-specific data such as travel data, land-use data, and socioeconomic data, from personal trip surveys, a land-use database, and statistical yearbooks. The parameter estimation and calibration for the urban economic model were conducted in a previous study (Zhang et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017) .

In the business-as-usual (BaU) scenario, it is assumed that no lifestyle changes or policy interventions take place.

The online-shopping (OS) scenario assumes that half of in-store shopping shifts to online shopping by 2060. In the bike-friendly design (BD) scenario, the implementation of well-designed bicycle infrastructure and bicycle-sharing systems in the city encourages more people to cycle. Here, the velocity of cycling is assumed to improve by 25% by 2060. In the bus service-reduction (BR) scenario, bus services are reduced due to lockdown and social distancing. It is assumed that households need to spend more time traveling when doing so by bus.

This would be especially true when the attraction of the latter is reduced by working from home and online shopping. In the CS scenario, the declining load factor of cars increased the travel cost of car usage, which decreased the modal share of cars but increased travel by bus, biking, and walking. The modal shift from car to other modes would reduce travel costs, and more households would re-locate to suburban and peripheral areas. In contrast, households that choose to travel by bus for commuting and shopping can no longer rely on bus service under the BR scenario. The shift from bus to car travel increased generalized travel costs, which resulted in more households locating to central areas to reduce expenses for commuting and shopping trips. The overall population redistribution and shifts under the five scenarios imply that changes in lifestyle and mobility patterns are capable of reorganizing urban structure. ",

The low-carbon scenario demonstrates that the maximum emission reduction potential can increase to 44% in 2060, in the case that bus and car-sharing services would not be reduced due to the pandemic. Figure 7 presents the spatial differentiation of the reduction potential of origin-destination emissions. In both of the combined scenarios, the most significant emission reduction potentials under the new normal were produced by trips originating and ending within central areas, indicating that the city center will be the major contributor to emission reduction in the post-COVID world. Here, we tested the sensitivity of the WH, OS, BD, BR, and CS scenarios by setting parameter values to \u00b110% of the base case in each scenario to assess the impacts of more or less stringent policies on emission profiles and reduction potentials. Figure 9 displays the CO 2 emission projections under these scenarios. In the scenarios, \u00b110%",

The greatest impact on CO 2 emissions is attributable to BR, followed by OS. Emission reductions were most sensitive to a shift from bus to car transportation, indicating that modal structure in the post-COVID world will play a key role in helping to reduce emissions. Thus, the sensitivity analysis supported the robustness of the model. There are two general ways to perform policy analysis and assessment: the ex-ante approach and the ex-post approach. Ex-ante analyses simulate the future impacts of alternative policies to answer what-if-type questions (e.g., What would be the future impacts of a policy change or shock?), whereas ex-post analyses rely on historical data to quantify the effects of past policies. Econometric models, which are mostly derived using the ex-post approach, have been widely applied to identify the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the transport sector based on rigorous analyses of actual data.",

Based on a calibrated benchmark, experiments are carried out by shocking the initial equilibrium and observing the new equilibrium.

In the long-term, a bike-friendly infrastructure is also expected to positively affect the energy transition and emission reductions. The achievement of CO 2 emission reductions arises from decreases in travel demand, modal shifts from car to less energy-intensive modes such as public transport and active transport, and vehicle technology improvements toward less carbon-intensive fuels such as natural gas, electricity, hydrogen, and biomass. However, it is also expected that a significant shift from public transit to private cars and decreasing usage of car-sharing services will occur, which would adversely affect CO 2 emission reductions. Thus, the post-COVID new normal depicts an uncertain picture of transport decarbonization, ranging between worst-case and best-case scenarios. Due to the tradeoff between positive and negative effects on emission reduction, it is inappropriate to draw an overly optimistic conclusion regarding transport decarbonization in the post-COVID world. However, our simulation findings should not be interpreted to understate the role of the post-COVID new normal as a potential contributor for achieving a low-carbon transition.

The point is not to downplay the contribution of hypothetical scenarios in numerical modeling and simulations but, rather, to highlight the necessity of more realistic scenarios in the future based on government guidelines or other empirical studies. In addition, we only assumed moderate technology improvement for the technology mix but did not consider energy policies to structure energy technology scenarios and strategies required by a more sustainable and secure energy future.

Although the current energy system model can provide information on technology shares in China, it cannot capture technology details in a specific city. Thus, it is necessary to develop an urban-scale bottom-up technology model that can be integrated with an urban economic model to detect how the transport sector and energy system will affect each other. Second, while online shopping can reduce emissions via passenger transport, it may increase freight travel to deliver parcels to end-consumers. In future work, the cross-sectoral tradeoffs and interactions between the passenger and freight transport sectors must be taken into account. (1) Lifestyle changes such as working from home and online shopping would play the most important roles in contributing to emission reduction.

Although the BaU scenario did not consider any lifestyle changes, lockdown, or social distancing, CO 2 emissions still tended to decrease from 2015 to 2060, because the Chinese population is expected to decrease after the mid-21 st century, and highly efficient technologies will more rapidly diffuse into the transport sector in the future. Comparisons of the six scenarios demonstrated that CO 2 emissions can be reduced by lifestyle changes and mobility transformations. Among all scenarios, online shopping has the highest reduction potential, as 23% of CO 2 emissions were reduced by 2060, followed by working from home (14%) and a bike-friendly design (10%). However, the modal shift from bus to car travel under the BR scenario increased CO 2 emissions by 37%, by 2060, compared to the BaU level. The decreasing load factor within cars under the CS scenario also caused CO 2 emissions to increase by 16% in 2060.

As shown inFigure 5, the five original scenarios have both positive and negative effects on population concentration and urban agglomeration. For instance, the population distribution becomes dispersed as a result of working from home and online shopping, a bike-friendly design, and reductions in car-sharing services. Meanwhile, the reduction of public transport services would generate more population concentration in the CBD.

Nevertheless, although it is widely assumed that the pandemic may trigger permanent socioeconomic changes, it is imprudent to draw conclusions on transport decarbonization without elucidating the uncertainties associated with future changes in lifestyle and mobility patterns by 2060. To clarify the uncertainty associated with transport decarbonization, we further examined whether the model was robust against varying policy factors in the presence of uncertainty in the scenarios. Sensitivity analysis is commonly used to assess uncertainty, as the effects of different values in a set of parameters on a dependent variable under specific conditions are analyzed. Sensitivity analysis adds credibility to the urban CGE model by testing the model across a wide range of scenarios.",

The interplay between location choices, transport activities, and energy consumption can be described by the framework of an urban spatial CGE model. This paper facilitates a better understanding of the transport dynamics and its impacts on energy use at the city scale and allows us key insight into the deep decarbonization of the transport sector in the post-COVID world. Our model results offer policymakers a more refined overall picture of long-term implications as well as inspiration to leverage the opportunities offered by the COVID-19 crisis to move toward deep decarbonization of the transport sector.

Moreover, CGE modeling and calibration only employ 1 year of data for long-term projections and generally cannot capture the richness of time-series data used in ex-post analyses.

Even though the post-COVID new normal might facilitate the switch toward a sustainable and low-carbon transport sector, more ambitious technology advances in road transport, such as a more ambitious incorporation of electric vehicles and fuel-cell vehicles, are still required to meet the goal of carbon neutrality. Increasing populations in suburban and peripheral rural areas will be driven by the oncoming new normal, and such population redistribution may be accelerated when pursuing an objective of maximum emission reduction. The core-periphery relocation would facilitate urban expansion and economic development in suburban and rural areas, which may also help relieve traffic congestion and strong environmental pressure on overly high land prices and ease the imbalance between increasing land demand and general lack of available land resources in the CBD. The new normal may overcome the disadvantages of agglomeration caused by clustering of consumers, workers, companies, and services in urban centers, which may lead to diseconomies of scale.
