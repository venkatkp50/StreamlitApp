Recent research shows that community-based soccer can improve mental health and bone health and result in fewer hospital admissions in men with prostate cancer. However, little knowledge exists on what coaches experience, leading to a scarcity of knowledge on how to assist them in promoting and supporting the sustainability of programs. The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of non-professional soccer coaches in providing community-based soccer training for men with prostate cancer.",

Qualitative content analysis, as described by Graneheim and Lundman, was applied to analyze the data using NVivo 12 software. We identified the five following overall categories with 10 subcategories on what the coaches experienced: (1) enabling training of a clinical population in a community setting, (2) dedication based on commitment, (3) coaching on the players' terms, (4) navigating the illness, and (5) ensuring sustainability. Collectively, the findings suggest that, while the coaches felt adequately prepared to coach, their coaching role developed and was refined only through interaction with the players, indicating that coaching clinical populations may be easier in practice than in theory and a potentially transformative learning experience.",

Initial concerns about how to coach a clinical population disappeared once the coaches engaged with the players and developed their own team norms and illness management strategies. They also gained a broader perspective on their own lives, which they valued and would not otherwise have achieved by coaching a healthy population. Our study indicates that sustainable implementation and the program's sustainability can be promoted and supported through additional formal, easily accessible communication with trained health professionals and by networking with peer coaches.",

            "text": "Accumulating evidence shows that increased physical activity, ranging from prevention to rehabilitation and palliation, for people with chronic disease, including various types of cancer during all stages of disease, provides substantial health benefits [1] . Physical activity is associated with a decrease in mortality from all causes, including cancer-specific mortality in people with prostate [2, 3] , breast [4, 5] , and colorectal cancer [6, 7] . Moreover, exercise training has also shown a positive effect on cancer-specific fatigue [8, 9] and cancer-specific quality of life [8, 10] . However, exercise-based rehabilitation is not standard care for people with cancer, which is why most people with cancer are not offered physical activities or exercise [11, 12] . Thus, a large number of people with cancer state that they have an unmet need for exercise-based rehabilitation [13] . When offered, supervised exercise-based rehabilitation programs can provide safe learning environments [14] , yet supervised interventions are often gym-based, time-limited and rarely in line with user preferences [15] . Consequently, the potential to persist with exercise long-term following exercise-based rehabilitative interventions remains limited [16, 17] . Thus, there is a burgeoning appreciation of the need to promote and implement novel interventions that effectively and consistently increase and maintain levels of physical activity in people with cancer [15] . Notably, increased attention is given to exercise-based rehabilitative programs that are community-based in order to identify sustainable, cost-efficient ways of organizing physical activities for clinical populations that increase long-term engagement [18] [19] [20] . Sports participation in natural settings (e.g. recreational soccer) is viewed as a usable public health strategy that promote engagement in physical activity [21] [22] [23] [24] . Moreover, epidemiological studies have shown that sports participation is associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality and protects mental health compared to non-participation [21, 25] . Especially participation in club sports and teambased sports has been shown to be effective in improving mental and social health [25] . We developed the Football Club Prostate Community (FCPC) initiative involving implementation and evaluation of recreational soccer training for men with prostate cancer in local soccer clubs across Denmark [26] [27] [28] . FCPC was developed based on existing infrastructure for physical activity offering easy-access, time-unlimited, and low-cost community-based exercise training [29] . The training is supervised by nonprofessional soccer coaches with no requirements for prior clinical experience or training as healthcare professionals [30] . However, all FCPC coaches completed a full one-day course on the general principles and delivery of recreational soccer for men with prostate cancer, including information on treatment regimens, side effects, and contraindications for physical activity for this group [18] . The curriculum, which also includes principles on how to support a sense of community among the participants [30] , was implemented by the Danish Football Association. Evaluation of the effectiveness of FCPC suggested that the program is feasible and improves mental health [18] . The study showed that 59% of the men joined their local soccer club after completing the six-month trial period [18] , indicating a long-term engagement in physical activity. Continued participation beyond six months results in improved hip bone mineral density and fewer hospital admissions [31] .",

The only criterium for inclusion was current or previous experience as an FCPC coach who had completed the FCPC training course. As a result, three potential participants were excluded because they had been or were a player on a team rather than a coach. Of the remaining 21 potential participants, 13 wished to participate and eight did not respond. Data saturation defined the final sample size [33] . As information redundancy was identified already around the ninth or tenth interview, we chose not to contact the eight nonresponders again. Moreover, the coaches who did not respond to the initial invitation would not have added to the variation of the sample; in other words, they did not differ from the responders for type of club, age, or years of coaching experience.",

They felt adequately prepared by the one-day FCPC course but emphasized that they did not truly discover their coaching role or establish team norms until they met the players. This finding is in line with situated learning theory. Educational theorist and practitioner Etienne Wenger [37] , known for his theory on community of practice, conceptualizes learning as a social process in which learning does not take place by listening to a master, but among the participants as they regularly interact in the social context in which the intervention takes place [38] . As such, the FCPC soccer teams can be viewed as communities of practice that provide the opportunity for everyone involved to develop, for example, skills, management resources, and social capital. Some coaches stressed the importance of exchanging ideas with health professionals and peer coaches, indicating that the teams are not to be viewed as isolated communities but as part of a broader social system that involves several communities. Thus, the knowledge acquired during the one-day course, which the coaches believe should be mandatory if lay people are to coach clinical populations, is just one facet of being coach, as indicated by our findings, which show that learning also takes place when the coaches act and interact during practices. On the pitch and in the clubhouse, they learn to define their coaching role and acquire new skills of value in providing security and supporting exercise adherence in a clinical population. Of importance, the finding that the coaches identified social community as the most important aspect of participation in FCPC and therefore considered facilitating camaraderie a prominent task is in accordance with two previous studies investigating the experiences of FCPC players (i.e. men with prostate cancer) [39, 40] . These studies found, that the players conveyed camaraderie and team spirit as the most important benefit to their participation in FCPC, as well as to their continuous motivation to participate in FCPC [39, 40] .",

[45] , 79% of people who volunteer in Denmark are a member of the organization they volunteer for, ascribing institutional trust as an important factor when recruiting volunteers. Thus, the results of this study indicate that in several respects it can be advantageous to link exercise training of a clinical population in the community to an already-existing sports club to secure lay coaches to deliver the exercise intervention and to make the clinical group an integral part of the club. This also stresses the relevance of establishing and promoting a network for FCPC coaches that would allow them to share experience and knowledge across clubs. During the interviews the coaches made what appears to be a warranted appeal for better infrastructure, including more formal communication channels and referral pathways between the lay coaches and clinicians (i.e., trained health professionals in charge of and responsible for monitoring the disease and treatment). Improved infrastructure is pivotal not only in relation to the sustainability of the teams, but also with regard to protecting the players and maintaining their safety. According to Hardcastle et. al. [15] , medical and surgical oncologists are in an ideal position to offer guidance on health behavior change because patients trust their authority. Based on our results, we believe that more formal interaction pathways and communication channels between coaches/clubs and clinicians/hospitals would likely also take into consideration the coaches' awareness of the limitations of their knowledge and the boundaries of their responsibilities. This includes not using coaches to screen candidates for recruitment.",

According to the coaches of mixed teams, the players with prostate cancer show up to practice already wearing their sports clothes, most likely to hide that they use adult incontinence briefs.

Despite applying a convenience sample to secure enough participants, variability in the sample was obtained with the representation of coaches from FCPC teams in both large and small cities across Denmark. The coaches, who represented all ages, comprised both prior and current FCPC coaches, in addition to displaying a wide variation in how long they provided FCPC soccer training. A limitation is that we only interviewed male coaches as it cannot be ruled out that female coaches might have different views and experiences than those described in this study. However, we believe that these findings may be transferable to the delivery of community-based exercise interventions in other clinical populations by non-professionals with no prior experience or any training as a healthcare professional.",

Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic and the large geographic distance between the FCPC clubs, interviews were conducted via telephone. The researchers found that the telephone interviews, which were of sufficient length, served the objective of the study and resulted in sufficient information power. The interview data was rich in detail, furnishing detailed information from the coaches on their personal knowledge, the skills they acquired, and what they experienced in relation to delivery of the FCPC program. Interviews were conducted and transcribed in Danish before being translated into English by a native-speaking professional translator to ensure their accuracy.",

The coaches described few downsides to coaching a clinical population and felt they were balanced out by transformative experiences due to engaging with players, ultimately leading to a broader perspective on life.",
