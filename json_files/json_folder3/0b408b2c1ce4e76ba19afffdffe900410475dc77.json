            "text": "Aims. We previously showed that the glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) testing frequency links to diabetes control. Here, we examine the effect of variability in test interval, adjusted for the frequency, on change in HbA1c (\u0394HbA1c). Materials & Methods. HbA1c results were collected on 83,872 people with HbA1c results at baseline and 5 years (\u00b13 months) later and \u22656 tests during this period. We calculated the standard deviation (SD) of test interval for each individual and examined the link between deciles of SD of the test interval and \u0394HbA1c level, stratified by baseline HbA1c. Results. In general, less variability in testing frequency (more consistent monitoring) was associated with better diabetes control. This was most evident with moderately raised baseline HbA1c levels (7.0-9.0% (54-75 mmol/mol)). For example, in those with a starting HbA1c of 7.0-7.5% (54-58 mmol/ mol), the lowest SD decile was associated with little change in HbA1c over 5 years, while for those with the highest decile, HbA1c rose by 0.4-0.6% (4-6 mmol/mol; p < 0:0001). Multivariate analysis showed that the association was independent of the age/sex/hospital site. Subanalysis suggested that the effect was most pronounced in those aged <65 years with baseline HbA1c of 7.0-7.5% (54-58 mmol/mol). We observed a 6.7-fold variation in the proportion of people in the top-three SD deciles across general practices. Conclusions. These findings indicate that the consistency of testing interval, not the just number of tests/year, is important in maintaining diabetes control, especially in those with moderately raised HbA1c levels. Systems to improve regularity of HbA1c testing are therefore needed, especially given the impact of COVID-19 on diabetes monitoring.",

This was particularly true for those with a baseline HbA1c of 7.0-9.0% (54-75 mmol/ mol), a group where improved blood glucose control is linked to better long-term health outcomes [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] but for whom improvement in diabetes control is often a significant challenge. The association was particularly noticeable in those aged under 65 years. We also noted that there was a 6.7-fold variation in proportion of people with the highest variability in testing interval between 216 general practices. It is important to identify factors that are linked to the HbA1c trajectory as it is well established that higher HbA1c in people with both T1DM and T2DM relates to less favourable long-term health outcomes [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . While we and others have shown that HbA1c testing intervals outside guidance are associated with poorer diabetes control and reduced probability of achieving the target glycaemic status [17, 18] , this is the first time that the pattern of testing has been shown to be associated with the trajectory of HbA1c, independently of the test interval and HbA1c level. Thus, for two individuals with the same number of tests per year, our data suggests that the regularity by which those tests are scheduled also appears to be an important determinant of \u0394HbA1c over time.",

We have previously described, at a general practice level in England, that the way that HbA1c and other lab tests testing is organised (i.e., whether a test happens in a given 12-month period) as a manifest in adherence to the nationally recommended care processes [1, 2] is independently related to the proportion of people at any general practice at target glycaemic control. Furthermore, patients of working age may find attending for regular intervals more difficult, as reflected in our observation that a larger proportion of those aged <65 years was in the top-three deciles (i.e., had the most sporadic testing pattern). In terms of systemic factors, the disconnection between primary care (general practices) and secondary (acute hospital) testing may also affect the periodicity in HbA1c testing if one group is unaware of results generated by the other [27] .",

This was described by Beard et al. in 2010 [28] , who found that only 26.5% of the people with diabetes surveyed had a good understanding of HbA1c and how the level relates to health outcomes. Perception was related to demographics including a number of components of self-care and self-efficacy, as well as HbA1c. The level of understanding was predictive of the HbA1c level. This is relevant because keeping to a regular testing schedule does enhance a sense of self-efficacy [29] . Clearly, as we adjusted for the number of tests, the importance of consistency of monitoring is unlikely to be due to differences in healthcare contacts.",

Those with lower values might be argued to require more minimal intervention, whilst those with HbA1c values > 9.0% (>75 mmol/mol) are more likely to be under specialist care due to complex challenges in maintaining diabetes control. However, those in between tend to be managed within general practice and comprise a large cohort of people in whom attempting to improve diabetes control is often a challenge [30] .

Cadogan et al. [16] also demonstrated significant variation between individual general practitioners in requesting of immunoglobulins and showed that this was associated with practitioner experience and sex. However, within a practice comprising several doctors, as measured in our data, this is less likely to be a factor. Our findings also mirror what we have previously shown in terms of practice-level variation in conformity to guidance on testing frequency both in diabetes [6] and other longterm monitoring scenarios [14] . Lyon et al. showed similar variation in HbA1c testing intervals at a regional level [8] . These studies highlight the need for consistency in monitoring people with long-term conditions. While there have been individual attempts to improve HbA1c monitoring [31, 32] , including clear recommendations in international guidance [3] [4] [5] , there appears still some way to go to address this issue. Indeed, using longitudinal laboratory data, we showed that publication of guidance over 8 years made no difference to the proportion of HbA1c tests requested outside guidance [6] .

Youens et al. have recently shown that the regularity of contact with general practitioners, defined as variance in the number of days between contacts, was linked to the diabetes outcome with the most regular decile having fewer hospitalisations and lower per-patient costs than the least regular decile [34] .

Furthermore, the consistency of testing also varied between general practices. This has implications for the management of people who attend sporadically for testing and suggests the need for developing systems to improve the regularity of HbA1c testing, particularly in light of the disruption of diabetes services due to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
