The main outcomes of the study were; dysphonia and phonesthenia were reported in 79.24% and 18.86% of the patients (n = 106) with mild-and moderate confirmed COVID-19 respectively, congestion of the vocal cords was the commonest laryngoscopic finding, and there was a significant association between dysphonic subjects and rhinorrhea, taste dysfunction, sore throat, and cough. Besides, significant association was observed between phonesthenic subjects and allergic rhinitis. We have many comments regarding the methodology, results, discussion, and limitations of the study.",

Up to one month following the cure from the COVID-19 is relatively large time scale, and the prevalence of persistent symptoms might be decreased and changed from time to time [2] . Salepci et al. were reported in their study that the onset time and durations of otorhinolaryngological symptoms and general symptoms varied [2] . Therefore, this is considered as one of the main limitations of the study by Azzam et al. Although, half of the reported symptoms occurred in above 50% of the patients, the attractive thing is the highest prevalence symptom was dysphonia (n = 84, 79.24%). Furthermore, if we add the number of the patients with phonesthenia (n = 20, 18.86%) to the patients with dysphonia, therefore, nearly all patients (104/106) were complained from voice abnormalities. The authors didn't discuss this strange finding and compare with previous studies regarding the general and otorhinolaryngological symptoms. Post-COVID-19 dysphonia was reported in previous studies with much lower prevalence than Azzam et al.& s study [3] [3] .",
