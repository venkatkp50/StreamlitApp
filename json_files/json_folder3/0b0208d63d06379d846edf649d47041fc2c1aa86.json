More than 80% of the confirmed H7N9 cases reported exposure to live poultry or a live poultry market (LPM) prior to symptom onset [1] . Because the H7N9 virus has low pathogenicity in poultry, unlike highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, it is challenging to control the transmission of H7N9 from poultry to humans. LPMs were closed in the cities with H7N9 cases reported and/or environmental specimens testing positive for H7N9 during the spring 2013 and winter 2013-14 epidemics.
