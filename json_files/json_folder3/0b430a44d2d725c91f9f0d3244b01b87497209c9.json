Interruptions in chest compressions per cycle were increased with mouth-to-face-shield ventilation (mean (SD) 8.6 (1.7) s) compared with mouth-to-pocket-mask ventilation (6.9 (1.2) s, p < 0.0001).

No differences in inspiratory times were observed between mouth-to-face-shield ventilation and mouth-to-pocket-mask ventilation A total of 60 surf lifeguards were included (67% male, 33% female, mean age 25 years).

Significantly more effective ventilations (visible chest rise) were delivered using MMV (91%) when compared to MPV (79%, P < 0.001) and BMV (59%, P < 0.001). The inspiratory time was longer during MMV (0.7 +/-0.2 s) and MPV (0.7 +/-0.2s, P < 0.001 for both) compared to BMV (0.5 +/-0.2s). Tidal volumes were significantly lower using BMV (0.4 +/-0.2L) compared to MMV (0.6 +/-0.2L, P < 0.001) and MPV (0.6 +/-0.3 L, P < 0.001), whereas no differences were observed when comparing MMV and MPV.",

Application of an automated external defibrillator (AED) by bystanders shortens time to defibrillation and increases survival.
