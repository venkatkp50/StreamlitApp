            "text": "Background: Numerous traumatic experiences and post-migration living difficulties (PMLDs) increase the risk of developing symptoms of complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD) among Afghan refugees and asylum seekers, living in Austria. Research has repeatedly associated higher levels of CPTSD with higher levels of PMLDs. Summarizing PMLDs into empirically derived factors might facilitate a further understanding of their interaction with symptom presentation within distinct clusters of CPTSD. Objective: The current study aimed to investigate homogeneous subgroups of ICD-11 CPTSD and their association with demographic variables, traumatic experiences, and empirically derived factors of PMLDs. Method: Within a randomized controlled trail (RCT) CPTSD, PMLDs, and traumatic experiences were assessed in a sample of 93 treatment-seeking Afghan refugees and asylum seekers through a fully structured face-to-face and interpreter-assisted interview using the ITQ, the PMLDC, and a trauma checklist. Underlying clusters of CPTSD, superior factors of PMLDs, and their associations were investigated. Results: In total, 19.4% of the sample met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD and 49.5% for CPTSD. We identified a 2-cluster solution consisting of two distinct subgroups as best fitting: (1) a CPTSD cluster and (2) a PTSD cluster. The multitude of PMLDs was summarized into four superior factors. CPTSD cluster membership was associated with childhood potentially traumatic experience types, and one of four PMLD factors, namely 'language acquisition & barriers'. Conclusions: The results suggest that not PMLDs in general, but rather specific types of PMLDs, are associated with CPTSD. An assumed bidirectional relationship between these PMLD factors and CPTSD symptoms might lead to a downward spiral of increasing distress, and could be considered in treatment strategies.",

            "text": "Since the 1980s, ongoing and renewed conflicts, human rights violations, and unstable security conditions have forced numerous individuals to flee from Afghanistan. As the third most common country of origin, the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) recorded around 2.7 million Afghan refugees recognized under international law, and 0.3 million asylum seekers currently awaiting legal recognition, in 2019 (UNHCR, 2020) . Compared to refugee populations from other countries of origin in Austria, Afghans report particularly low health (Georges, Buber-Ennser, Rengs, Kohlenberger, & Doblhammer, 2021) . Prolonged, repeated, and/or interpersonal traumatic experiences in the country of origin or during flight are highly prevalent among refugees (Bogic, Njoku, & Priebe, 2015) , with between 40 and 90% reporting at least one traumatic experience, depending on the sample and location (Scoglio & Salhi, 2020) . Thus the diagnosis of complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD), introduced in the ICD-11, is especially suitable to capture the more far-reaching psychological consequences following complex trauma. In addition to traumatic experiences, it is important to consider post-migration living difficulties (PMLDs) in Austria in order to understand better the mental health problems in refugees. However, it is not yet clear how CPTSD and PMLDs relate to one another.",

            "text": "Traumatic exposure has been shown to severely impact mental health (Bogic et al., 2015; Cloitre et al., 2009) . In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to the influence of the multiple, heterogeneous stressors associated with facing a foreign country, language, and culture following migration on mental health (Hynie, 2018; Li, Liddell, & Nickerson, 2016) . The term post-migration living difficulties (PMLDs) subsumes various different constructs, including interpersonal stressors (e.g. discrimination, social isolation), emotional stress (e.g. feelings of loneliness), stressors associated with the asylum process (e.g. work permit, insecure visa), or migration-related aspects (e.g. family separation, language barriers) (Li et al., 2016; Schweitzer, Melville, Steel, & Lacherez, 2006) . Despite this heterogeneity, however, most previous studies used single sum scores to capture a potentially common entity , or selected specific individual PMLDs (Liddell et al., 2019) to investigate their association with mental health problems. So far, these studies have shown that while stress and feelings of anxiety may be part of a normal response associated with PMLDs, chronic exposure to PMLDs increases the risk of developing serious mental health problems at least to the same extent as traumatic experiences (Bogic et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016) . Different PMLDs might have distinct effects on mental health, and an empirical subdivision would therefore allow for a more differentiated investigation of the effects. To date, there have only been a small number of attempts to categorize the high number of PMLDs and to analyse their common effects without merely using a single sum score. Silove (1998) first subsumed the individual PMLDs into five underlying factors using exploratory factor analysis. Further efforts to categorize the total number of PMLDs resulted in partly similar domains depending on the sample, host country, and PMLDs assessed, with mostly separate groups concerning the asylum procedure, socio-economic living conditions, discrimination, and family concerns (Laban, Gernaat, Komproe, Van Der Tweel, & de Jong, 2005; von Haumeder, Ghafoori, & Retailleau, 2019) . Due to the small number of studies in this regard, and the influence of regional differences, no consensus on the subdivision of PMLDs has yet been reached. Based on the aforementioned assumption that the multitude of heterogeneous PMLDs could have different impacts on mental health, researchers have emphasized the importance of further investigating the effects of different types of PMLD on mental health (Hou et al., 2019) .",

While several studies investigated CPTSD in various samples (Knefel, Garvert, Cloitre, & Lueger-Schuster, 2015) , only a few of them took into account refugee samples (e.g. Barbieri et al., 2019) . Nonetheless, the initial evidence supports the suitability of the diagnosis of CPTSD in refugee populations and indicates cross-cultural validity . Most refugee studies identified three homogeneous subgroups including CPTSD, PTSD, and a low symptom group , or four subgroups with an additional group characterized by elevated affective dysregulation (Liddell et al., 2019) . A lower number of homogeneous subgroups of individuals with CPTSD has rarely been identified (Barbieri et al., 2019; Palic et al., 2016) . Investigations of demographic variables associated with membership of the CPTSD subgroup have yielded inconsistent findings. While some studies reported no associations with demographic variables (Barbieri et al., 2019; Hyland et al., 2018) , others found that variables such as female gender (Liddell et al., 2019) , lower educational attainment, or living alone (Perkonigg et al., 2015) were associated with membership of the CPTSD subgroup. Further results indicated associations of CPTSD with functional impairment Palic et al., 2016; Perkonigg et al., 2015) , cumulative trauma (Liddell et al., 2019) , and a higher number of comorbidities (Murphy, Elklit, Dokkedahl, & Shevlin, 2016) .

Another study also found a positive relationship of individual PMLDs, such as insecure asylum status, with CPTSD in refugees and asylum seekers (Liddell et al., 2019) . As the ICD-11 CPTSD is a rather new diagnosis, studies utilizing this classification are only just beginning to emerge, although there is more research suggesting an association between individual PMLDs and the symptoms of PTSD. For example, language learning difficulties (Kartal, Alkemade, & Kiropoulos, 2019; S\u00f6ndergaard & Theorell, 2004) , occupational problems, and difficulties in accessing social and health services (Hou et al., 2019) were found to be associated with increased PTSD symptoms. The results of a mediator analysis conducted within a meta-analysis indicated a positive association between prior traumatic experiences and PTSD, which was mediated by different forms of PMLDs such as interpersonal daily stressors (Hou et al., 2019) .",

The resulting homogeneous subgroups exhibit high external (between-group) heterogeneity and internal (within-group) homogeneity (Balijepally, Mangalaraj, & Iyengar, 2011) . Cluster analysis allows quantification of structural features of observations and is useful for simplifying data, describing taxonomies, and identifying relationships. The R package 'NbClust' was used to determine the relevant number of clusters in a dataset by evaluating 26 different indices, varying cluster size and distance measures (Charrad, Ghazzali, Boiteau, & Niknafs, 2014) . After determining the relevant number of clusters, the k-means algorithm assigns each observation to exactly one of the k clusters. The k-means method is a centroid-based clustering and divides the observations into k clusters based on an iterative clustering algorithm. It was performed with the package 'stats' in R (R Core Team, 2021). Further analysis of the cluster characteristics were used for cluster validation.",

Pillai's Trace was applied as a multivariate statistic because this estimator is more robust and less sensitive to violations of multivariate normality. As a nonparametric alternative, multiple imputation student's t t-tests were applied for post-hoc analysis. The association between CPTSD clusters and gender was investigated with \u03c7 2 tests.

A reciprocal influence between CPTSD symptoms and PMLD factors could lead to a downward spiral of elevated CPTSD symptoms, increased distress caused by PMLDs, and greater difficulties in handling the mental disorder and PMLDs. For example, difficulties in language acquisition, language barriers, and CPTSD symptoms such as associated affective dysregulation, re-experiencing symptoms and deficits in social skills might not only increase the risk of experiencing overwhelming situations but also reduce the possibilities to actively cope with those, which in turn could lead to increased emotional distress. Affective dysregulation might result in a more intense response to emotional cues and increased difficulty in calming down. In the long term, these experiences of difficulties in language acquisition and repeated confrontation with language barriers as well as associated dependency on others, might lead to increased CPTSD symptomatology, such as further deterioration of the negative self-concept, more difficulties in relationships, or social withdrawal. These dynamics and cognitive deficits associated with CPTSD (Etkin, Gyurak, & O'Hara, 2013) may further complicate language acquisition. In turn, the resulting problems in everyday life may increase the risk of social exclusion, and aggravate mental health problems (Kartal et al., 2019) . Additionally, low trust in the health care system can impede access to health care services (Ben, Cormack, Harris, & Paradies, 2017) .",

The face-to-face, interpreter-assisted, fully structured interview conducted by a trained clinical psychologist allowed for the participation of illiterate individuals and enabled the implementation of preventive interventions to reduce stress and/or concentration problems during the assessment. Moreover, the person-centred approach enabled us to examine homogeneous subgroups of CPTSD symptoms and their different associations with various PMLD factors. Nevertheless, some limitations of the study should be noted. All subjects in our sample were Afghan refugees in Austria and it cannot be excluded that different findings would have emerged in other ethnic groups or cultural contexts. Due to the cross-sectional study design, it is not possible to establish directionality. Although special attention was given to the selection of measures, and statistical methods suitable for small samples, the small sample size and the selection of a widely used but insufficiently evaluated test instrument without established subscales to assess PMLDs could still reduce the statistical power and increased the likelihood of a Type II error. It should also be noted that the study was not preregistered and Covid-19 pandemic interrupted the assessment process. As daily activities and social contacts have been limited in recent months, this might have influenced symptom severity and the experience of PMLDs. However, given the strengths of our study, the results mirrored the psychological distress in treatment-seeking traumatized refugees and asylum seekers and its association with PMLDs. Thus, future post-pandemic replications of the study with larger samples and a longitudinal design are recommended to further investigate the generalizability and the directionality of the results.",

Childhood PTE types and PMLDs in the form of difficulties in language acquisition and language barriers, should be especially considered in individuals with high CPTSD symptomatology and integrated into diagnostic and treatment strategies. A reduction of the psychological strain associated with PMLDs could be achieved by promoting, for example, affect regulation, social skills, and a positive self-concept, which are acknowledged elements of the psychological treatment of CPTSD (Sch\u00e4fer et al., 2019) . Traumafocused treatment strategies could reduce potential reexperiencing symptomatology. Individual difficulties in language acquisition and distress due to language barriers should be reduced by personalized psychological interventions to counter the particular problem, such as stress management to improve cognitive deficits associated with CPTSD. The establishment of trauma-sensitive language courses might be a further interdisciplinary task for pedagogues and psychologists (Kartal et al., 2019) .",
