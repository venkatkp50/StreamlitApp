Following the first and second doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine, we measured IFN\uf067 T cell responses, both total IgG Spike/ IgG Spike RBD and neutralising antibody responses to Spike in sera using a lentiviral pseudotyping system. Median age was 82 amongst 26 participants. Three weeks after the first dose a lower proportion of participants over 80 years old achieved adequate neutralisation titre of >1:4 for 50% neutralisation as compared to those under 80 (8/15 versus 11/11, p<0.05). Mean neutralisation titres in this age group after the first dose were lower than in younger individuals (p<0.05). Following the second dose, neutralising antibody response 50% titres were above 1:4 in all individuals and there was no longer a difference by age grouping. A significant proportion of individuals over 80 appear to require a second dose of vaccine, given in this study at three weeks, to achieve virus neutralisation.",

This is pertinent for settings where a dosing interval of twelve weeks is currently being used to maximise first dose administration. Data on vaccine responses are vital in order to understand the efficacy of vaccination using this regime, particularly in groups under-represented in clinical trials, such as those aged above 80 years who are at greatest risk of death.",

T cell responses did not correlate with serum neutralisation after the first dose. Overall, neutralisation activity increased between the first and second doses as expected ( Figure 2 ). We observed poor neutralisation activity (<50% neutralisation at serum dilution of 1:4) exclusively in participants over the age of 80 (7/15) as compared to those under 80 (0/11) after the first dose ( Figure 3 ). Geometric mean neutralisation titres in the over 80 years group after the first dose were almost an order of magnitude lower than in younger individuals ( Figure 2C , p<0.05 and Figure 3 ). Participant sera were re-tested three weeks after the second dose in all of those above 80 and in 5 of the 11 participants under 80 years old. The vaccine sera exhibited an increase in neutralizing titres against the wild-type pseudoviruses between first and second doses (Figure 2A, B) .

We have shown that a proportion of individuals above the age of 80 have a suboptimal neutralising antibody response three weeks after vaccination with BNT162b2, and that the second dose is associated with robust neutralising responses. In a clinical trial sub-study specifically looking at older adults vaccinated with BNT162b2 the GMT (geometric mean titre) after first dose was 12 in a set of 12 subjects between ages of 65 and 85 4 , rising to 109 seven days after the second dose, though it was not clear whether some individuals had sub optimal levels after the first dose. It is possible that responses may continue to improve after 3 weeks in some older individuals. Even if this is the case, individuals over 80 are nonetheless likely to be at prolonged increased risk for infection, based on studies in nonhuman primates linking protection from SARS-CoV-2 challenge with neutralising antibody titres 5 . Of note in animal studies the magnitude of T cell responses did not correlate with protection. Finally, although the second dose was able to confer neutralisation of pseudovirus in the poorly responsive individuals, SARS-CoV-2 infection during an enlarged window period between doses in the presence of only partially protective antibody titres could generate conditions for selecting escape mutations 6,7 .",
