Agatston score was also measured, despite technical limitations (no electrocardiographic gating and slice thickness 2.0 mm) (4). Analysis was performed by 2 certified operators blinded to clinical history (1 radiologist and 1 cardiologist). The primary outcome was the first occurrence of mechanical noninvasive or invasive ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or death (scores of 5, 6, and 7 on the World Health Organization Blueprint scale) (5) within 30 days following hospital admission. Because CAC is highly correlated with age, the primary outcome was segmented by median age group. The study was approved by the Paris university hospital ethics committee. Among 356 patients screened, 147 were excluded (54 had previous CV disease, and 93 did not undergo chest computed tomography within 24 h of admission). Ultimately, 209 consecutive patients were included. The median age was 62 years (interquartile range: 51 to 70 years), 72% were men, and all patients were at grade 3 or 4 on the World Health Organization Blueprint scale at entry (hospitalization without or with nasal oxygen). CAC was detected in 106 patients (50.7%). The primary outcome occurred in 50.0% of CAC\u00fe patients compared with 17.5% of CAC\u00c0 patients (p < 0.0001) (Figure 1).

The common complication in patients with cardiac injury was acute respiratory distress syndrome (14 of 26 [63.5%] vs. 15 of 89 [16.8%], respectively; p < 0.001).

Use of empiric therapeutic anticoagulation in certain COVID-19 patients who did not have deep vein thrombosis has been advocated, but this remains controversial because of the risk of major bleeding and lack of data about the true incidence of pulmo-",

This survey was approved by the local ethical committees of both centers and was carried out in accordance with the ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects established by the Declaration of Helsinki, protecting the privacy of all participants. The percentage of diagnosed IE decreased by 33% during the COVID-19 pandemic (47 patients in 2020 vs. 70 patients in 2019) (Figure 1). Furthermore, we observed a worse prognosis in patients diagnosed with IE during the pandemic (i.e., cerebral embolism rate was 18.5% [n \u00bc 13] in 2019 vs. 56% [n \u00bc 26] in 2020). In-hospital IE mortality reached 61% (n \u00bc 29) during the pandemic versus 31% (n \u00bc 22) in 2019, which was similar to EURO-ENDO (European Infective Endocarditis Registry) registry results (2). This probably also underlines that patients were referred late, but this hypothesis requires further analysis. These findings might have several explanations. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, symptoms related to endocarditis might be incorrectly attributed to a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2) infection. Moreover, patients might avoid medical care, and hospital resources might be limited due to reorganization during the crisis. Despite transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) being a very sensitive examination for the diagnosis of IE, current recommendations suggest that its use should be restricted due to high risk of contamination (4). Consequently, we observed a decrease of 49% in the number of TEEs during the pandemic compared with the same time frame in 2019 (498 TEEs in 2019 vs. 244 TEEs in 2020). The substitution of TEE with transthoracic echocardiography might be an explanation for the worse prognosis of patients diagnosed with IE during the pandemic, who potentially have larger vegetations, which might be an indirect gauge of severity.",
