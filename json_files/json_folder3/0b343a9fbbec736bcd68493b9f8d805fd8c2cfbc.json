At the time of the dramatic emergence of bacterial resistance, reducing the selection pressure by reducing the exposure to antibiotics in patients with community-acquired pneumonia is a major public health issue. In this context, the combined use of broad panel respiratory multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) tests that may improve microbiological diagnosis and biomarkers such as procalcitonin for guiding antibiotics discontinuation is attractive. Therefore, we have designed a trial comparing an integrated approach of diagnosis and treatment of severe community-acquired pneumonia to usual care.",

Bacterial microorganisms constitute the main group of pathogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae being the predominant bacterium. However, the role of respiratory viruses has been highlighted in the last decade, with the routine availability of nucleic-acid amplification tests. Therefore, at least four series have reported results from a wide use of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) tests in ICU patients with CAP (7) (8) (9) (10) , with a rate of viral documentation ranging from 23 to 49% of cases.",

Antibiotic therapy has to be reassessed after 48-72 hours of therapy (11, 13, 14) . In case of microbiological documentation, spectrum should be narrowed. This targeting is promoted by scientific societies (11, 15) , and is justified by ecological and economic considerations (13, 16, 17) . However, antibiotic deescalation is only occasionally performed by clinicians in hospitalized patients with CAP (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) . Reasons are many, inherent to beliefs and convictions of clinicians, and to logistical and organizational constraints (23) . Moreover, a beneficial impact of antibiotic de-escalation has not been clearly established in severe CAP (18, 24, 25) . In term of treatment duration, antibiotic therapy in CAP inpatients should not be administered for more than 8 days (11) , and even less (15, 26) , except for cases with documented difficult-to-eradicate bacteria such as P. aeruginosa and S. aureus and complicated, i.e. with excavation or pleural empyema. This duration might be safely shortened to 5 days when clinical response to the treatment is favorable (15, 26) . However, series of inpatients with CAP have reported a median duration of antibiotic treatment of more than 10 days (27, 28 (29) (30) (31) (32) .",

Specifically, its performance to discriminate patients with and without bacterial coinfection during viral pneumonia such as Flu is attractive (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) . To date, only one trial has assessed the therapeutic impact of a proactive diagnostic strategy combining a respiratory mPCR (17 viruses and 3 intracellular bacteria) and the procalcitonin measurement. This single-center randomized controlled trial included 300 inpatients with non-pneumonic lower respiratory tract infections. In the intervention arm, procalcitonin measurement and mPCR were performed, and an usual procalcitonin-guided algorithm of antibiotics discontinuation was proposed to clinicians. The primary endpoint (total duration of antibiotic therapy) did not differ between the two groups (42) .",

If our hypothesis is demonstrated, in terms of efficacy (diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis) and cost-effectiveness, this may change practice and make this proactive diagnostic and therapeutic approach a future standard or care. Indeed, by illustrating the direct benefit to the patient in terms of antibiotic saving and morbidity/mortality such as ICU-acquired superinfections in one hand, and environmental and economic benefits in hospital and across the community on the other hand, we will encourage the use of these tests through the medical community.

In patients with severe CAP, the recommended empirical antibiotic therapy is a combination of broad-spectrum intravenous therapies, targeting Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacterales, Legionella sp. and other atypical micro-organisms (11) (12) (13) . Antibiotic therapy has to be reassessed after 48-72 hours of therapy (11, 13, 14) . In case of microbiological documentation, spectrum should be narrowed. This targeting is promoted by scientific societies (11, 15) , and is justified by ecological and economic considerations (13, 16, 17) . However, antibiotic de-escalation is only occasionally performed by clinicians in hospitalized patients with CAP (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) . Reasons are many, inherent to beliefs and convictions of clinicians, and to logistical and organizational constraints (23) . Moreover, a beneficial impact of antibiotic de-escalation has not been clearly established in severe CAP (18, 24, 25) . In term of treatment duration, antibiotic therapy in CAP inpatients should not be administered for more than 8 days (11), and even less (15, 26) , except for cases with documented difficult-to-eradicate bacteria such as P. aeruginosa and S. aureus and complicated, i.e. with excavation or pleural empyema. This duration might be safely shortened to 5 days when clinical response to the treatment is favorable (15, 26) . However, series of inpatients with CAP have reported a median duration of antibiotic treatment of more than 10 days (27, 28) .",

To date, only one trial has assessed the therapeutic impact of a proactive diagnostic strategy combining a respiratory mPCR (17 viruses and 3 intracellular bacteria) and the procalcitonin measurement. This single-center randomized controlled trial included 300 inpatients with non-pneumonic lower respiratory tract infections. In the intervention arm, procalcitonin measurement and mPCR were performed, and an usual procalcitonin-guided algorithm of antibiotics discontinuation was proposed to clinicians.

Regardless of the procalcitonin values and kinetics, therecommended maximal duration of antibiotics is 7 days, unless otherwise indicated (10-14 days for Staphylococcus aureus, 14 days for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Legionella Sp., and atypical bacteria). When pneumonia is documented, clinicians are encouraged to narrow the spectrum of antibiotics, based on antibiotic sensitivity test, as followed: amoxicillin for Streptococcus pneumoniae, anti-staphylococcal penicillin for Staphylococcus aureus, antipseudomonal \u03b2-lactam plus either anti-pseudomonal fluoroquinolone or amikacin for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, levofloxacin plus rifampicin for Legionella pneumophila, macrolide for other atypical bacteria, \u03b2-lactam plus \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor for enterobacterales, \u03b2-lactam \u00b1 \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor for Haemophilus influenzae.

Finally, in patients still receiving antibiotics, the procalcitonin (values and kinetics) is used day after day, until Day-7 to guide discontinuation (see above). The adherence to the algorithm is collected prospectively from investigators, as well as the reasons for overruling it.
