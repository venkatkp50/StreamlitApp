            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic stretched health care resources to their limit globally, but more so in the lowand middle-income countries (LMICs) that had limited health care resources even before the pandemic. Patients with cancer were a particularly vulnerable group because of the concerns with increased risk of severe infections and death from COVID-19. 1 On the other hand, the diagnosis of cancer itself implies impending mortality for most patients with advanced disease. Experience from India showed that most patients with cancer wanted uninterrupted cancer treatment despite the risk of COVID-19. 2 This required an unprecedented response from health care staff, who had to juggle their own safety and the safety of their families with providing care to patients with cancer during a pandemic. Thus, maintaining oncology services during a pandemic can lead to mental health challenges among health care staff. 3 In this commentary, we discuss the possible sources of psychological stress on health care staff working during COVID-19 in cancer centers in LMICs, drawing examples from India and Nepal, and share the lessons in mitigating the psychological concerns of health care staff learned from the pandemic control exercise at Tata Medical Center, Kolkata, a multidisciplinary cancer center in India.",

Because the burden of cancer in LMICs like India has grown exponentially, and the infrastructural and human resources were limited even before the pandemic, the anxiety of the impending catastrophe preceded the spread of the virus in India. As the pandemic evolved in the neighboring country of China, patients with cancer and health care providers started to mentally prepare for the looming double whammy of COVID and cancer. Information overload and real-time updates of mortality figures from around the world constantly reminded the health care workers in LMICs of the inadequacy of facilities and workforce. That the intensive care units and emergency services from even the best of countries were unable to contain the challenges of the pandemic and that even the most resourceful countries had shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) contributed to substantial anxiety. With the news of health care workers succumbing to the virus in developed countries, health care workers in LMICs like India experienced burden and burnout just in anticipation, even before India had the surge in cases of COVID-19.",

            "text": "At the outset of the pandemic, test facilities for COVID-19 were not widely available in many LMICs, and there was a considerable delay before the definitive test results were available. This created additional pressure of having to care for \"suspected\" patients, increasing psychological stress, although the majority of suspected patients turned out to be negative. Moreover, a shortage of PPE made the health care staff feel vulnerable. 4 The scarcity of hospital beds, inadequate manpower, and unprepared health care infrastructure adversely affected the treatment of non-COVID-19 ailments, including cancer, in countries like India or Nepal. Risk of COVID-19 infection, longer working hours, physical fatigue, loneliness, and shortage of PPE were found to be risk factors for poor psychological health among health care workers. 5 In addition, in oncology, there is often an ethical and psychological dilemma in LMICs while choosing treatment options, because they are dictated not only by disease, biology or evidence but also by socioeconomic challenges. To account for a pandemic on top of these challenges added an extra layer of emotional burden on cancer clinicians. 6 This pandemic has brought forth several other causes of psychological stress among cancer care workers that are unique to LMICs like India and Nepal. Most health care workers do not possess personal vehicles in LMICs. The lockdown in LMICs like India and Nepal also involved a restriction on public transportation. Even routine activities like commuting to work and getting back home on time now became a cause for psychological trauma, a unique scenario that to our knowledge did not occur in any high-income countries Author affiliations and support information (if applicable) appear at the end of this article.",

In some cases commute was impossible, and health care workers had to arrange for a new place of accommodation nearby the hospital, adding to the mental stress and burnout. Outside the hospital, some health care workers faced considerable stigma and felt discriminated against by the community; they were refused entry to their own homes, suddenly kicked out of their apartments, and in rare cases even physically assaulted. 7 In Nepal, on discovery of some physicians testing positive for COVID-19, the community ostracized them by putting up a banner in their home shaming them for bringing the disease to the local community and raising voices to evict physicians from houses where they were self-quarantining. 8 It is thus likely that the causes of psychological stress in cancer care workers in LMICs were multifactorial, depending on the place of work, the specific role of the clinician, and the community's perception of clinicians. One can only imagine the magnitude of psychosocial trauma for health care workers who are working in hospitals with the fear not only of contracting the infection and bringing the infection to their homes and families but also of being physically assaulted or socially ostracized from the community.",

This was perceived to be useful, as most staff could focus on their own work and feel reassured that there was centralized decision making. This team kept the staff updated about relevant practical information for managing the pandemic locally, and the information cascade was done through group e-mails and virtual meetings.",
