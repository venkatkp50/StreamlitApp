Governments around the world have struggled, many unsuccessfully, to manage the crisis or crises that have resulted. This has caused massive disruption to all aspects of human life. The situation has also caused an exacerbation of pre-existing tensions nationally and internationally [1] [2] [3] . Problems created or worsened by the virus were often seen and understood in a mechanical binary fashion that is influenced by the orthodoxy of knowledge [4] . This has had the effect of restricting how policymakers understand and try to address the crisis.",

A crisis situation invariably results in the political call for action in the name of resolving the event through priming and mobilising stakeholder support, which includes the influence of ethics in a crisis. The role of ethics in terms of informing the moral and behavioural approaches to a crisis, which results in conscious choices made that can result in tragic consequences.

Frames are a good and effective means of conveying a sense of crisis to an audience as well as suggesting means to resolve the named crisis.

Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has illustrated the basic fact that the instruments of policy and power remain at the state level, and in spite of rhetoric about global solidarity, there has been relatively little sign of it during the current crisis. Furthermore, socalled democratic leaders have given themselves a great deal of rather autocratic power in a short space of time [1] . Consequently, given the nature and scale of the disruption, the pandemic has been characterised as being a transforming event. Fishman [20] has labelled the pandemic as a Black Swan event (highly improbable, but extremely disruptive-low probability and high impact). The Black Swan characterisation of the COVID-19 pandemic fits perfectly with notions and approaches to the concept of crisis from academic literature [5, 6, 21, 22] . Even though there were some signals before the eruption of the crisis, which has generated a number of policy and governance problems for policymakers.",

The other level of dilemma appears on which value to prioritise, which creates an opportunity cost and can create an uneven or inconsistent policy approach and communication concerning addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. In Sweden's case (but also other countries struggled with this same dilemma), there was the choice between prioritising health of the economy versus public (citizen) safety and health. This policy dithering and dilemma is also influenced by the 'orthodoxy' of policy and practice or group think on the priority and the policy [4] .

The competition between the US and China seemed to increase, to the point that the assumed US role of its self-appointed global leadership began to be questioned. This created considerations and analyses of the US role being tested. But also prompted questions as to whether China can take the global leadership effectively (in terms of international political and economic considerations) 1 . There are predictions that the pandemic will cause the US to unravel as it has destroyed the idea of American exceptionalism 2 . This situation logically infers that one crisis (the pandemic) can create a chain effect through subsequently provoking or activating other crises (such as a geopolitical crisis) as actors position themselves defensively and offensively to a new reality. It was clear that the Liberal value-based mantra of multiculturalism and globalisation came to an abrupt end by the countries that had embraced these as central values before the pandemic, which resulted in a chain of related shocks and crises. The following section shall now move to focus upon the financial and economic realities and consequences of the pandemic and attempts by authorities to address the crisis around the world.",

During the month of March 2020, the Dow Jones fell by some 37%, which exceeded the losses of the global financial crisis [29, p. 2] .

The concern caused by the growing government, corporate and private debt as a result of the pandemic has featured in numerous media reports around the globe. A very small fraction of them, which feature the main arguments are presented here. The Financial Times reported that in the first nine months of 2020, governments and companies increased their borrowing by US$15 trillion, which is characterised as fuelling a \"debt tsunami\" that will create future dire consequences 3 . Other mass media articles featured stories concerning the lack of business confidence among retailers in spite of approaching traditionally peak trading periods, for example, in the United Kingdom 4 . Public spending was down considerably on the previous year owing to a mixture of government policy (shutting down businesses to 'control' the virus) and public fear of the virus. STUDIES Different mass media articles featured news on the depletion of individuals' savings as a result of the pandemic, in the US 30% of big city households have depleted savings due to the pandemic 5 and unemployed are running out of savings accumulated earlier in the pandemic 6 . The issue of people being driven into poverty is a major issue, almost 700000 being put into poverty in the UK by the pandemic 7 . Although, the UK has been held as a bad practice example of crisis management, New Zealand that was globally held as a good example also suffers from increased poverty resulting from COVID-19 financial effects 8 . The issue of the negative economic effects of the pandemic was very diverse on those stakeholders that have been affected adversely as a result of the virus, but also the authorities' crisis management strategy.",

One of these, and a very common one, is the policy of lockdown. An approach that has been used numerous times, but with little in the way of positive results in halting the virus spread and increasing resistance to the approach. One of the actors to criticise the lockdown policy is the World Health Organisation (WHO) that warned lockdowns should only be treated as a final resort and not an initial response to virus outbreaks. WHO envoy Dr David Nabarro stated \"lockdowns just have one consequence that you must never, ever belittle, and that is making poor people an awful lot poorer\". This also affects countries that rely on tourism as a major source of income, arguing that going from lockdown to lockdown was creating a great deal of economic damage and harm to the global economy 9 .

Over 30% of big-city households depleted savings due to pandemic losses (washingtonexaminer.com), 10 September 2020 (accessed 11 September 2020). 6 ineffective policy is apparently illustrated by the experience of South Korea, which never enforced lockdowns and was experiencing a sharp rise in GDP by the end of 2020 10 . Lessons are seemingli ignored and nothing learned from South Korea's good practice that defied the existing orthodoxy of knowledge and practice imposed in European countries and the US. By late 2020, there were reflections and admissions that the response by national governments was inadequate to meet the intended task and goals, countries were not prepared in terms of the state of the physical infrastructure or psychologically, and some responses as being too generic and inflexible, there was also an observable level of international conflict, and a lack of global solidarity and cooperation. Combined these elements and aspects have exposed the weaknesses of numerous governments and authorities 11 . These are the short-term evaluations, analyses and prognoses in non-academic sources concerning the effects of the pandemic and the response.",

These longer-term predictions, especially when it comes to financial and economic crisis predictions, tend to be rather dire in nature.

On the other hand, both act as if the economy is now back on the road to recovery and an improvement is already in sight\" 12 . The use of lockdowns is considered as being highly dangerous and unleashing an unpredictable change of events and developments that may well destroy the economy and society. Linked to this issue is the threat of a looming global debt crisis (started before the pandemic, but exacerbated by the pandemic), which requires a wide-ranging debt relief programme in the middle of a pandemic 13 , where one crisis is current and a creeping crisis is beginning to emerge. This has created the framing of the threat of long-term negative 10 economic consequences caused by poor policymaking and crisis management decisions that are magnified by the pandemic crisis 14 .",

All stakeholders make use of the concept crisis management, and in the spirit of the definition provided in this paper. There are clearly evident, both tangible (physical) and intangible (informational and psychological) aspects of the crisis appearing alongside each other simultaneously. The governments and authorities seem to be in the process of losing the ability to define the frames of the informational representations and cognitive conclusions of the constructed reality of their crisis management efforts and results against the COVID-19 pandemic, which also means that their operational freedom of choice may be restricted at some stage.",

The long-term prognoses tend to be painting a very grim picture, and as a proposed remedy, advocate for much needed financial and economic reforms to mitigate the virus effects on society and to ensure the future of Western civilizational hegemony.
