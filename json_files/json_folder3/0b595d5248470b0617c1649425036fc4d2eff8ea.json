            "text": "Agenda for the Sustainable Development calls for empowering vulnerable groups such as internal migrants to reduce inequalities. 4 As of 2019, China's internal migrant population stood at 236 million. Internal migrants is kind of resident status referring who living outside his place of household registration in China. 5 Household registration, or Hukou, was established in 1955 in order to regulate population mobility and to serve as a basis for allocating resources to specific groups. 6 Access to local welfare benefits, including education, job opportunities, housing, especially health care services remains tied to resident status. [7] [8] [9] [10] This inequality has negatively affected the health status of migrants. 11 The World Health Organization declared the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health to be one of the fundamental rights of every human being. 12 Achieving equity in primary care is the most important thing to achieve the equity of health because primary care can meet people' the most basic medical needs, recognized as an approach to realized health for all. 13 14 Many countries have taken measures to strengthen their primary care systems. 15 16 During the covid-19 emergency, primary care services provided by community health centers (CHCs) helped control the spread of the virus and provide comprehensive and continuity care for patients. 17 18 To improve equity in primary care system, China initiated the 'Equal Access to Public Health Services among Migrants' policy in 2013, which proposed measures to provide primary care services that meet migrants needs. 19 Moreover, the Healthy China 2030 policy calls for Patient' experiences, clinical effectiveness, and patient safety are the three pillars of quality in medical services. 20 But, the quality of primary care services is usually reflected in patient's primary care experiences. To evaluate this, the Primary Care Assessment Tool (PCAT) was developed by John Hopkins Primary Care Policy Center. It has been applied in many countries and has good reliability and validity in China. [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] Prior research has either focused on migrants' health status, needs, and utilization of primary care services in some countries, particularly in Europe, or assessed migrants' primary care experiences and explored related influencing factors. [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] However, the studies comparing the differences of primary care experiences between migrants and residents are so few that it is difficult to determine if there are differences in the quality of primary care received by migrants and residents. One study conducted in Guangzhou has indicated that migrants' and residents' primary care experiences, as assessed by PCAT, seems equal. 24 But, a Shenzhen study used self-made questionnaires to assess the quality of the primary care and found the care to migrants is less satisfactory than that to residents in terms of the attitudes of health workers and waiting times. 33 Our previous studies in the Greater Bay Area have found an association of patients' experiences with usual source of care, types of health care facilities and the institutional primary care services quality. 21 25 Thus, based on our previous findings, we generated hypothesis that resident status may affect the experiences of patients with CHC as usual source of care. We evaluated the primary care experiences of migrants and residents in Guangzhou, the core city of the Greater Bay Area, using the well-established and reliable PCAT and ",

            "text": "The World Health Organization has declared that the achievement of the highest 8 attainable standard of health should become one of the fundamental rights of every human 9 being. 5 Achieving equity in primary care is the most important thing to assure equity in health 10 because primary care can meet people' most basic medical needs and is widely recognized as 11 an approach to realizing health for all. 6 7 Many countries have taken measures to strengthen 12 their primary care systems. 8 9 During the Covid-19 emergency, primary care services 13 provided by community health centers (CHCs) have an important role in controlling the 14 spread of the virus and providing comprehensive and continuity care for patients. 10 11 15 As of 2019, China's internal migrant population stood at 236 million. Internal migrants 16 is a type of resident status and refer to those who live outside their places of household 17 registration in China. 12 Household registration, or Hukou, was established in 1955 in order to 18 regulate population mobility and serve as a basis for allocating resources to specific 19 population groups. 13 Access to local welfare benefits, including education, job opportunities, 20 housing, and health care services in particular remains tied to resident status. [14] [15] [16] [17] Earlier studies have shown that at the beginning of the 21st century, migrants suffered 2 from inadequate allocation of health resources in terms of access to public health services in 3 China. 19 20 Primary care services were unlikely to cover migrants of lower socio-economic 4 status and across provincial boundaries. In January 2009, the Chinese government issued the 5 Opinions on Deepening the Reform of the Health System and launched a new round of health 6 system reform. However, despite this effort, the migrants still made less use of community 7 health services. 21 8 To address this issue and promote health equity in primary care system, China initiated 9 the 'Equal Access to Public Health Services among Migrants' policy in 2013, which 10 proposed measures to provide primary care services to meet migrants' needs. 22 Moreover, the 11 Healthy China 2030 initiative has called for promoting the equalization of primary care 12 services, especially between migrants and local residents. 13 Patients' experiences, clinical effectiveness, and patient safety are the three pillars of 14 quality in medical services. 23 But, the quality of primary care services is usually reflected in 15 patients' primary care experiences. The former evaluates quality from the demand side, while 16 the latter two assess quality from the supply side and the regulatory side. Demand side 17 research usually focuses on the determinants of patient choices. 24 Prior researches have either focused on migrants' health status, needs, and utilization of 5 primary care services in some countries, particularly in Europe, or assessed migrants' primary 6 care experiences and explored related influencing factors. [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] However, the studies 7 comparing the differences of primary care experiences between migrants and local residents 8 have been so few that it is difficult to determine if there were differences in the quality of 9 primary care received by migrants versus local residents. One study conducted in Guangzhou 10 indicated that migrants' and local residents' primary care experiences, as assessed by PCAT, 11 seemed equal. 30 But, a Shenzhen study used self-administered questionnaire to assess the 12 quality of the primary care and found that for migrants, the care was less satisfactory than 13 that for local residents in terms of the attitudes towards healthcare workers and waiting 14 time ",

First, 5 we selected all the four center-urban districts: Liwan, Yuexiu, Tianhe, and Haizhu, and provider settings. 40 We used an unmodified Chinese language version of the original 18 simplified PCAT scale which had a reliability coefficient of 0.963, with an acceptable 19 test-retest reliability coefficient of 0.7 (accepted for publication elsewhere). The PCAT 20 included the following ten domains: First contact-utilization, First contact-access, Ongoing In our study, hukou status was considered a key independent variable, defined as local 11 residents (hukou registered in Guangzhou) or migrants (hukou registered in areas other than 12 Guangzhou). Moreover, we collected individual information including socio-demographic 13 and health-related characteristics with a self-administered questionnaire. Socio-demographic 14 information consisted of age (years), sex (male vs. female), annual average household income 15 (\uffe5) and education level (Uneducated, Primary school, Middle school, High school, College 16 or above). Health-related characteristics included self-perceived health status (good, average 17 or bad), chronic condition (yes vs. no), diabetes condition (yes vs. no), hypertension 18 condition (yes vs. no), type of health insurance (medical insurance for urban and rural 19 residents, medical insurance for employee, business insurance and so on) and annual medical 20 expenditure (\uffe5). The quantitative variables were expressed as means \u00b1 standard deviations and median 3 (interquartile range), and the categorical variables were expressed as absolute numbers and 4 percentages. A generalized linear model was used to evaluate the association between 5 resident status and patients' primary care experiences. A 95% confidence interval was used. 6 The dependent variables used in the model were PCAT score, First contact-utilization score, 7 First contact-access score, Ongoing care score, Coordination (referral) score, Coordination 8 (information) score, Comprehensiveness (services available) score, Comprehensiveness 9 (services provided) score, Family-centeredness score, Community orientation score and 10 Cultural competence score. The independent covariates included were: age, sex, education, 11 annual household income, self-perceived health status, chronic condition, annual medical 12 expenditure, and medical insurance. 27 29 41- 46 No covariate was included in the crude models. 13 Two-side P<0.05 was considered significant. All statistical analyses were performed using 14 IBM SPSS25.0. 15 Patients and public involvement 16 Patients or the public were not involved in the design, conduct, reporting, or dissemination 17 plans of our research. 18 ",

As shown in Table   3 1, most (62.8%) of patients were 60 years or older and 55.8% were female. 11.9% of patients 4 were migrants and 88.1% were local residents. Compared with local residents, lower 5 proportions of migrants were aged 60 or over ( Table 2 shows the mean value \u00b1 standard deviation and median (interquartile range) of the 5 PCAT scores of migrants and local residents, respectively. Among all domains, the score of 6 First Contact-Access domain was the lowest with a mean (\u00b1SD) of 2.97 (\u00b10.74) and a median 7 of 3.00 (range 2.50-3.75). The difference of the total PCAT score between migrants and local 8 residents was statistically significant (Mann-Whitney test, P\uff1c0.001) , as well as scores in all 9 domains. As shown in Figure 1 , migrants scored lower than local residents across all domains 10 on the median indicators. See Appendix 1 for details. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 In this study, we explored the differences in primary care experiences between migrants and 9 local residents. Migrants' primary care experiences scores were significantly lower than local 10 residents' in total and in the following domains: First contact-utilization, Ongoing care, 11 Community orientation, Family-centeredness, and Cultural competence after adjusting for 12 patient sociodemographic characteristics. 13 The finding that migrants had worse primary care experiences is congruent with some 14 published studies elsewhere. 47 But, another research demonstrated that migrants were equal 15 to local residents in terms of overall experiences of primary care. 30 The inconsistency could 16 have resulted from differences between studies in their inclusion and exclusion criteria for 17 patients and the sample size. Shenzhen's 611 CHCs for initial care. Establishing a medical insurance system for migrants 8 that encourages them to use CHCs as their first-contact institution and improving the medical 9 services of those CHCs could be an effective policy option. 10 Family doctors should also embrace the concept of taking care of migrants. Although the 11 difference in First contact-access domain scores between migrants and local residents was not 12 statistically significant, it's worth noting that this was the lowest score for both groups. A 13 previous study showed that, compared with local residents, fewer migrants were entitled to 14 with current CHCs. 6 In this study, the difference between migrants and local residents in terms of Cultural 7 competence domain was significant. Cultural differences are important barriers to accessing 8 healthcare services not only for internal migrants but also for international migrants, which 9 has long been studied and discussed by scholars. 55 56 Barriers to effective and equitable 10 healthcare can result from linguistic differences between patients and doctors. 57 It is crucial to 11 accurately convey risk factors of disease when communicating the details of a diagnosis or 12 treatment. 58 Hence, family doctors in Guangzhou should learn to speak in Mandarin, the 13 national dialect, rather than rely on Cantonese, a local dialect. But dialect is just one aspect of 14 culture, and the other aspects of culture, religion for example, may also influence migrants' 15 primary care experiences. Further study should be conducted. 16 In addition, the migrants' primary care experiences were significantly worse off than 17 local residents in the Family-centered care and Community-orientation domains. A large 18 number of studies have shown that Family-centered care was an important way of meeting 19 the needs of family members. 59 Community-oriented care takes into account the healthcare 20 needs of not only the patients and their families but also local residents in the community. 21 The likely reason for migrants' worse experiences in the Community-oriented care domain 22 might be due to work overload by family doctors which was a major barrier to regularly showed that the social integration of migrants was often poor, which could affect their 4 community health services experiences. 60 5 Therefore, to close the gap between migrants and local residents, policymakers should 6 accelerate reform of the household registration system, deepen reform of the healthcare 7 system and focus on improving migrants' primary care experiences, especially in terms of 8 utilization, continuity and cultural competence. Importantly, policies should be made to 9 mitigate the impacts of cultural differences and language barriers on migrants seeking 10 medical services. 11 By examining the association between resident status and patients' primary care 12 experiences in urban area using an internationally established PCAT scale, this study was 13 significant for health promotion in vulnerable groups. However, there were still a number of 14 limitations with our study. The study did not capture all potentially significant confounding 15 factors influencing the association of resident status and patients' primary care experiences. 16 An example was the type and duration of residence. A local resident born in local and a local 17 resident not born in local could have different experiences of primary care. Similarly, the 18 duration of local residence might also matter. A migrant with lengthy local residence might 19 have better assimilated into local culture than migrants with short local residence. Although 20 we tried to minimize the bias by adjusting the sociodemographic and health characteristics, 21 our study still showed a significant relationship between resident status and patients' 22 experiences in cultural competence. Another limitation of the study was its lack of In conclusion, this study indicated that migrants' primary care experiences were worse 5 off than those of local residents in Guangzhou, China, providing evidence for further study 6 about quality of primary care at a national level. There is still a long way to go to achieve the 7 goal of equitable and accessible primary care services for all in Healthy China 2030. 8 Furthermore, the findings could also be relevant to America, Australia, Europe and other 9 countries that accommodate many migrants with different cultures. Promoting the equality 10 between migrants and local residents in China is significant for achieving the goal of health 11 for all and improving global equity. ",

[14] [15] [16] [17] This kind of 21 inequality has negatively affected the health status of migrants. 18 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 To address this issue and promote health equity in primary care system, China initiated 9 the 'Equal Access to Public Health Services among Migrants' policy in 2013, which 10 proposed measures to provide primary care services to meet migrants' needs. 22 Moreover, the 11 Healthy China 2030 initiative has called for promoting the equalization of primary care 12 services, especially between migrants and local residents. 13 Patients' experiences, clinical effectiveness, and patient safety are the three pillars of 14 quality in medical services. 23 But, the quality of primary care services is usually reflected in 15 patients' primary care experiences. The former evaluates quality from the demand side, while 16 the latter two assess quality from the supply side and the regulatory side. Demand side 17 research usually focuses on the determinants of patient choices. 24 25 Our study aimed to 18 change patients' perception, choice and behavior of medical treatment by improving patients' 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 Prior researches have either focused on migrants' health status, needs, and utilization of 5 primary care services in some countries, particularly in Europe, or assessed migrants' primary 6 care experiences and explored related influencing factors. [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] However, the studies 7 comparing the differences of primary care experiences between migrants and local residents 8 have been so few that it is difficult to determine if there were differences in the quality of 9 primary care received by migrants versus local residents. One study conducted in Guangzhou 10 indicated that migrants' and local residents' primary care experiences, as assessed by PCAT, 11 seemed equal. 30 But, a Shenzhen study used self-administered questionnaire to assess the 12 quality of the primary care and found that for migrants, the care was less satisfactory than 13 that for local residents in terms of the attitudes towards healthcare workers and waiting 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 ",

Table 2 shows the mean value \u00b1 standard deviation and median (interquartile range) of the 5 PCAT scores of migrants and local residents, respectively. Among all domains, the score of 6 First Contact-Access domain was the lowest with a mean (\u00b1SD) of 2.97 (\u00b10.74) and a median 7 of 3.00 (range 2.50-3.75). The difference of the total PCAT score between migrants and local domains. As shown in Figure 1 , migrants scored lower than local residents across all domains 3 on the median indicators. See Appendix 1 for details. In this study, we explored the differences in primary care experiences between migrants and 9 local residents. Migrants' primary care experiences scores were significantly lower than local 10 residents' in total and in the following domains: First contact-utilization, Ongoing care, 11 Community orientation, Family-centeredness, and Cultural competence after adjusting for 12 patient sociodemographic characteristics. 13 The finding that migrants had worse primary care experiences is congruent with some 14 published studies elsewhere. 47 But, another research demonstrated that migrants were equal 15 to local residents in terms of overall experiences of primary care. 30 The inconsistency could 16 have resulted from differences between studies in their inclusion and exclusion criteria for 17 patients and the sample size. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 Shenzhen's 611 CHCs for initial care. Establishing a medical insurance system for migrants 8 that encourages them to use CHCs as their first-contact institution and improving the medical 9 services of those CHCs could be an effective policy option. 10 Family doctors should also embrace the concept of taking care of migrants. Although the 11 difference in First contact-access domain scores between migrants and local residents was not 12 statistically significant, it's worth noting that this was the lowest score for both groups. A 13 previous study showed that, compared with local residents, fewer migrants were entitled to 14 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 with current CHCs. 6 In this study, the difference between migrants and local residents in terms of Cultural 7 competence domain was significant. Cultural differences are important barriers to accessing 8 healthcare services not only for internal migrants but also for international migrants, which 9 has long been studied and discussed by scholars. 55 56 Barriers to effective and equitable 10 healthcare can result from linguistic differences between patients and doctors. 57 It is crucial to 11 accurately convey risk factors of disease when communicating the details of a diagnosis or 12 treatment. 58 Hence, family doctors in Guangzhou should learn to speak in Mandarin, the 13 national dialect, rather than rely on Cantonese, a local dialect. But dialect is just one aspect of 14 culture, and the other aspects of culture, religion for example, may also influence migrants' 15 primary care experiences. Further study should be conducted. 16 In addition, the migrants' primary care experiences were significantly worse off than 17 local residents in the Family-centered care and Community-orientation domains. A large 18 number of studies have shown that Family-centered care was an important way of meeting 19 the needs of family members. 59 Community-oriented care takes into account the healthcare 20 needs of not only the patients and their families but also local residents in the community. 21 The likely reason for migrants' worse experiences in the Community-oriented care domain 22 might be due to work overload by family doctors which was a major barrier to regularly 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   20   1 provide other community-oriented services for migrants or to visit patients' homes. The 2 migrants' weak connection with the community might be another barrier. A recent study 3 showed that the social integration of migrants was often poor, which could affect their 4 community health services experiences. 60 5 Therefore, to close the gap between migrants and local residents, policymakers should 6 accelerate reform of the household registration system, deepen reform of the healthcare 7 system and focus on improving migrants' primary care experiences, especially in terms of 8 utilization, continuity and cultural competence. Importantly, policies should be made to 9 mitigate the impacts of cultural differences and language barriers on migrants seeking 10 medical services. 11 By examining the association between resident status and patients' primary care 12 experiences in urban area using an internationally established PCAT scale, this study was 13 significant for health promotion in vulnerable groups. However, there were still a number of 14 limitations with our study. The study did not capture all potentially significant confounding 15 factors influencing the association of resident status and patients' primary care experiences. 16 An example was the type and duration of residence. A local resident born in local and a local 17 resident not born in local could have different experiences of primary care. Similarly, the 18 duration of local residence might also matter. A migrant with lengthy local residence might 19 have better assimilated into local culture than migrants with short local residence. Although 20 we tried to minimize the bias by adjusting the sociodemographic and health characteristics, 21 our study still showed a significant relationship between resident status and patients' 22 experiences in cultural competence. Another limitation of the study was its lack of 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 In conclusion, this study indicated that migrants' primary care experiences were worse 5 off than those of local residents in Guangzhou, China, providing evidence for further study 6 about quality of primary care at a national level. There is still a long way to go to achieve the 7 goal of equitable and accessible primary care services for all in Healthy China 2030. 8 Furthermore, the findings could also be relevant to America, Australia, Europe and other 9 countries that accommodate many migrants with different cultures. Promoting the equality 10 between migrants and local residents in China is significant for achieving the goal of health 11 for all and improving global equity. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 4 Data supplement 2: Figure S1 The Scores of PCAT of participants (mean) 5 6 Supplemental material: This content has been supplied by the author(s).

Migrants seemed less likely than residents to know of, or to be able to use primary care services. 32 38 42 But, a recent study in Shenzhen has shown that migrants are more inclined to consider CHCs as their first point of contact.33 The difference may account for Shenzhen's Medical Insurance System for Migrant Employees which requires employed migrants to contact one of Shenzhen's 611 CHCs for care. Establishing a medical insurance system for migrants that encourages them to use CHCs as their first visit institution and improving the medical services of those CHCs could be effective policy choices.Family doctors should give full play to the initiative of taking care of migrants. Although the difference in First contact-access domain scores between migrants and residents was not significant, it's worth noting this was the lowest score for both groups. A previous study has shown that, compared with residents, fewer migrants are entitled to sick pay in China.43  This can lead to a larger role for after-hours primary care. In similar circumstances, a Dutch primary care physicians' cooperative reorganized its organizational model to provide after-hours care that satisfied both the professionals and their patients.44 Whether this model can be applied in China requires further investigation.In the Ongoing care domain, migrants scored significantly lower than residents in our study. This finding is in line with a study in Europe suggesting migrants are likely to report less continuity of care than native patients. 45 This is perhaps due to migrants having more negative patient-doctor communications and lacking of awareness of health behaviors and links with CHCs.46 47 Interpersonal continuity has been associated with improved preventive care and reduced hospitalization.48  Family doctors should classify migrants as a key population, actively interact with them, know well their health status, and give corresponding care.

But language is just one aspect of culture, and further study of the other aspects of culture influencing migrants' primary care experiences should be conducted.In addition, the migrants' primary care experiences were significantly worse off than residents in the Family-Centered Care and Community-Oriented domains. A large number of studies have shown that Family-centered care is an important way of meeting the needs of family members and then benefits patients and families. 53 Community-oriented care takes into account the health care needs of not only the patients and their families but also residents in the community. The likely reason for migrants' more worse experiences in the Community-Oriented domain is family doctors' overload work which is a crucial barrier to spend enough time to visit patients' homes or to regularly provide other community-oriented services for migrants. The migrant's weak connection with the community may be another barrier to improve primary care experiences. The study has recently shown that the social integration of",
