After fitting the model parameters using recorded infections up to July 15, they provide forecasts for the future. Their forecasts proved completely wrong with respect to the actual evolution of the epidemic. Already at the time of submission of the paper the cumulative numbers of infection had exceeded the upper bound of what the authors report in the figures of the paper. The inconsistency between their expectation and reality can be appreciated by looking at the reported infection and the range considered by the authors.",

This clearly shows how the authors' analysis is not sufficiently careful and that, with the data available at the moment of submission (and most likely now too) their methods and fitting should absolutely not be used to make forecasts. This fact alone is sufficient to recommend the rejection of the paper. Below, you will find specific comments concerning the modeling approach and other remarks.",

The choice of a step-wise probability of recovery P differs, as the authors mention, from the exponentially decaying profile usually used for compartmental model like the classic SIR one. The author should motivate more clearly why they think the step-like profile is more realistic for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic than the exponential profile. They should also discuss how much their results and predictions depend on this specific choice and what qualitative difference they expect from the usually employed exponential choice.",

As common in similar approaches, there is some arbitrariness in how the time dependence of transmission rate is chosen. It is then difficult to make reliable forecasts based on these highly simplified models with several assumptions on the transmission rates that are hard to properly justify. Resorting to publicly available mobility data can guide the modeling, even though, it remains difficult to capture seasonality effects and the influence of other containment measures not based on reducing mobility (such as face-mask wearing). The authors should comment on this. I would invite the authors to take this aspect into account or to motivate in the paper why they do not think it is relevant for their analysis.",
