Previous papers have given recommendations of protection of medical staff while working in hospitals and clinics facing the new disease (1) (2) (3) (4) , but what was recommended after they left work and returned to their residences was barely mentioned. Actually, it is crucial for the protection for medical staff themselves, their families, and also public health. We hereby share our experience about the designed after-work protocols that protected 482 medical staff that were sent from Changsha to Wuhan and to a locally designated hospital to support the medical system from the highly contagious COVID-19.",
