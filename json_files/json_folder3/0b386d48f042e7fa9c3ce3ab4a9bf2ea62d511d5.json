Method: 200 healthy control samples and 48 individuals with other antibody-positive disorders (18 hepatitis/18 dengue/11 ANA/1 dsDNA) served to assess for potential cross-reactivity. Anonymised residual leftover sera positive for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR were recruited as cases (N \u00bc 133). The sensitivity/specificity/cross-reactivity of the Architect IgM assay were assessed. Concordance between the 3 assays were also analysed. Results: There was no cross-reactivity with controls and other antibody positive samples. The Architect IgM assay was 100% specific (95% CI 98.5 to 100) and sensitivity was 77.8% (95% CI 60.8 to 89.9) !14 days post-first positive RT-PCR (POS). Sensitivity of the combined Architect IgM and IgG results (30.8%) was significantly better than the Cobas total antibodies (15.4%) in early disease (p \u00bc 0.04). While the Architect IgM assay had moderate agreement with the Cobas total antibody result (Cohen's kappa 0.72), a combined Architect IgM and IgG result had better agreement (Cohen's kappa 0.83). Conclusion: The Architect IgM assay has good specificity and no cross-reactivity with other antibody positive cases. A combined Architect IgM and IgG result has better sensitivity than the individual assays for early COVID-19. The Architect IgM assay is not comparable to the Cobas total antibody assay, but the Architect IgM and IgG combined result has good agreement with the Cobas assay.",

RT-PCR testing only has a sensitivity of around 79% at best [2] , with a false-negative rate of 38% on the day of disease onset, decreasing to 20% on day 8 of disease onset [3] . The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends serologic assays for use in monitoring the pandemic [4] and in suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases with negative RT-PCR, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommended that serologic testing could be used in patients with a high clinical suspicion for COVID-19 but with negative RT-PCR results two weeks post-symptom onset and for sero-surveillance studies [5] . Serology thus has a role as a possible adjunct to RT-PCR testing. IgM levels can rise as early as day 5 post disease onset in patients with mild disease [6] and increase significantly in patients with severe COVID-19 [7] . It is also possible for patients or close-contacts who are RT-PCR negative to have virus-specific IgM in initial samples [8] .",

In addition, 48 pre-pandemic/current antibody positive samples (18 viral hepatitis [B or C or E] (taken in 2020), 18 dengue (taken in 2020), 11 anti-nuclear antibody [ANA] and 1 double-stranded-DNA antibody [dsDNA] (prepandemic)) were used to assess for potential cross-reactivity. All pre-pandemic samples were non-reactive on the Architect IgG and Cobas assays, and all cross-reactivity samples taken in 2020 had COIs comparable to pre-pandemic samples, establishing that they were likely to be free of COVID-19. Residual de-identified sera from other routine laboratory testing (e.g. renal panels, blood cell counts) in subjects who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR from April to June 2020 were recruited as cases (N \u00bc 133) (see Fig. 1 ). 78 RT-PCR positive samples were repeat sample from 27 patients. All samples were stored at \u00c070 degrees Celcius, being freeze-thawed only once before. Days post-first positive RT-PCR (POS) was used as a surrogate for disease onset, and results stratified according to days POS. Demographics of the cases and control subjects are displayed in Table 1 . As this work involved de-identified leftover sera and was part of evaluating new diagnostic assays and seroprevalence surveillance, it was deemed exempt by our institutional review board.",

The stated cut-off index (COI) of the Architect IgG assay is 1.4. In our own evaluation, the assay sensitivity for samples !14 days POS is 96.7%, and for samples <7 days is 45.9% [9] . The Roche anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay is a non-competitive sandwich immunoassay, also described previously [10] , with a stated COI of 1.0. In our own evaluation [10] , the assay specificity was 99.9%, and the assay sensitivity was 97.1% when !14 days POS and 48.2% when <7 days POS. Both the Abbott IgG assay and Roche total antibody assay target antibodies directed against the viral nucleocapsid. For RT-PCR testing, our hospital molecular laboratory employs a duplex real-time RT-PCR that targets the N and E genes using a Qiagen EZ1 extraction system and Rotor Gene Q amplification system. The Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibody assay also utilizes a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay similar to the Architect IgG assay but targets the IgM antibodies directed against the spike antigens on the virion. In a chemiluminescent reaction, relative light units directly proportional to the amount of SARS-CoV-2 IgM titres is reflected as a COI; a COI above 1.0 connotes reactivity. The manufacturer reported precision of the assay (CV) is 2.8 (at COI 1.96) and 2.9% (at COI 2.80), with a reported sensitivity of 59.5% (0-7 days POS) to 100% (>14 days POS) and a specificity of 99.6% in the package insert.",

            "text": "On its own, the Architect IgM assay has moderate sensitivity (26.2%) for antibody detection within the first week of infection, increasing in the second week to 71.9% and peaks at 77.8% thereafter. This is in keeping with other studies [11] , where IgM levels peak in the second week after symptom onset and may even decline by the third week. In another study the sensitivity of the Abbott IgM assay from positive PCR results was 63.6% at day 0 (n \u00bc 22), 76.5% at day1-5 (n \u00bc 17), 76.3% at day 6-14 (n \u00bc 38), 85.2% at day 15-30 (n \u00bc 54), and 63.6% over 30 days (n \u00bc 44) [12] . However, the best value of the Architect IgM is in antibody detection in early disease [12] , where we noted its higher sensitivity compared to the Cobas assay (15.4%). This is also supported by other studies in larger cohorts [13] . In a study of 972 hospitalized patients and 586 normal volunteers, the sensitivity of IgM was 82.54% in the first week of infection, compared with 80.95% with IgG. In another study evaluating the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG assays in 300 control samples and 1349 sequential samples from 427 RT-PCR positive patients [14] , the clinical test sensitivity of the IgM and IgG assay was 24.6% and 23.2% in the first week of infection, and the positive rate was 30.8% and 92.3% at >3 months later. The sensitivity of the Architect IgM in early disease is further improved by combining it with the Architect IgG results. For cases at 0-6 days POS, this combined result increases the sensitivity of antibody detection from 26.2% to 30.8%, exceeding that of the Cobas total antibody (15.4%) and Abbott IgG (10.8%) assays. The sensitivity of the Cobas total antibody assay was marginally higher than the individual Architect IgG and IgM results in the total population. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the combined Architect IgM and IgG results exceeded 95% after 14 days POS. Other studies [8] have also reported that a combined assessment of IgG and IgM (with positive IgG and/or IgM considered as reactive) offers a higher sensitivity than testing for either IgG or IgM alone in the early stages of COVID-19. A recent Cochrane review [15] reported that the combination of IgG and IgM had a sensitivity of 30.1% within the first week of COVID-19, rising to 72.2% by the second week and 91.4% after that. The Cochrane review noted that individual IgG and IgM testing had a low sensitivity <30.1% in the first week of infection. The findings of the Cochrane review are fairly similar to the progression of the combined Architect IgG and IgM sensitivity found in our study. Differences between the combined Abbott IgG with IgM result and the Cobas total antibody sensitivities can be attributed to differences in assay design: the Abbott IgM assay targets spike-antibodies, whereas the Roche total antibody and Abbott IgG assays target nucleocapsid antibodies. There is some evidence that spike assays may have increased sensitivity compared to nucleocapsid assays [16] .",

            "text": "One limitation of our study is that it is comprised of a hospital population. The serological status was compared to the timing of RT-PCR positivity and not relative to timing of symptom onset. We are thus unable to account for any delays between start of infection and RT-PCR. However, the use of RT-PCR as a surrogate for disease onset would include subjects who are possibly asymptomatic (as we do not have the clinical history of the deidentified samples). The proportion of males is substantially higher in our cases, as this reflects the real-world male preponderance of more severe COVID-19 [23] . The higher proportion of females in our control population will not have affected our analysis, as all their COIs were below the LOD. In the general population, SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses might be lower due to a higher number of asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic infections [24] [25] [26] . In one study [27] , 38 patients with severe COVID-19 were compared to 24 mild COVID-19 infections; 65% of severe cases demonstrated antibody activity, compared to 30% in mild cases. Liu et al. [21] showed a significant difference in the IgG response between patients with mild and severe infection. In some mild cases (21.43%), IgG antibodies did not develop until 9 days after symptom onset. Thus, assay sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV might be affected by differences in antibody titres and disease prevalence between hospital and general populations. The sensitivities of the Architect IgG and Cobas total antibody assays are lower than that in our previous evaluations [9, 10] . This is because the population of RT-PCR positive cases in this evaluation is different (e.g. age and gender) and smaller than our previous studies (133 cases in the present evaluation compared to 349 cases for Cobas and 279 cases for Architect IgG). Another limitation is that our study showed that the assay had 100% specificity which would lead to overly optimistic PPV (100%), as shown in Supplementary Table 2 . This may be due to our study having too few controls, with a larger proportion of controls coming from healthy volunteers, rather than more samples with cross-reacting antibodies. The manufacturer reported assay specificity is 99.6%, as they used a large population of 2965 controls, including subjects with various conditions such as hemodialysis, influenza, lupus and other respiratory viruses. A specificity of 99.6% would result in a PPV of 86.0% with all our cases (68 positive and 65 nega tive cases on the Architect IgM) if the disease prevalence were 5%. We also observed that, if the specificity were not 100%, the PPV would evolve with days POS (0-6 days POS 75.8%, !14 days POS 90.3%). The difference in PPV and NPV is further exacerbated in populations with lower disease prevalence, as the PPV would naturally decrease with prevalence and the NPV would exceed its already high value. However, with a 100% PPV, the predictive value remains static and does not change with days POS or disease prevalence. As such, further evaluations of the Architect IgM assay involving a larger number of subjects would be desirable. The FDA also recommends that it is important to assess cross-reactivity not only with viral hepatitis, but also other corona viruses, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, and to obtain a minimum of 5 individual samples for each antibody class [27] . We had no access to such samples. However, the manufacturer and other publications [28, 29] have explored cross-reactivity with other corona viruses extensively, and report little evidence of cross-reactivity.",

Between-test agreements were assessed by interpretation of Cohen's Kappa-statistics. Statistical analyses were performed using MedCalc\u00ae Statistical Software version 19.5.3 (MedCalc Software Ltd, Ostend, Belgium). For the 95% confidence interval in groups with 100% PPV, we used Stata 14 software (StataCorp. 2015. Stata Statistical Software: Release 14. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP).
