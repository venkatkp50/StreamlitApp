Notably, pro-inflammatory cytokine levels seem to be lower in SARS-CoV-2-than in sepsis-induced ARDS [6] . COVID-19 is also associated with lymphopenia, with a more pronounced depletion of CD8 T cells, and lymphocyte count is inversely correlated with severity [3, [7] [8] [9] , an association also demonstrated in sepsis [10] . The lymphopenia in COVID-19 may be more prolonged than in other viral infections [8] . Little is known about the cause of lymphopenia and whether T-cell responses are helpful or harmful in COVID-19 [8] . Interleukin 7 (IL-7) known to restore lymphocyte counts and repertoire in lymphopenia [8] may be a potential target for therapeutics in COVID-19.",

Alveolarresiding monocytes and macrophages may be infected by SARS-CoV-2 through angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE-2)-dependent or independent pathways [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Grant et al. argue that the infection results in release of T-cell chemoattractants creating a positive feedback loop that drives alveolar inflammation, possible facilitating dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 in the lungs [18] . Whether ACE-2-expression in circulating monocytes is associated with COVID-19 severity remains unknown. Mononuclear phagocyte dysregulations associated with severe COVID-19 have recently been documented [21] . Further, a relative and absolute decrease in classical (CD14 ++ CD16 -) and non-classical (CD14 + CD16 ++ ) monocytes to the advantage of intermediate monocytes (CD14 ++ CD16 + ) has been reported in severe COVID-19 [21] [22] [23] [24] . Still, a conflicting study finds an increase in classical and non-classical monocytes [16] . Thus, the distribution and relevance of the various monocyte lineages and subsets in COVID-19 infection are not finally determined.",

The three most differentially regulated pathways were 'immune response-activating signal transduction' (GO0002757), 'leucocyte activation involved in immune response' (GO0002366) and 'mRNA processing' (GO0006397) (Figs 4c and S8B and D) . In the GO pathway 'immune response-activating signal transduction', only seven transcripts that were differentially expressed were higher in the critical compared with the mild/moderate COVID-19 group, including pro-inflammatory calprotectin (S100A8/9). There were lower levels of transcripts associated with regulatory functions (NFkB inhibitor zeta), apoptosis inhibitor genes such as BIRC and cell signalling (MAPK, NFkB, CREBBP, RAP1A) in critical compared with mild/moderate COVID-19 patients (Fig. 4d and e) .",

IL-7Ra expression decreased with COVID-19 severity correlating to respiratory function. T-cell exhaustion marker PD-1 was higher in critical COVID-19 than in septic patients with bacterial infections. In monocytes, the expression of PD-L1 and ACE-2 and the fraction of pro-inflammatory classical monocytes increased, while mHLA-DR expression and the fraction of anti-inflammatory non-classical monocytes decreased with COVID-19 severity. Transcriptomic analyses revealed changes in pathways of both innate and adaptive immune responses.

Surprisingly, there was a low amount of differentially expressed transcripts comparing mild/moderate to severe disease. In contrast, a large number of differentially expressed transcripts were found in mild vs severe COVID-19 in a recent study [45] . However, stratification of the clinical groups will affect the results and the severe COVID-19 group in the report from Aschenbrenner et al., corresponds to our critical COVID-19 group and highlights the need for a common stratification of COVID-19 severity as well as further in-depth studies on the transcriptome. Interestingly, Calprotectin (S100A8/9), a potent alarmin and driver of innate immune response [46] , was significantly higher in critical patients. Calprotectin has recently been suggested as a biomarker for COVID-19 severity [24] . The findings of increased [47, 48] . While plasma B cells may produce neutralizing antibodies, they were also associated with severe disease and mortality [49] . Studies of B-cell function and as a source of long-term antibody production for protection are needed to determine their role in acute COVID-19. Further, critical patients in general displayed lower levels of transcripts involved in regulation, apoptosis and cell signalling compared with mild/moderate disease.",

Our study showed that IL-7Ra expression was significantly reduced with increased COVID-19 severity, correlated with respiratory function measured as P/F and was comparable to levels found in septic patients. Further, transcripts of ILR7 were lower in critical COVID-19. This may represent a dysfunctional immune response in septic patients suggestive of immune suppression [50] . Further, low levels of IL-7Ra in people living with HIV lead to decreased T-cell survival and proliferation [51] . We have previously shown that the plasma levels of soluble IL-7 are increased in COVID-19, but with no difference between the clinical severity groups [5] . Thus, we argue that cellular IL-7Ra, rather than soluble IL-7 levels, is predictive of COVID-19 severity and as infection progresses T cells develop a unique exhausted phenotype characterized by loss of IL-7Ra. IL-7 therapy, shown to restore lymphocyte count and repertoire diversity in sepsis, could serve as a possible host-directed therapy for advanced COVID-19 [52] . Three ongoing randomized controlled clinical trials are exploring IL-7 therapy for COVID-19 (clinicaltrials.org) and our data support further investigation of IL-7 as therapy.",

We demonstrate an increased expression of PD-1 on T cells in COVID-19, but evenly distributed across the COVID-19 severity groups, also questioning the degree of T-cell exhaustion in critical COVID-19 [26] . However, PD-L1 on monocytes increased with COVID-19 severity, and in deteriorating patients during the first week of follow-up, whereas in patients whose P/F improved there was a decrease in the expression of PD-L1. T-cell depletion and exhaustion have been reported to underlay severe disease in SARS-CoV-infected mice [54] and possibly mediated through the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway [55] . Our findings may indicate that the continued increase in PD-L1 may come as a result of increased disease severity and contribute to T-cell suppression via the PD-1/PD-L1 signalling axis also reported by others [56] ; however, the precise role of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway and characteristics of T cells in COVID-19 pathology should be explored in future studies.",

We observed a decrease in mHLA-DR expression with decreasing respiratory function, indicating less antigen-presenting activity in more severe COVID-19. Although volatile, mHLA-DR expression overall persisted over time in COVID-19 as previously shown [56] . Moreover, our data showing comparable levels in critical COVID-19 and sepsis are in contrast to another study reporting higher expression of mHLA-DR in COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU than in sepsis [65] . SARS-CoV-2 may enter the cells via ACE-2 expressed on alveolar monocytes and macrophages to gain intracellular access [16, 18, 19] and this may contribute to morbidity in COVID-19 [18, 66, 67] . We report higher levels of ACE-2 expression on circulating monocytes in COVID-19 patients compared with healthy individuals, suggesting that these cells may be susceptible for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The underlying mechanisms, however, need further investigation [17] .",

Likewise, only a fraction of the cohort was followed due to logistical constraints and discharge from the hospital. Methodologically, our flow cytometry analyses were limited to T cells and monocytes and phenotyping of Tregs and T-cell subsets were crude without the use of markers such as FOXP3 or detailed maturity markers. Further, p-values were not corrected for multiple testing on data from the flow cytometry analyses and should be interpreted thereafter. If applying a conservative Bonferroni adjustment for the number of tests (37) , then only the correlations between LD and Tregs PD-1 and Ferritin and mHLA-DR remain significant. Still, our exploratory study presents several interesting findings that could lay grounds for further functional in vitro studies of larger cohorts addressing in-depth cell properties to determine cell subset functionality in COVID-19.",

Further, in critical COVID-19, pathways of both adaptive and innate immune responses are activated on a transcriptional level with increased transcripts of pro-inflammatory mediators and increased numbers of plasma B cells that may have altered functionality. Our findings indicate an altered innate and adaptive immune phenotype in critical COVID-19, contributing to the increasing knowledge on COVID-19 pathogenesis. Nevertheless, further in-depth studies of regulatory and functional mechanisms are required to identify targets for therapeutic intervention.",
