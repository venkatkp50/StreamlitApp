            "text": "Convenient, sensitive and specific detection of rare genetic variants and mutations is essential for early cancer diagnosis and precision medicine [1] , but tools that are simultaneously endowed with all these attributes remain elusive despite years of intense quest. Recently, Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) associated (Cas) proteins have shown great potential for rapid and sensitive nucleic acid detection [2] [3] [4] [5] . Guided by a CRISPR-derived RNA (crRNA) complementary to the target sequence, the CRISPR/Cas complex can recognize and cleave the target nucleic acid with single-base resolution specificity [6] . Cas12a is one of the most commonly used CRISPR/Cas proteins for DNA detection. Upon recognition and cleavage of target double-strand DNA, the collateral cleavage activity of Cas12a is activated, resulting in cleavage of nearby single-strand DNA (including fluorescence reporters) in a non-specific manner [7] , and this \"collateral cleavage\" has been widely exploited for sensitive and specific detection of target sequences [8, 9] . However, for detection of rare mutations in cancers, the majority of the DNA are wildtype (WT) sequences, significantly hampering the analysis. We have now solved the problem by simply including restriction digestion in the detection system, making our method (EasyCatch, for Excision-amplification-synchronous Cas12a-targeted checkout) the first capable of convenient, specific, sensitive (0.001%), and rapid (< 1 h) detection of mutations in cancer samples.",

We hypothesized that by adding a restriction enzyme recognizing the WT sequence to the RPA system, we can destroy the interfering sequences, and thereby inhibit the amplification of the WT sequences while facilitate the amplification of mutant templates, thus increasing the detection sensitivity (Fig. 1a) . This strategy is the basis of EasyCatch.",

To screen for the optimal crRNA for detecting FLT3-D835Y, we designed four crRNAs, with FLT3-D835Y-crRNA1 perfectly matching the mutant sequence and FLT3-D835Y-crRNA2 ~ 4 bearing various mismatches (Fig. 1b) . We compared the sensitivity and specificity of these four crRNAs in detecting D835Y in PCR fragments (1e10 copies) comprising the D835Y and WT alleles. After 30 min of the Cas12a reaction, all the 4 crRNAs, particularly crRNA1 and crRNA2, could detect the sample with 100% D835Y, while crRNA1 but not crRNA2 produced a strong signal even for WT sample ( Fig. 1c; S2 ). Thereby crRNA2 is the optimal crRNA for D835Y detection based on its excellent sensitivity and specificity. Optimal crRNAs for D835H/V/F and WT were similarly identified, which are D835H-crRNA2, D835V-crRNA2, D835F-crRNA, WT-crRNA2, respectively ( Fig. 1d ; S3-6), and an inner control (IC)-crRNA was also designed to target a non-mutation sequence near the mutation site. To simplify the diagnosis of the four mutations, we pooled the D835Y/H/V/F crRNAs (MMT-crRNAs) and the 4 mutant fragments into a single reaction, resulting in a strong fluorescence signal, whereas the WT sample did not show any signal, as expected ( Fig. 1e , f; S7).",

In contrast, in the absence of EcoRV, namely CRISPR detection, the detection limit was 1000x lower (1%) (Fig. 1h , i; S11).

Briefly, 200 ~ 500 \u03bcl of blood was incubated with red blood cell (RBC) lysis buffer for 1 min, and the cell precipitate was obtained by 1 min of centrifugation. Next, genomic DNA was released by a nucleic acid releaser under 95 \u00b0C for 3 min and then treated by the EasyCatch assay (Fig. S15) . From drawing blood to making treatment decisions, the whole process can be completed within 1 h (Fig. 2a) . We then simultaneously applied EasyCatch and first-generation sequencing (FGS) to detect 32 AML samples whose FLT3 gene mutation status had been analyzed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) previously, wherein P6, P12, P17, P27, and P31 carried drugresistant D835Y/V/H/F mutations ( Fig. 2b; S16, 17) . The results showed that EasyCatch successfully identified all five mutant samples; in contrast, only two samples with relatively high mutation rates, P12 of 17.2% and P31 of 10.9%, were identified by FGS (Fig. 2b) . Thus, Easy-Catch outperforms FGS for clinical sample analysis. More importantly, the EasyCatch method is simple and economical, and only needs a mini centrifuge, a 20 \u03bcl pipette and tips, a heat blocker, and a blue lamp with a 485 nm wavelength (Fig. S18) . We next benchmarked EasyCatch against the commonly used FGS for detecting FLT3-D835 mutations in 80 AML patients (P33 -P112) with unknown FLT3-D835 mutation status, with NGS as the gold standard. Easy-Catch, but not FGS, was able to detect D835Y in P38, P59, P71, P80, P83, and P106 (Fig. 2c) . NGS confirmed that all the six samples harbored the D835Y mutation (at 4.5, 2.7, 4.1, 3.5, 1.2 and 2.4%, respectively) (Fig. S19,  20) . Notably, NGS showed that P86 carried 10.9% nondrug-resistant D835E (GAT>GAA) mutation. As this mutation did not produce a signal in EasyCatch, further confirming the high specificity of this method (Fig. 2c) . The statistical analysis of the 80 cases further showed that EasyCatch is much more sensitive than FGS (100% vs. 0%) (Fig. 2d) .",

EGFR e19del and L858R are the two main mutations sensitive to EGFR-TKIs, thus of great therapeutic value for patients with lung cancer [14] .

We first compared EasyCatch with the CRISPR detection method to detect 1e5 copies of plasmid templates of 1 and 0.1% mutation rate. The results showed that the WT fluorescence signals were strong while the signals of all the four mutations were weak in CRISPR detection. However, the WT signals were almost invisible while the mutation signals were significantly increased in EasyCatch (Fig. 2e; S21a) . The FGS results of the amplified products also confirmed the excellent mutation enrichment effect of EasyCatch (Fig. S21b) . Further analysis indicated that the MT/WT fluorescence ratios in EasyCatch were hundreds of times higher than that of CRISPR detection (Fig. 2f ). More samples with decreasing frequencies (100, 50, 25, 10, 1, 0.1%, and 0) of these mutations were also tested, with consistent results (Fig. S22-25) .",

Total 91,771 human disease-related sites have been documented in the ClinVar database (www. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/ clinv ar), and more than 63,000 restriction enzymes reported in the REBASE database (http:// rebase. neb. com/ rebase/ azlist. re2. html), 485 of them commercially available and functioning at 37 \u00b0C. We of EasyCatch compared with FGS using NGS as a standard reference. e Sensitivity comparison between EasyCatch and CRISPR detection in the detection of IDH2-R172K, EGFR-e19del and L858R, and NRAS-G12D mutations. Genomic locations of these mutations were shown above, wherein exons and mutation sites were colored in blue and red, respectively. The tested samples were 1e5 copies of plasmid templates with a mutation rate of 0.1%. Each amplified product was detected by both WT-crRNA and mutation-crRNA induced Cas12a reaction. Fluorescence intensity and naked eye results were both recorded. f Statistic analysis of the MT/WT fluorescence ratio in EasyCatch and CRISPR detection. The results of 1 and 0.1% mutated samples were counted together. g, h, i The qPCR assay for EGFR-e19del, L858R and NRAS-G12D detection, respectively. The qPCRs were performed on 10, 1 and 0.1% mutated templates. A 100% WT template and ddH 2 O (NC) served as control. j The statistical chart of restriction enzyme cuttable human disease-related genomic sites (mutation < 27 bp, which is the detection length of crRNA), wherein commercial available 37 \u00b0C restriction enzyme cuttable sites can be potentially detected by EasyCatch. The inclusion relation is shown in the upper-right corner found that 53,434 (58.2%) sites can be cut by the 485 enzymes, indicating that the EasyCatch system can potentially diagnose ~ 60% of human disease-related mutations (Fig. 2j) . In addition to restriction enzymes, PAM requirement also imposes restriction on the target range of EasyCatch, but this can be alleviated using Cas12a variants (Table S5) , and primer-introduced PAM (Fig. S29) . Thus, EasyCatch is a versatile method for detecting gene mutations.",
