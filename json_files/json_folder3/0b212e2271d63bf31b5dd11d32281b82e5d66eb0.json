A 382-nucleotide deletion (\u0394382) in the ORF7b and ORF8 regions has been associated with milder disease phenotype and less systemic inflammation in COVID-19 patients. However, its impact on host immunity against SARS-CoV-2 remains undefined. Here, RNAsequencing was performed to elucidate whole blood transcriptomic profiles and identify contrasting immune signatures between patients infected with either wildtype or \u0394382 SARS-CoV-2 variant. Interestingly, the immune landscape of \u0394382 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients featured an increased adaptive immune response, evidenced by enrichment of genes related to T cell functionality, a more robust SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity, as well as a more rapid antibody response. At the molecular level, eukaryotic initiation factor 2 signaling was found to be upregulated in patients bearing \u0394382, and its associated genes were correlated with systemic levels of T cell-associated and pro-inflammatory cytokines. This study provides more in-depth insight into the host-pathogen interactions of ORF8 with great promise as a therapeutic target to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has mutated throughout the pandemic, and multiple variants of concern (VOCs) continue to spread globally. The B.1.1.7 (alpha) VOC has become one of the SARS-CoV-2 strains in the United Kingdom since its emergence in September 2020 due to its increased transmissibility [4] . The P.1 (gamma) and B.1.351 (beta) variants are listed as VOCs as they are associated with enhanced transmissibility and decreased effectiveness of available therapeutics against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [5] . The B.1.617.2 (delta) variant discovered initially in India has become the most dominant strain that largely drives the second or third wave of infections in multiple countries [6, 7] . It is thus important to assess the possible effects of various mutations present in these VOCs on the host immune landscape. Intriguingly, VOCs Alpha, Gamma and Delta variants have a mutation that potentially truncates the ORF8 protein or renders it inactive.",

Several mutations in SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 protein have also been observed in multiple virus strains [13] [14] [15] and these variants account for around 5% of infections worldwide [16] . Although truncated ORF8 variants contribute to milder infections [17] , they were the major variants in Asia and North America during the early pandemic [18] . Understanding the natural biology of host immune response following infection with a SARS-CoV-2 variant that causes a milder disease phenotype will provide important insights into preventive and therapeutic strategies for patient management and improve COVID-19 prognosis. Moreover, the findings could provide clues on the high transmissibility of VOCs that are currently in circulation.",

To decipher the underlying molecular mechanisms of this natural genetic deletion, a comprehensive characterization of the whole blood transcriptomic profiles between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients infected with wildtype (WT) and \u0394382 SARS-CoV-2 was performed in this study. High-density RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed upregulated eIF2 signaling and cellular stress responses, with an under-expression of neutrophil activation-associated signature in \u0394382 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. More robust T and B cell responses were observed, evidenced by enrichment of effector cytotoxic genes and upregulation of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell immunity and antibody responses.",

Briefly, standards and plasma from COVID-19 patients and healthy controls were incubated with fluorescent-coded magnetic beads pre-coated with respective antibodies in a black 96-well clear-bottom plate overnight at 4 \u00b0C. After incubation, plates were washed five times with wash buffer (PBS with 1% BSA (Capricorn Scientific) and 0.01% Tween (Promega)). Sample-antibody-bead complexes were incubated with biotinylated detection antibodies for one hour and washed five times with wash buffer. Subsequently, streptavidin-PE was added and incubated for another 30 min. Plates were washed five times before sample-antibody-bead complexes were re-suspended in sheath fluid for acquisition on the FLEXMAP\u00ae 3D (Luminex) using xPONENT\u00ae 4.0 (Luminex) software. Data analysis was done on Bio-Plex Manager\u2122 6.1.1 (Bio-Rad). Standard curves were generated with a 5-PL (5-parameter logistic) algorithm; reporting mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) and concentration data values. The concentrations were logarithmically transformed to ensure normality. The logarithmically transformed value of Limit of Quantification (LOQ) was assigned to samples with concentrations out of the measurement range.",

IPA analysis revealed IFN signaling, IFN regulatory factor (IRF) activation, pattern recognition receptors (PRR)-induced signaling and salvage pathway of ribonucleotides as the top canonical pathways induced upon SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 1b) .

With the cut-off criteria of p-value < 0.01 and |FC|> 2 [34] , 358 DEGs were identified, in which 259 were over-expressed, and 99 were under-expressed in \u0394382 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients (Supplemental Table 6 ). Principal component analysis (PCA) showed a clear distinction between the two groups of patients, while \u0394382 RNA-seq of whole blood from COVID-19 patients (n = 25) at acute (SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive, median 8 days PIO) and recovered (SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative, median 21 days PIO) phases and healthy controls (n = 6) was performed. a Volcano plot indicating DEGs between blood samples collected at acute and recovered phases in patients with WT SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 13), with thresholds of p-value < 0.01 and |FC|> 2. Numbers of over-expressed and under-expressed genes are indicated. b Top IPA canonical pathways showing differential expression of genes related to IFN and PRR signaling in WT SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pathways are ranked by \u2212 log(p-value), and the color scheme is based on predicted acti-vation Z-scores, with activation in red and undetermined directionality in gray. DEGs related to the IFN pathway are indicated on the bar graph. c Heatmap of DEGs related to IFN and PRR signaling between COVID-19 patients infected with WT (n = 14) and \u0394382 SARS-CoV-2 (n = 11) at acute and recovered phases and healthy controls. Heatmap is scaled based on log 2 RPKM values, with blue and red indicating low and high expressions, respectively. WT, wildtype; DEGs, differentially expressed genes; FC, fold change; FDR, false discovery rate; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PIO, post-illness onset; HC, healthy controls; RPKM, reads per kilobase per million reads mapped; IFN, interferon; PRR, pattern recognition receptor SARS-CoV-2 infected patients overlapped with healthy controls (Fig. 2a) . Notably, gene expression signatures comprising significant DEGs illustrated contrasting whole blood transcriptomic responses between WT and \u0394382 SARS-CoV-2 infections, with the profile of \u0394382 SARS-CoV-2 being closer to that of the healthy uninfected controls (Fig. 2b) . Further analysis of the 358 DEGs revealed eight significant canonical signaling pathways, with the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) signaling pathway being the most significantly enriched in \u0394382 SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 2c) .",

Studies have demonstrated that coronaviruses induce cellular stress responses following infection [42] [43] [44] by targeting unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways to cause an imbalance in cellular homeostasis, which subsequently induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress that favors viral replication [45] . While SARS-CoV ORF8 protein has been previously reported to induce ER stress by specifically targeting activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) [46] , our results suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 protein potentially triggers protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) and eIF2 signaling mechanisms, further strengthening an earlier report showing interactions between SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 protein and human proteins involved in ER quality control [47] . ER stress is known to propagate inflammatory responses [48, 49] , which is consistent with our findings showing reduced systemic inflammation and ER stress levels in \u0394382 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients (Fig. 5) . Notably, there is still controversy amongst the literature about the susceptibility of human PBMCs to SARS-CoV-2 [50, 51] . Although SARS-CoV-2 was detected in immune cells of COVID-19 patients [51] [52] [53] , it remains to be determined whether enhanced activation of the eIF2 pathway in \u0394382 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients is directly caused by a loss of ORF8's impact on ER quality control or due to secondary peripheral immune responses to the mutant virus infection, mediated by soluble factors.",

Cytotoxic effector genes (GZMA, GZMB, ID2, and PLAC8) were enriched in \u0394382 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, coupled with high plasma levels of IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-2 during the acute phase of virus infection. In addition to robust cytotoxic T cell functions, enrichment of KLRB1, GZMA, and GZMK transcripts may indicate enhanced NK cell cytotoxic activity in \u0394382 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, in which the function is impaired in severe COVID-19 patients [54] . Our findings are in agreement with other single-cell studies reporting an enrichment of effector populations with a cytotoxic phenotype (effector CD8 + , MAIT and NK T cells) in COVID-19 individuals with milder disease phenotype [55, 56] and further highlight the impact of SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 on cytotoxic cellular responses in COVID-19 (Fig. 5) . A higher magnitude of virus-specific T cells was induced following \u0394382 infection, and this is in line with other studies in which highly functional virus-specific cellular immune response resulted in better disease outcomes in COVID-19 [57, 58] . It is important to note that genetic variability of the cohort could also explain some of the differences in the T cell response since a few human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, which are predominant in Asia, are associated with COVID-19 severity [59, 60] . Additionally, enhanced effector functions of virus-specific T cells may in turn mediate rapid and protective antibody responses against Fig. 3 Effects of 382-nt deletion in SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 genome on immune responses in COVID-19 patients.

Concordantly, higher IgG responses during the early phase of disease were observed in \u0394382 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, which could indicate a more robust CD4 + T cell response driving B cell activation and maturation in these patients [62, 63] (Fig. 5) . Thus, deletion of ORF8 could result in increased immunogenicity against SARS-CoV-2. Intriguingly, while IgG levels at the later phase of infection have been associated with severe COVID-19 [33, 64] , \u0394382-infected patients with a milder disease phenotype in this report had higher IgG levels at the early acute phase of infection. Our observations are consistent with the findings, which found that S-specific antibody responses were elevated early in COVID-19 individuals who recovered from the disease compared to deceased patients [65] . Further work to fully define the exact roles of IgG in SARS-CoV-2 infection will bring additional insights into this phenomenon.",

The N protein of SARS-CoV-2 was reported to promote inflammation by increasing IL-6 levels following virus infection [68] . Meanwhile, we did not observe any significant difference in the IL-6 levels between the WT and \u0394382 infected patients [17] , suggesting differential roles of ORF8 in inducing hyperinflammation in COVID-19. More interestingly, general pro-inflammatory T h1 responses were more robust in WT infected patients. The non-specific and uncontrolled activation of CD4 + T cells maybe the cause and effect of heightened inflammation observed in WT infection. Lymphopenia and dysregulated myelopoiesis with immature and dysfunctional neutrophils have also been associated with COVID-19 severity [66, [69] [70] [71] [72] . While lymphocyte and neutrophil counts of \u0394382 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients did not significantly differ from WT infected patients [17] (Supplemental Table 1 ), \u0394382 infected patients demonstrated molecular signatures characterized by reduced dysfunctional neutrophils and more robust T cell responses (Fig. 5) .",

            "text": "While mutations on spike protein in SARS-CoV-2 resulted in more efficient virus transmission and severe disease outcomes [76] [77] [78] , the ORF8 deletion does not appear to increase viral load in patients [11] and is associated with milder disease [17] . While in vitro infection of \u0394382 in human nasal epithelial cells induced similar inflammatory signatures [79] , it was not clear how the immune profiles in patients would be affected with the absence of ORF8. Nonetheless, putting all the data together, it is clear that the disease phenotypic difference is likely due to the functional implication of ORF8 on the host immune system. \u0394382 SARS-CoV-2 viruses likely stimulate the activation of common host response signaling mechanisms similar to WT viruses, but with different degrees of magnitude. Our key findings of the functional implication of ORF8 on host immune surveillance further define the relevance of inhibiting ORF8 function as a possible target for therapeutic intervention in COVID-19. Antiviral drugs can be developed against the SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 protein. However, the hypervariable nature of the ORF8 gene and the rapid evolution it undergoes can compromise the suitability of the ORF8 protein as an antiviral target. Alternatively, host-directed strategies [47] can be developed to target the host factors to which ORF8 establishes critical interactions. In this case, a drug that can modulate ER stress responses may benefit the outcome of COVID-19 [80] . Interestingly, the VOCs that have become dominant as the pandemic progresses bear the ORF8 mutation together with multiple spike mutations. The asymptomatic or mild disease phenotype attributed to the absence of ORF8 and the enhanced infectivity caused by the spike mutations may explain the high transmissibility of these Fig. 4 Effects of 382-nt deletion in SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 genome on adaptive immune responses to COVID-19. a SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4 + and CD8 + non-T follicular helper (TFH) cells were characterized with flow cytometry-based on the expression of IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, and TNF-\u237a upon SARS-CoV-2 peptide stimulation in WT (n = 14) or \u0394382 SARS-CoV-2 (n = 14) infected patients.

A SARS-CoV-2 variant with a 382-nucleotide deletion (\u0394382) truncates ORF7b and removes the ORF8 transcription-regulatory sequence, eliminating ORF8 transcription. The ORF8 382-nt deletion has recently been associated with a milder disease phenotype. The attenuation of SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 upregulates eIF2 signaling and cellular stress responses at the acute phase of infection, potentially interrupting the downregulation of MHC-I molecules by ORF8 and also enhances the activation of both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, evidenced by enrichment of effector cytotoxic genes and upregulation of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses in \u0394382 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Enhanced T cell responses may in turn mediate rapid and effective antibody responses in \u0394382 SARS-CoV-2 infection. More pronounced cellular stress responses may further reduce systemic inflammation and dysfunctional neutrophils in \u0394382 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Overall, the attenuation of SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 produced a molecular phenotype characterized by more pronounced cellular stress responses and a less dysregulated immune phenotype with more robust T and B cell responses.
