However, the small number of patients (n=19) who had heterologous booster doses did not permit us to make any firm conclusions (supplementary table   1 ). The question regarding the preferred type of booster dose, viral-vector, inactivated or mRNA vaccine, is currently being addressed in healthy population in many studies. [12] [13] [14] [15] However, there are emerging data to support that heterologous vaccines produce better immune responses than homologous vaccine regimens. 13, 14 In volunteers, booster doses of mRNA vaccine produced better antibody responses, but adenoviral vector vaccine produced better T-cell responses. 15 One study, that compared booster dose (3 rd dose) with inactivated vaccine or mRNA vaccine, showed a higher antibody response in those who received who received booster dose of mRNA vaccine irrespective of the type of initial vaccine. 13 A small study has also shown that antibody responses are better in those who received 2 nd dose of mRNA vaccine among those who received 1 st dose of adeno viral vector vaccine. 16 However, there is a paucity of similar data in immunocompromised, and particularly liver transplant recipients and those with chronic liver diseases, particularly with booster dose with adenoviral vaccine. [17] [18] [19] Despite the absence of any supporting data, it may be reasonable to monitor antibody responses after the booster dose and provide prophylactic neutralizing monoclonal antibody infusions or an additional booster dose in those with suboptimal responses. 20 In countries where only viral vector or inactivated vaccine is available, it will be prudent to give a booster dose with the available vaccine. The CDC or vaccine manufacturers do not recommend giving booster doses based on SAR-CoV-2 spike protein Ab levels, and neither do they make any specific recommendation regarding the type of vaccine for boosting the humoral responses.",
