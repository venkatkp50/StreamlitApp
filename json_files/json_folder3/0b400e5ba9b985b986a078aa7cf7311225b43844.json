Sero positivity was further analyzed according to participants' role in the hospital, nature of exposure, age, gender and history of Covid-19 disease with severity of disease and duration. The differences in SARS CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG levels and sero positivity at T1 (Day-6 to 0) and T2 (14\u00b12) by baseline characteristics has been studied. An analysis of local and systemic solicited adverse events has been undertaken according to their levels and severity. Further detailed analysis of commonly reported SAE's (> 10%) has been undertaken with baseline characteristics. Appropriate tests of significance (Z test, Paired t test and two sample independent t test) have been used to derive the inferences. All analysis was done using SPSS software, version 24.0. p -value < 0.05 has been considered statistically significant. MedDRA (https://www.meddra.org) has been used to code for adverse events. Coding was done with preferred term (PT) and lowest level term (LLT) (10).",

Among those with a past covid history, almost all attained these antibody titres. In comparison to baseline antibody titres, the magnitude of improvement has been of the order of 30 percentage points. The improvement observed was higher among relatively young and clinical HCW. Importantly there has been a mirror change in the values of IgG titre as evidenced from the fact that at the baseline about one-third had the lowest value of 3.8 whereas after 1st vaccination the same percentage had the highest value of more than 400.The common solicited adverse events reported were pain at the injection site, tenderness, fever, headache, muscle pain, fatigue, joint pain, and nausea. These symptoms are reported more by those with a history of covid and by those in the younger age group. The All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",
