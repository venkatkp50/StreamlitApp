Concomitantly, a dramatic increase in screen-detected cervical cancer was observed, and their survival had not been documented. Diagnoses of invasive cervical cancer at ages 20-29 years in 2006-2016 in England were followed until the end of 2018 for deaths. We estimated 8-year overall survival (OS) by International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage and age at first screening invitation. Overall and relative survival for stage IA cervical cancer for women diagnosed aged 20-29 years in England (n = 1905) was excellent at 99.8% (95% confidence intervals (CI): 99.4-99.9%) and 100% (95% CI: 99.7-100.1%), respectively. OS for stage IB cervical cancer (n = 1101) was 90.4% (95% CI: 88.3-92.2%). Survival from stage IB was worse for women diagnosed age 20-24 years compared to those diagnosed 25-29 years at diagnosis (p < 0.0001), but no difference was observed by age at first invitation for screening, p = 0.8575. OS for stage II (65.5%, 95% CI: 60.2-72.0%) and stage III+ (36.6%, 95% CI 28.4-44.7%) were poorer. Survival from stage I cervical cancer in young women in England is excellent: mortality in women with stage IA cancer is akin to that of the general population regardless of age at first invitation to screening.",

Over the last 15 years, the age at which women get their first invitation to attend cervical screening has changed twice: once in 2004, and then again toward the end of 2012. In 2004, the age of first cervical screening invitation in England was increased from 20 to 25.0 years [1] . In 2012, the age of sending out the first screening invitation changed once more: this time to 24.5 years (to enable women to be screened by their 25th birthday) [2] . While rates of cervical cancer in other age groups have remained stable, rates among women aged 25-29 have increased from about 10 to 22 per 100,000 between 2005 and 2015. Mortality from cervical cancer under age 30 has remained stable. Between 2013 and 2016, mortality rates per 100,000 were 0.3 at ages 20-24 years and 1.3 at aged 25-29 years [3] .",

There is no evidence that mortality rates within eight years of stage IA cervical cancer diagnosis was any worse than among all women aged 20-29 years living in England. Although 8-year survival from stage IB cervical cancer in women aged 20 to 29 was 90%, survival was significantly poorer for those diagnosed under age 25 (between 65-75%) compared to those diagnosed at ages 25-29 (around 92%). There was also evidence that survival from IB cervical cancer was better among the screen-detected women. Survival for stage II or worse cervical cancer was poorer. However, since most of these women will be unscreened, one would not expect differences in survival by age of invitation and indeed, there is no difference.",

The results presented here suggest better survival from FIGO IB cervical cancer when it is screen-detected. A difference in survival between screen-detected and symptomatic cancers of all stages has been reported previously [6] . Survival of screen-detected cancers is subject to lead-time bias. Nevertheless, the fact that 8-year survival for stage IB cervical cancer was more than 95% is excellent news for patients and has not, as far as we are aware, been reported before. Survival among the screen-detected stage IB cancer was not substantially greater than survival by age at invitation. It can be argued that stage IB cancers should be homogeneous in their survival since without lead time, they might have been diagnosed at stage IIA. This appears to be true. We did not explore survival by screen-detected status for stage IA or stage II+ cancers because there were only three deaths in 1905 women with stage IA cancer and there were so few screen-detected stage II or worse cervical cancers.",
