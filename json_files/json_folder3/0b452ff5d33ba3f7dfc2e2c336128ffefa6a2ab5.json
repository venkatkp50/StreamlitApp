Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were at one-quarter the odds of stroke compared with other patients (odds ratio, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.16-0.40]). This association was consistent in all age groups. Our results were robust in sensitivity analyses, including propensity score-weighted regression models. In patients presenting with stroke, concurrent infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was associated with higher case-fatality (odds ratio,10.50 [95% CI, 3.54-31.18]) and a trend towards increased occurrence of discharge to rehabilitation (odds ratio, 2.45 [95% CI, 0.81-1.25]). CONCLUSIONS: Using a comprehensive cross-section of patients from a large NY-based healthcare system, we did not identify a positive association between ischemic stroke and COVID-19. However, patients with stroke with COVID-19 had worse outcomes compared with those without, with over a 9-fold increase in mortality. Although no definitive conclusions can be reached from our observational study, our data do not support the concerns for an epidemic of stroke in young adults with COVID-19.",

            "text": "T here has been recent speculation that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with increased risk of fatal ischemic stroke in young adults. [1] [2] [3] Multiple theories have been proposed for the pathophysiology of this association, with a procoagulable state in infected patients as the most commonly proposed mechanism. 1 However, several researchers and clinicians are indicating a decreased occurrence of ischemic stroke across the world during the COVID-19 pandemic. [4] [5] [6] The drop in perceived occurrence has been so dramatic that many societies and advocacy groups have issued statements 6 urging patients to not delay stroke care in fear of being exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing COVID-19. 7 Indeed there has been evidence found for delays in stroke care due to the pandemic. 8 However, no large multi-institutional observational studies support either observation. 9 Despite extensive literature on similar concerns for influenza, 10 is comprised mainly of small, single-institution case series, without control for confounders and limited generalization. The prior report on stroke and COVID-19 in young adults is limited by selection bias, focusing only on the patients with most severe stroke seen by the neurointerventional team. 1 This selection reflects the different preferences and backgrounds of the treating physicians, as well as specific patient characteristics. In addition, although concurrent stroke and SARS-CoV-2 infection have been documented in international series before, [13] [14] [15] the impact of COVID-19 on stroke outcomes has not been studied. There has been no prior report attempting to account for these limitations through different analytic approaches in a cross-section of patients with COVID-19 of all ages. We used a comprehensive cross-section of hospital discharges from a large NY-based healthcare system to study the association of COVID-19 with the occurrence of ischemic stroke. The frequency of unfavorable outcomes in patients with ischemic stroke concurrent SARS-CoV-2 infection was also analyzed. Mixed-effects logistic regression and a propensity score matched logistic regression was used to control for confounding.",

To demonstrate the robustness of our data in sensitivity analysis, we used additional techniques to account for measured confounding while accounting for clustering at the hospital level. These were comprised of inverse-weighted propensity estimation of the absolute difference and odds ratio (OR) and binned propensity scores. Inverse-weighted propensities were trimmed at their 99% percentile.

The propensity scores were derived using a logistic regression of COVID-19 as a function of the covariates mentioned above and all their pairwise interactions. To further test the sensitivity of our results, we repeated the above analyses separately for ischemic stroke (ICD-10 code I63.xx) and transient ischemic attack (ICD-10 code G45.xx). The consistency of our results was also examined by considering acute myocardial infarction (MI), a disease closely correlated with ischemic stroke, as an outcome (ICD-10 code I21.9). Observing a similar trend in cardiovascular disease would validate our analysis. For our secondary outcomes, given the limited df (relatively small number of observations), we used a step-wise logistic regression model controlling for age, sex, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and peripheral vascular disease. In a sensitivity analysis, we repeated the models for our secondary outcomes forcing IV tPA administration and mechanical thrombectomy as covariates in our regression models to account for more severe strokes.

On the contrary, Discharges from the last 10 d of April were excluded from the graph to avoid demonstrating a false drop in cases, given that a significant number of these patients were still inpatients at the time of the study.

This is consistent with anecdotal international reports describing a phenomenon of \"vanishing strokes and heart attacks\" during this period. [4] [5] [6] The decrease was so severe in some countries that multiple public service announcements were released, 6 urging patients to seek immediate care for signs and symptoms of stroke. 7 Most stroke experts attributed this phenomenon to the unwillingness of patients to be exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in an overwhelmed emergency room. 6 Italian researchers 4 have additionally hypothesized a pathophysiologic mechanism behind this decreased stroke occurrence, based on the controversial role of IL (interleukin)-6 in stroke. 19 There is experimental evidence that IL-6, which is elevated in severe COVID-19, has a neuroprotective effect and enhances angiogenesis. 19 Alternate explanations proposed by this group are based on the thrombocytopenia encountered even in patients with mild COVID-19. 20 It is likely that low platelets prevent the formation of large clots in the intracranial circulation. 20 Lastly, the widespread mitigation measures, which have minimized the prevalence of influenza in the community, could have decreased the negative impact of the flu on cardiovascular disease and stroke. 18, 21 Further research into the cause of the observed associations is warranted.",

[13] [14] [15] Although recent investigations have demonstrated that cardiovascular disease is a negative predictive factor of outcomes for COVID-19, 22 the inverse association has not been uncovered before. We identified a higher risk of unfavorable outcomes in patients with ischemic stroke infected with SARS-CoV-2, independent of traditional stroke risk factors and surrogates of stroke severity. We observed a mortality for COVID-19 positive patients with stroke to be 31.8% as compared with 4.6% for COVID-19-negative patients with stroke. We hypothesize this to be due to the respiratory impact of COVID-19 on an already compromised patient with stroke.

Overall, a frequency of 2.9% MI was recorded in patients with COVID-19 and 3.3% among those without SARS-CoV-2 infection. In unadjusted analysis, we identified a trend of decreased frequency of MI (OR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.68-1.12]) on presentation among patients with COVID-19. Likewise, using a logistic regression with facility fixed effects (OR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.69-1.16]), and a propensity-matched logistic regression (OR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.68-1.15]), we identified that SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with decreased, albeit not significantly, the frequency of MI in comparison to noninfected individuals (Table 2).",
