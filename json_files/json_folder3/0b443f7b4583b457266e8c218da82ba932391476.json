            "text": "Background. Deformed wing virus (DWV) is a virulent virus that causes honeybee disease. DWV can exist as a latent infection in honeybees, outbreak into epidemics, and cause serious damage to beekeeping cross the world, including Vietnam. Methods. The two DWV strains circulating in Vietnamese honeybee, Apis cerana, were first isolated from adult honeybees in North Vietnam (DWV-NVN) and South Vietnam (DWV-SVN). Their complete nucleotide sequences were determined, aligned, and compared with other DWV strains. Results. The two Vietnamese DWV strains comprised 10,113 bp and contained a large single open reading frame (ORF) of 2,893 amino acids, initiating at nucleotide 1,130 and terminating at nucleotide 9,812. Multiple nucleotide sequence alignment between these two DWV-VN strains and DWV strains in A. mellifera was performed. The DWV-VN strains showed a low genetic identity (from 91.4% to 92.0%) with almost of these strains, but lower identities (89.2% and 89.4%) with UK2 and (89.6%) with the China2 strain. Low identities (91.7% and 91.9%) were also observed between the China3 strain (in A. cerana) and the DWV-VN strains, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequence alignment showed high genetic similarities (97.0%-97.9%) when the USA1, Chile, and China3 strains were compared to the DWV-VN strains. This ratio was 96.7% and 96.8% when the Korea1 strain was compared to the DWV-SVN and DWV-NVN strains, respectively. Numerous amino acid substitutions were identified in the L, VP3, and RdRp sequences. Notably, we observed six substitutions positioned at amino acids 27 (E > I), 98 (S > T), 120 (A > V), 153 (M > T), 170 (D > F), and 174 (Y > F) in the L protein, two amino acid changes at positions 980 (S > A) and 1032 (E > T) in VP3, and one amino acid change at position 2627 (R > C) unique to the DWV-VN strains. Phylogenetic analysis based on complete genome sequences, RdRp sequences and Simplot analysis indicated that there was a significant difference between DWV-VN strains in A. cerana and DWV How to cite this article Thu HT, Lien NTK, Lanh PT, Duong BTT, Hoa NT, Phuoc MH, Thai PH, Quyen DV. 2020. Genome analysis and phylogenetic characterization of two deformed wing virus strains from Apis cerana in Vietnam. PeerJ 8:e9911 http://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.9911 strains in A. mellifera. The results suggested that the genetic variations of the DWV-VN strains in A. cerana help them to adapt geographical conditions and may lead to change the viral pathogenicity of DWV-VN strains.",

It is found at every stages of development of honeybee (Chen, Higgins & Feldlaufer, 2005; Fievet et al., 2006; De Miranda & Fries, 2008) .

A line of evidence showed that DWV is the cause of colony losses and was most strongly linked to colony collapse (Chen, Higgins & Feldlaufer, 2005; Highfield et al., 2010; Genersch et al., 2010; Pohorecka et al., 2011; Dainat et al., 2012; Martin, Ball & Carreck, 2013) .",

DWV is considered to have a serious impact to morphological transformation from pupae to adult honeybees (Yang & Cox-Foster, 2007) . The DWV infected honeybees have typical symptoms with the wings is deformed, the belly is short, flatulence and paralysis (Bailey & Ball, 1991) , and their lifespan is significantly shortened (Yang & Cox-Foster, 2007) . As a consequence, the number of worker honeybees decreases, leading to colony collapse (Berenyi et al., 2006) .",

DWV has been classified into the Iflavirus genus based on the structure of its genome (Lanzi et al., 2006; Chen et al., in press) . It is a RNA positive-sense with structural proteins at the N-terminal section and nonstructural proteins at the C-terminal section (Lanzi et al., 2006; Ongus et al., 2004) . The N-terminal section consists of a leader polypeptide (L protein) and proteins VP2, VP1, and VP3. The C-terminal section contains of the RNA helicase, the putative VPG (genome-linked viral protein), and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (Lanzi et al., 2006; De Miranda & Genersch, 2010) . However, almost all of the DWV published strains isolated from A. mellifera and DWV genome sequences are highly conserved (Berenyi et al., 2007) . Research on the DWV genome sequence in A. cerana is very limited with only one publication of Fei et al. (2019) . Therefore, understanding the genetic variations of DWV strains in A. cerana will be important to protect honeybees against the disease.",

The nucleotide sequences of both DWV-NVN and DWV-SVN genomes comprised 10,113 bp and contained a large single open reading frame (ORF) coded for 2,893 amino acids, initiating at nucleotide 1130 and terminating at nucleotide 9,812. The genetic identities of these two strains were 98.0% and 99.3% for nucleotide sequences and amino acid sequences, respectively. Multiple nucleotide sequence alignment (Table S1) revealed that DWV-VN showed low genetic identities (91.4%-92.0%) with DWV strains in A. mellifera such as USA1, Chile, Italy1, France, UK1, Korea1, Korea2, Japan, China1 strains and much lower identity (89.2%, 89.4% and 89.6%) compared to UK2 and China2 strain. The genetic identities between DWV-China3 strain in A. cerana and DWV-VN strains were in 91.7% and 91.9%, respectively. When compare the nucleotide sequence at 5 UTR region, they share 93.1%-95.1% identity with those from other countries, and much lower identity (83.1% and 82.8%) compared to the China2 strain. The nucleotide sequence for 3 UTR region showed a high genetic identities (100%) between DWV-NVN strain and DWV-SVN strain. However, the DWV-VN strains shared low genetic identities (90.1%-92.1%) with DWV strains from other countries (including Italy1, UK1, Korea1, Korea2, and China3) and 82.3%-83.3% identity with DWV strains from USA1, Chile, France, UK2, Japan, and China1. Alignment results of amino acid sequences of DWV-VN strains and other DWV strains (Table S1) GT (Lanzi et al., 2006; De Miranda & Genersch, 2010) . In the L protein, DWV-VN strains had six substitutions at amino acids 27 (E > I), 98 (S > T), 120 (A > V), 153 (M > T), 170 (D > F), and 174 (Y > F) in comparison to other strains (Fig. S1A ). In the VP3 region of DWV-VN strains, we also observed two substitutions at amino acids 980 (S > A) and 1032 (E > T) compared to other strains (Fig. S1B ). The alignment of the RdRp sequences pointed out that DWV-VN strains had a substitution at amino acid 2627 R > C, which is different from other strains (Fig. S1C ). In addition, in RdRp of DWV-VN strains we also found one substitution at amino acid 2485 (L > V) that was not found in other investigated strains exept UK1 and UK2 strains. Whereas, the amino acid change at positions 2693 (Y > C) was similar to other strains including France, UK1, UK2, Japan, Korea1, Korea2, China1, China2, and China3 strains compared to USA1, Chile, and Italy1 strains.",

The genome of two DWV-VN strains contained a single large ORF initiating at nucleotide 1,130 and terminating at nucleotide 9,812. The genome of DWV-VN strains was the same with other members in Iflavirus family consisting of structural proteins at the 5 end and the nonstructural proteins at the 3 end arranged in a unique order. Analysis of nucleotide sequences of DWV-VN strains isolated from A. cerana showed the low genetic identities (89.2%-92.0%) when compared to other DWV strains. The low genetic identities were also found in the 5 UTR region between DWV-VN strains and other DWV strains with 82.8%-95.1%. Notably, the 3 UTR region of DWV-VN strains shared 82.3%-92.1% identities with other DWVs, whereas the Korea strains showed a closer relation of 89.7%-94.7% with other strains (Reddy et al., 2013) . These results indicated that there was a significant difference between DWV strains in A. cerana and A. mellifera. The results were remarkable because the 5 UTR and 3 UTR regions play a vital role in translation and stability of the viral mRNA (Song et al., 2006; Kim & Samal, 2010) . It can also explain for the difference in DWV infection percentage between A. cerana and A. mellifera. These ratios may be 8.07% in A. cerana and up to 66.6% in A. mellifera in Korea (Choi et al., 2008; Choe et al., 2012b) . The DWV infection was particularly high, up to over 90% in Europe and USA where A. mellifera is widespread (Tentcheva et al., 2004; Baker & Schroeder, 2008; Welch et al., 2009) .",

In the VP3, the substitutions only occurred at two amino acid sites (Fig. S1B) . Two substitutions in VP3 region were reported by Benreyi et al., (2007) . Interestingly, we observed many amino acid variations in L protein at six different points (Fig. S1A) , and these changes were only found in Vietnamese DWV strains but not in other strains even in China3 strain (a DWV strain in A. cerana honeybees). It has been known that this region was a hotspot for microvariation (Lanzi et al., 2006) . Lanzi et al. (2006) found that the L protein was 5.4-fold variable than the rest of the structural protein and 3.3-fold variable than the nonstructural protein. The L proteins are also different among picornaviruses and are related to pathology through suppression of host cap-dependent mRNA translation (Glaser, Cencic & Skern, 2001) and stimulate the activity of internal ribosome entry site virus (Hinton et al., 2002) . The variations found in the L protein suggested that the DWV-VN strains have changed their pathogenicity, however, further investigations are needed to identify the effects of these changes in translation and virulence of the DWV-VN strains. The RdRp is known to be indispensable for replication of the genome of viruses as well as epigenetic control and post-transcription of cellular gene expression (Ng, Arnold & Cameron, 2008) . It is highly conserved and plays the role in viral evolution (Elena & Sanjuan, 2005) . The increased rates of mutation in this region in the viral population allows the mutation to be selected under the host defence mechanisms and other environmental factors (Crotty, Cameron & Andino, 2001) . In our study, the results of amino acid sequence alignment of this region showed that the DWV-VN strains had three amino acid changes in comparison to other strains. The amino acid change at position 2485 (L> V) was also found in the genome of two DWV strains from UK (Fig. S1C ). And two amino acid changes at position 2627 and 2693 were found on the strains from UK, Japan, Korea, and China in comparison to strains from USA, Chile, Italy and France. However, there were changes at position 2627 (R> C) in DWV-VN and 2627 (R> S) in other strains.",

DWV strains in honeybees A. cerana belonged to the DWV type A group. Otherwise, DWV strains in bees A. mellifera were divided into two subgroups: DWV type B and DWV type C. It has been known that Varroa-DWV interaction has led to the dominance of a particular DWV lineage, supplanting other DWV variation (Ryabov et al., 2014; Wilfert et al., 2016) . This result displayed that there was a significant difference between DWV infected in A. cerana and those infected in A. mellifera. Phylogenetic analysis based on nucleotide sequences of RdRp region showed that the DWV strains isolated from Asian honeybee and the strains isolated from Western and American honeybee were in divided into two separate groups (Fig. S1D) , suggesting that the DWV strains have adapted to the geographical conditions in different regions. Zhang et al. (2012) also provided evidence of the important role of genetic relatedness and the geographical proximity in adaptation of the viruses. Also, the results from the Simplot analysis suggested a significant difference between DWV strains circulating in the Vietnamese honeybee and other A. mellifera (Fig. 2) . This difference was also observed in the China3 strain in A. cerana. Interestingly, the Simplot graph (Fig. 2) revealed that there was high variation between the DWV-VN and other strains, especially in the L,VP1, VP2, VP3, and the polyprotein regions, whereas little variation was observed in the 5 UTR, RdRp, and 3 UTR regions between DWV-VN and other strains.",
