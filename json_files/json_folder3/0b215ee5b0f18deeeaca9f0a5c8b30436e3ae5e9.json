Most recently FAV has been reported to demonstrate activity against SARS-CoV-2. Repurposing opportunities have been intensively studied with only limited success to date. If successful, repurposing will allow interventions to become more rapidly available than development of new chemical entities. Pre-clinical and clinical investigations of FAV require robust, reproducible and sensitive bioanalytical assay. Here, a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry assay is presented which was linear from 0.78-200 ng/mL Accuracy and precision ranged between 89% and 110%, 101% and 106%, respectively. The presented assay here has applications in both pre-clinical and clinical research and may be used to facilitate further investigations into the application of FAV against SARS-CoV-2.",

High intraperitoneal doses (1000 mg/kg) were required in this model but plasma Cmin concentration at this dose were comparable to those seen in humans. Previous work by the investigators indicate that FAV plasma concentrations in humans exceed the SARS-CoV-2 in vitro EC90 (Cmax / EC90 ratio) [12] , but plasma concentrations of FAV diminish with time after multiple dosing [13] and antiviral concentrations identified in Vero E6 cells (EC50 ~62\uf06dM corresponding to an EC90 of ~159\uf06dM; [14] ) are not consistently maintained across the dosing interval. Notwithstanding, recent modelling has hinted that achievable doses should maintain intracellular concentrations of the active metabolite (favipiravir ribofuranosyl-5'-triphosphate) between doses [15] . Assessment of FAV anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in more representative cell lines (e.g. human primary or transformed lung epithelial models) will provide more confidence in the target values.",

Matrix effects may impact various stages of the analytical process, such as ionisation of the analyte (either suppression or enhancement of ionisation) and extraction efficiency [24, 25] . Given the influence of the matrix on the quantification of an analyte, a change in matrix may have detrimental effects on the reliability of an assay. Therefore, the presented method was developed for robust quantification of FAV in multiple matrices. The majority of published methods describe quantification of FAV in a single matrix [26, 27] . The greatest advantage of the assay is robust quantification of FAV in multiple matrices, with minimal impact of matrix effect. The demonstrated versatility will allow assessment of FAV in vitro and in vivo.",
