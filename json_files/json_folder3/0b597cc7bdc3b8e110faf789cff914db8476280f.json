            "text": "Endophytism defines a unique relationship between symbiosis microbes colonized in their plant host without pathogenesis [1] . These symbiotic bacteria and fungi are called endophytes, and they benefit their host in two main aspects: promoting plant growth and protecting the host from invaders [2, 3] . Our study focused on the second aspect in endophyte-assisted plant defense. It is commonly known that endophytic bacteria, like actinobacteria, produce a wide range of anti-infective and cytotoxic agents; one of the most notable examples is maytansine (Figure 1 , left) [3, 4] . It has shown potential antifungal properties [5] and is currently used as an anticancer drug to treat breast cancer [6, 7] . However, our understanding of how endophytes organize maytansine production in plants remains uncertain [8] , and the impacts of endophytic maytansine biosynthesis on secondary plant metabolites are likewise unclear. In this study, we explored these questions further. In 2003, Pullen et al. found an inconsistency in the producibility of maytansine in Gymnosporia and Putterlikia plant species [12] . Moreover, a clone from a maytansine-positive plant lost its ability to produce maytansine after vegetative propagation. None of the maytansine biosynthetic genes were detected from plant materials. The researchers suggested that the endophytes in plants responded to inconsistency in maytansine production [12] . Ten years later, Wing et al. confirmed Pullen's suggestion by reporting the presence of the 16S rDNA of A. pretiosum in P. verrucosa plant materials [13] . A year later, Kusari et al. reported the existence of a maytansine biosynthetic gene (amino-hydroxybenzoic acid, AHBA, synthase) from endophytic bacteria isolated from Putterlikia roots. This evidence led to the conclusion that endophytic bacteria responded to maytansine production in the plants [14] . It is now accepted that endophytes produce maytansine; however, maytansine was absent in pure bacteria culture [10] . This information indicated a consortium-between either plant-endophyte, endophyte-endophyte, or both-that played an essential role in maytansine production in the plant.",

            "text": "In 2016, Kusari et al. presented groundbreaking information indicating that G. serrata (synonym. M. serrata), as a host plant, might produce AHBA as a precursor for the maytansine biosynthesis along with its endophytes [15] . Kusari et al. first reported an endophytic consortium organizing maytansine production inside the plant. In their report, a specific group of endophytes harboring in the bark was the only endophytic community that presented with the halogenase gene, responding to the halogenation step in maytansine biosynthesis (adding a chlorine atom to the maytansine structure). In contrast, other endophytes living in different plant organs carried only the AHBA synthase gene [15] . Unfortunately, they did not report how many endophytes were presented with the halogenase gene found in the bark's endophytic community. Kusari et al. did not investigate the impact of maytansine biosynthesis on Gymnosporia plant secondary metabolite production. It is commonly known that all Gymnosporia plants produce a particular group of metabolites known as quinone-methide pentacyclic triterpenoids (QMTs) [16, 17] , and Maytansine was first accepted as a plant metabolite after its discovery in 1972 from Ethiopian Celastraceae plants, namely Gymnosporia serrata (synonym Maytenus serrata) and G. ovata (synonym M. ovata) [9] . Interestingly, nearly thirty maytansine derivatives were later isolated from other plants; for example, Putterlickia verrucosa (Celastraceae), Colubrina texensis (Rhamnaceae) and Trevia nudiflora (Euphorbiaceae) [10] . In 1977, the first bacterial maytansine analog, ansamitocins, was reported from Actinosynnema pretiosum [11] . This discovery posed the question: was maytansine a plant or a microbial metabolite?",

In detail, we first selected G. heterophylla as our model and used PCR-based genome mining as a tool to explore a diversity of maytansine-producible endophytic communities in G. heterophylla. We confirmed the producibility of maytansine from the detected endophytes using the gene expression approach. Second, we evaluated the impacts of maytansine biosynthesis on Gymnosporia plant secondary metabolite production, focusing on QMT metabolites produced by G. heterophylla. In addition, we found from our previous report that G. heterophylla could produce 20hydroxymaytenin ( Figure 1 , right), a QMT [21] . Therefore, we selected the friedelin synthase (FRS) gene from 20-hydroxymaytenin biosynthesis as a plant metabolite gene and compared it with the endophytic maytansine biosynthetic genes. As a result, we found a specific group of endophytic bacteria responsible for producing AHBA, a precursor of maytansine. In addition, for the first time, we identified six clusters of the halogenase gene from endophytic communities, harboring specifically in the roots of G. heterophylla. In total, there were seven endophytes involved in maytansine production. Furthermore, our gene expression experiment suggested a stress trigger to activate maytansine biosynthesis from the endophytic communities.

In this experiment, all obtained halogenase genes were deposited in the NCBI database (NCBI accession numbers: OK649330 to OK649336, OK754597 to OK754600, and OL944594), and the phylogenic tree was deposited on the TreeBASE database under TreeBASE ID: Tr134221 (http://purl.org/phylo/treebase/phylows/study/TB2:S28886, accessed on 9 October 2021). We provided all the details of the obtained halogenase gene sequences used to perform phylogenetic analysis in the supplementary file (Table S2 ).",

Our result thus opposed previous reports showing that the upregulation of the AHBA synthase gene increased the production of the maytansine derivative ansamitocin P3, [30, 31] . In Li's study, the asm18 gene, encoding a regulatory protein, was overexpressed in A. pretiosum, resulting in a selective upregulation of the AHBA synthase gene and leading to enhanced ansamitocin P3 production [31] . Moreover, Gao's study used a combination of glucose and glycerol as a carbon source, mixing in a cultivation medium of A. pretiosum culture to increase the production of ansamitocin P3 by elevating AHBA synthase gene expression. Both Li's and Gao's results were from a straightforward system and single strain cultivation. Our results came from endophytic communities harbored inside a plant, a much more complex system. Therefore, circumstantial differences between previous studies and our study might explain the altered AHBA synthase gene expression. In addition, the higher expression levels of the AHBA synthase when the halogenase gene did not express might suggest another ecological function of AHBA in a plant, i.e., more than just as a precursor for maytansine production.",

To test our hypothesis, we evaluated the production of 20-hydroxymaytenin using the same gene expression experiment, since we found, in our previous work, that 20-hydroxymaytenin was linked with antifungal activity and related to plant defense [21] . We selected the FRS gene from the 20-hydroxymaytenin biosynthesis as a marker. Later, we found that the expression of the FRS gene was upregulated in the roots of the 2018 G. heterophylla, the same sample capable of producing maytansine by endophytic communities. Based on the best authors' knowledge, we were the first to observe and report this relationship between the endophytic maytansine and the plant 20-hydroxymaytenin biosyntheses. Previously, Pavarini and colleagues showed that both biotic and abiotic stimuli affected the production of maytenin (a parent structure of 20-hydroxymaytenin) in the Gymnosperia plant. However, biotic stimuli demonstrated better impact than abiotic stimuli [31] . This was supported by the latest study from In\u00e1cio in 2019, reporting that a co-cultivation between G. ilicifolia and Bacillus megaterium increased maytenin production by 24 times over the control without B. megaterium [32] . Combining all data from recent works in the literature [31, 32] , our previous study [21] , and the current study, we proposed a possible mechanistic response of endophytic communities and G. heterophylla to the stress triggers activating maytansine production and upregulating 20-hydroxymaytenin biosynthesis simultaneously (Figure 9 ). In Eckelmann's study, the researchers proposed something similar, stating that it could be an endophytic-associated trigger activating maytansine biosynthesis during and after the propagation processes to protect the seeds and young plants-thus providing a greater chance of survival against natural pathogens or herbivores [27] .",

We used the young branch of a stem from the 2018 G. heterophylla presented with the AHBA synthase gene-positive for a vegetative propagation by a cutting technique. After six months of cultivation (Figure 8) , the vegetatively cloned G. heterophylla was terminated, and the presence of the AHBA synthase gene was evaluated. AHBA synthase was detected in the roots of the cloned plant, but not in the stem as in the original plant. This indicated that endophytic bacteria carrying the AHBA synthase gene moved from the branch to the roots after regeneration. Pereira et al. reported that roots cultivated in a greenhouse with high sugars and amino acid contents were more attractive to endophytes because they need a carbon source and amino acids to grow [33] . Vranova and her colleagues reported that young roots produced more sugars and amino acid concentrations than old ones [34] . This could explain the relocation of the AHBA synthase gene-positive endophytes to the newly generated cloned's roots. We did not find that the AHBA synthase gene was expressed in the cloned G. heterophylla. It seems that the cloned plant was cultivated in a safer environment (i.e., the laboratory) than the natural habitat of the original plant (South Africa). The AHBA synthase gene was expressed from G. heterophylla cultivated in our laboratory (GM-Lab) in the same conditions as the cloned plant, as depicted in Figure 5 . It is worth noting that the cloned plant was cultivated using the hydroponic method, i.e., non-soil cultivation, while G. heterophylla from our laboratory (GM-Lab) was grown in a regular potting soil mix. Since hydroponic cultivation faces less abiotic and biotic stresses than soil-based cultivation [35, 36] , the difference between these methods may impact the expression of the AHBA synthase gene between the cloned and G. heterophylla from our laboratory (GM-Lab). report from Forte et al. showed that a pattern of endophytes was changed over the propagation from one generation to another generation. Forte suggested that endophytes adapted to the plant's metabolites and defense mechanisms over generation [40] . We found that the occurrence of the halogenase gene in the cloned G. heterophylla plant came from the alteration of the endophytic population, as reported by Saleh, Xiong, and Forte [38, 40] . Our study thus presented a new piece of evidence showing that maytansine-producible endophytes can transmit from a mother plant to a cloned plant via vegetative propagation. The halogenase gene was detected from the roots of the cloned plant when the same halogenase gene was absent in the mother plant. There are two possible explanations for this The first is the cloned plants uptaking the halogenase gene-positive bacteria from the surrounding environment, e.g., soil, a rich source of bacteria [37] . We reject this hypothesis because our cloned plant was cultivated using clay pebbles (synthetic non-soil materials) under laboratory conditions. Second, there could have been a change in the endophytic population inside the cloned plant roots. A recent report from Saleh's study supported this explanation, reporting that the roots of Brachypodium distachyon produced and secreted particular organic acids favoring a specific endophytic bacteria strain over the others [38] . By quorum sensing, like autoinducer-2, the endophyte could be positively stimulated to colonize in plant tissue like roots, as reported by Xiong et al. [39] . Another recent report from Forte et al. showed that a pattern of endophytes was changed over the propagation from one generation to another generation. Forte suggested that endophytes adapted to the plant's metabolites and defense mechanisms over generation [40] . We found that the occurrence of the halogenase gene in the cloned G. heterophylla plant came from the alteration of the endophytic population, as reported by Saleh, Xiong, and Forte [38, 40] .

In previous studies from Kusari et al., these primers were able to successfully amplify the AHBA synthase gene from plant materials [14, 15] . Therefore, we decided to follow Huit et al. and Kusari et al. [14, 15, 22] . The used primer pair was defined as a forward primer (AHBA-F: AGAGGATCCTTCGAGCRSGAGTTCGC) and a reverse primer (AHBA-R: GCAGGATCCGGAMCATSGCCATGTAG) [14, 15, 22] . The Red Taq polymerase Master Mix (1.1x) from VWR Life Science (Denmark) was used to amplify the desired PCR product. We prepared a total of 50 \u00b5L of a PCR reaction mixture, strictly following the manufacturer's guidelines. The PCR reaction solution used consisted of 0.5 \u00b5L of 100 \u00b5M of each primer, 2 \u00b5L of the plant's total genomic DNA (50 to 160 ng/\u00b5L), 2 \u00b5L of the sterilized water, and 45 \u00b5L of the polymerase master mix. The concentration of total genomic DNA was in the recommended range of the Red Taq polymerase from the company (in a range of 50 to 500 ng in total). The PCR cycling consisted of an initial denaturation at 95 \u2022 C for 120 s, 35 cycles of denaturation at 95 \u2022 C for 30 s, annealing at 69 \u2022 C for 40 s, and elongation at 72 \u2022 C for 60 s. Lastly, the final elongation was done at 72 \u2022 C for 5 min. For reference, A. mirum strain DSM-43827 was used. The amplified PCR product, spanning around 755 bp, was checked by agarose electrophoresis. In the end, the PCR product was purified using Macherey Nagel Gel and PCR Clean-up (D\u00fcren, Germany) and sequenced by Microsynth/Seqlab (Goettingen, Germany). Finally, the obtained sequences were blasted against the NCBI database (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi, accessed on 1 October 2021).",

We found that the AHBA synthase gene presented in the G. heterophylla plant materials was from endophytic bacteria living inside the plant, not from the plant itself. We also identified six different clusters of the halogenase gene from endophytic bacterial communities in the roots of G. heterophylla collected from South Africa in 2017 and 2018. Our data showed a unique halogenase gene cluster presenting in only a specific collection (either the 2017 or 2018 collection), indicating a dynamic change of endophytic bacterial communities over the year. Notably, only G. heterophylla collected from South Africa in 2018 expressed both the AHBA synthase and halogenase genes, showing that maytansine could be produced. This information suggested that it might have been a specific trigger present in 2018 that activated maytansine biosynthesis which did not present in the 2017 collection. It is worth noting that 20-hydroxymaytenin biosynthesis (FRS gene) was also upregulated in G. heterophylla from the 2018 collection. This finding implied that the similar trigger activating maytansine biosynthesis also upregulated the plant's FRS gene expression. To the authors' best knowledge, this study marked the first time six different halogenase genes was reported from G. heterophylla, and that the correlation between maytansine and 20-hydroxymaytenin biosyntheses from endophytic communities and G. heterophylla, a plant host, was observed.",
