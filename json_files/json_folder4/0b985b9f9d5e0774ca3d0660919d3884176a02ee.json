Four constructs related to employee well-being, including engagement and job satisfaction, and five constructs related to job strain, including exhaustion and concerns, were identified. A distinction was made between job demands and resources that were a pure characteristic of VBHC, and job demands and resources that resulted from environmental factors such as how care organizations shaped VBHC.",

This aligns to the quadruple aim of (1) improving health outcomes for patients, (2) enhancing patient experience, (3) enhancing healthcare professional experience, and (4) reducing cost (5) . In comparison to traditional care practices, VBHC may change professionals' work by introducing new, or shifting emphasis toward, valuepromoting care activities and team-based care (6) . Such activities include discussing value with patients, making a shared decision, learning, and improving based on quality and performance indicators and providing care in pathways (7) (8) (9) . Although these activities may not all be completely new (10) , the difference is that each activity is now used as a means to generate value rather than being an end-goal in itself. VBHC is different from current care and requires new competencies of professionals (11) . Psychosocial factors at work describe how work factors, such as the work environment and job content, interact with personal factors, such as a person's competence and expectations, to impact employee experience and well-being (12, 13) . Hence, we may expect changes in professionals' well-being with VBHC currently gaining traction.",

Most studies on VBHC understandably focus on patients and clinical results (14) (15) (16) and build on insights from implementation science [e.g., (17) (18) (19) ]. Earlier reviews focusing on healthcare professionals and VBHC studied education (20) and interventions to reduce low-value behavior (21) . Current literature suggests that VBHC meets the interest of professionals i.e., to deliver value for patients (1) and positively contributes to their work experience (22). However, the relation between VBHC and professionals' interests nor the contribution of VBHC to their work experience has been convincingly established. Current literature hints at a relation between VBHC and various job demands and resources including work pressure, emotional demands, and autonomy (23) . The literature further suggests both positive and negative relations between VBHC and professionals' well-being, such as improved engagement (24) and potential fears concerning among others accountability and value-based competition on results (1) .",

Since JD-R allows flexible use and tailoring to fit specific contexts (29), we iteratively adapted the JD-R model by including all abstracted data regarding the relation between VBHC and the professional.

Figure 3 shows that VBHC was associated with specific job demands and resources. Besides providing an overview of these factors, we distinguished between two types of job demands and resources. Namely, job demands and resources that were purely informed by the characteristics of the job, in this case pursuing VBHC, and job demands and resources that stemmed from characteristics of the environment. These characteristics of the environment included among others organizational structures, culture, and resources, as well as how actors, such as healthcare organizations and policy makers, facilitated, and shaped the job. For example, when a professional experienced that VBHC took more effort than traditional care, this was considered a demand that resulted from the nature of VBHC. When a professional felt pressured by the pace of implementation, this was considered a demand triggered by a characteristic of the environment. Connecting lines in Figure 3 were based on the studies included in the review and hence differ from the original JD-R model. Except for an arrow describing the moderating effect that job demands may have on the relationship between job resources and employee well-being, arrows in the model were omitted to reflect possible bidirectionality.

First, studied employer characteristics included hospital type, region, health-care intensity, and number of clinicians. These factors were related to, among others, self-reported knowledge, perceived barriers, behaviors, and performance in VBHC (23, 48, 55, 63, 64, 69, 70, 74, 75, 77) . Concerning culture, participants called for culture change (24, 31, 47, 56) and mentioned the need for specific cultures, particularly cultures that are transparent and blame-free (14, 31, 48, 53, 56, 66, 69, 72) . Related to HR and capacity, studies discussed staffing constraints (33, 49, 59, 61) , the importance of staff stability (24, 59, 66) , staff composition including the use of alternative providers and medical assistants [e.g., (14, 24, 33, 35, 60, 64-66, 71, 72, 76) ] and specific open job positions (33, 34, 62, 72, 78) . Remarks made about organizational facilities and approaches involved professionals' desire for dedicated VBHC time (14, 59, 66) , stepby-step implementation (34, 35, 56, 72, 76) , and an overall supportive environment (24, 31, 53, 54, 56, 57, 59, 62, 65, 66, 72, 73) with specific attention for engaged leadership (14, 33, 35, 54, 66) . Analysis revealed several meso-and macro-level impediments to VBHC (24, 35, 49, 54, 76) such as current waitlists to access specialists. Last, related to the time era, one study reported on the expected progressive impact of Covid-19 on VBHC (72) .",

VBHC can be considered a job resource as healthcare professionals mentioned that VBHC aligned with their interest, ethics, and nature of their work and reconnected them with their true role (24, 31, 35, 54, 55, 66, 72) . Within VBHC, teams and workflows were reconfigured to allow everyone to utilize their competences to the full extent. However, when the reconfiguration was inadequate, professionals were concerned to become IT-specialists and were hindered to use their competences optimally (66) . Consequently, professionals experienced job demands when their work environment did not support them to practice their role (33, 38, 55) . VBHC itself also introduced role strain (14, 24, 32, 34, 51, 55, 60, 69, 74) . For example, professionals found it hard to balance patient care and implementation work (33) , questioned their role in discussing costs with patients (69) , and experienced role unclarity due to new responsibilities in VBHC that were not yet formalized (14, 32) . Residents in particular experienced specific strains related to priority-setting between VBHC and learning goals and felt uncertain about their contribution to VBHC (51, 55, 60, 74) .",

On the other hand, professionals seemingly faced more challenges in value-based patient contact (49-51, 55, 57, 69, 73-75) . Professionals reported difficulties, reluctance and discomfort when discussing VBHC with patients, specifically costs (48, 55, 57, 69) , and the choice of non-treatment (50) . Professionals also mentioned to face demanding patients and patients with wrong expectations, which hindered or even prevented them to provide VBHC (49, 51, 55, 75) .

Professionals report on increased meaning in their work and improved patient contact, teamwork, and communication. However, implementation of VBHC also takes energy from professionals. Although some studies report on reduced administrative workload in VBHC, other studies suggest that VBHC increases workload. This difference, as well as how other work factors are evaluated, may be partly explained by variety in professionals' work environments such as the level of organizational support, as elaborated below. Other job demands professionals may experience are role strain, teething problems with the transformation to VBHC and overall challenges evoked by change. Furthermore, within their organization, professionals seem to experience paucity of adequate IT resources, authority to implement VBHC and time to become acquainted with VBHC. Professionals also report on difficulties in discussing costs with patients. The latter is striking as we do not find literature that advises professionals to discuss costs with patients as part of VBHC besides themselves taking accountability for adequate use of resources. Hence, this disparity may suggest that the job demand that relates to discussing costs with patients is redundant.",

This may imply that VBHC involves various established psychosocial factors at work and not so much radically introduces new factors that seek our attention. However, the results from this review may be too rosy as VBHC projects to date possibly focused on low-hanging fruits. Moreover, the identified factors may apply to specific VBHC components and be partly environment specific. This implies that the results from this review are not expected to apply to all professionals and hence should be interpreted with care.",

For example, professionals who experience that VBHC takes more effort is considered a demand that stems from VBHC. Professionals who feel pressure from the pace of implementation is considered a demand that stems from the work environment, as it depends on how organizations shape and facilitate VBHC. This distinction is in line with the concept of psychosocial factors at work, which explicitly distinguishes between job content, work environment, and organizational conditions as factors that impact employee well-being (13) .",

            "text": "Strikingly, this review finds that several job demands stem from organizations' inadequate management of VBHC, i.e., speeded VBHC implementation, suboptimal workforce composition connected to care pathways and insufficient organizational resources and capacity. This observation underlines the need for organizations to better support their employees by providing the necessary resources and designing appropriate organizational structures and interventions to Being energized (24, 66) \"I think even greater sense of meaning that we're all working towards the greater good of patient health and well-being, and I think that genuinely energized people\" (66) Having joy in practice (66) \"All but one of the practices indicated that their transformation efforts led to increased joy of practice\" (66) Joy in practice being moderated by demands (66) \"The one outlier practice indicated increased sense of purpose and mission and did not indicate decrease in joy or well-being, but did acknowledge that increased work necessary for practice transformation moderated increased joy of practice\" (66) Increased Job Satisfaction (24, 32, 44, 60, 66) \"All participants in the structured interviews noted improved job satisfaction after the transition period, given the new sense of employee engagement and accountability\" (44) Job strain Studies Exemplifying quote Exhaustion and energy drain (24, 32, 33) \"This was experienced as a long and energy-draining process\" (32) Negative emotions (24, 33, 47, 55, 73) \"Participants expressed both their colleagues and their nonadherence to CPW [clinical pathways] can result in a range of emotions from fear to frustration\" (73) Losing focus and getting stuck (24, 33) \"In all, these residents sometimes let time pressure, demanding patients, concerns over supervisors potentially overruling them, their wish to develop or maintain a patient-resident relationship, and fears of claims make them lose their focus on HV3C delivery\" (55) Concerns (24, 31, 32, 48, 50, 51, 53, 55, 56, 69, (73) (74) (75) (76) \"Nearly 50% reported that the clinicians' fear of legal repercussions affects their frequency of ordering unneeded tests or procedures, and 30% reported that individual clinicians are blamed for complications\" (69) Burnout (38) \"Those who felt burned out at the completion of training (\u03b2 =-0.52, 95% CI \u22121.00-0.04, p=0.03) were more likely to score lower on the [Residency High Value Care] scale\" (38) mitigate or avoid job demands and enhance job resources. Subsequently, this may sustainably improve professionals' contributions to VBHC via improved employee well-being. This is especially relevant in the light of research relating employee experience and well-being to organizational performance measures (83, 84) such as workforce engagement in healthcare development (85) . In other words, just personal engagement of professionals is insufficient as is illustrated by the following quote: \"[They] recognize that HV3C [high-value, cost-conscious care] practices depend in part on the patient population, available resources, and organizational structure [. . . ] Although they initially aimed to provide HV3C, under external pressure their pro-HV3C aspirations waned\" (55) . The view that VBHC is a shared responsibility and requires multi-level support is supported by the adapted JOINT model (42). This model defines five layers, being the (1) individual layer, (2) interpersonal layer, (3) job level layer, (4) organizational layer, and (5) national layer. Each of these layers has been suggested to impact nurse absenteeism and turnover (42). Not only can multi-layered support help us reduce negative psychosocial work factors in VBHC and hence prevent disease and dysfunction in the workforce, but also can this layered support contribute positive psychosocial work factors in VBHC and hence support professionals to flourish. On the organizational level, support may be best shown to advantage as part of a \"top-guided bottom-up\" approach. In a top-guided bottom-up approach efforts of professionals, primarily teams, are orchestrated centrally (86) . Within this approach organizations provide their employees supportive infrastructure, tools and resources including protected time, relevant data, staff training, and administrative and analytic support.",

            "text": "This study has five biases. First, the identified outcomes of VBHC on professionals' experiences and their well-being may not be generalizable to all professionals working in a VBHC context for three reasons. Namely, scholars may use different criteria for judging whether their intervention is part of VBHC, studies report on different combinations of VBHC activities and -as this review concludes -experiences may be partly work environment specific. A second bias is that studies reporting on high-value care and high-value, cost-conscious care are generalized while there may be subtle differences between these care models. Hence, we may expect professionals to pursue slightly different behaviors in each of these care models, which, in turn, may evoke slightly different experiences and outcomes. Third, this review does not distinguish between the type of healthcare professional and her educational status. Clinicians, nurses, and residents, who form the main populations in the included studies, may fulfill different roles in VBHC and hence can be expected to have different experiences and encounter different personal outcomes. Consequently, based on this review, it is not possible to target focused interventions to specific populations. Fourth, the temporality of the findings is uncertain as some experiences and outcomes may be connected to implementation efforts more than being a lasting characteristic of VBHC. However, judging whether VBHC has become part of the normal work is complicated as this perception is suggested to vary from professional to professional (24) . Last, assessing whether a job demand or resource is a characteristic of VBHC or a characteristic of the environment is a delicate task and requires certain interpretability as all care activities take place in an environment. This implies that different takes on the resulting overview of job demands and resources are possible.",

Providing adequate guidance is especially relevant as professionals play a prominent role in VBHC (1), which aligns with our findings. Moreover, value-enhancing behaviors of professionals, such as shared decision making, increasingly become legal requirements (87, 88) . The 10 behaviors this review describes (see Figure 4 ) may serve as a base for this guidance. While some of these behaviors correspond to Porter's value agenda (89) , this review also proposes new behaviors. In line with an earlier proposed extension to Porter's value agenda (7) , this review suggests to incorporate behaviors to \"learn and improve care\" and to \"discuss value in the clinical encounter\" as additional elements. Furthermore, this review focusses attention to the need for professionals to \"adopt appropriate mindsets for VBHC, \" in particular by truly focusing on what matters to patients. Other behaviors this review contributes are to \"work in teams and collaborate, \" \"involve patient representatives, \" \"take accountability for patients and resources, \" \"practice bottom-up engagement, \" and \"participate in population health and prevention.\"",

Caring for employees is besides being morally integer and beneficial for organizational performance also a legal obligation in Europe (91) . In addition to mitigating and avoiding adverse effects of VBHC on the professional, organizations may seek to exploit VBHC to contribute to positive psychosocial factors at work.

Within this approach, attention should be given to the pre-implementation and delivery phase of VBHC to prevent professionals from having avoidable adverse experiences. The International Labour Organisation (13) studied frequent omissions and mistakes when implementing changes at the workplace. From this research we derive that technical and psychological preparation is needed prior to implementation. For VBHC this implies that, among others, PROM technologies and care pathways should be adequately established and professionals need to be sufficiently informed and trained. Second, during VBHC delivery, professionals should be offered support depending on their personal needs. Next to the use of PROMs and PREMs, we see opportunity to periodically evaluate psychosocial factors at work and use these results for improvements. Third, organizational should give explicit attention to implementing VBHC at a satisfying pace in the eyes of professionals since professionals reported to feel pressured. Furthermore, organizations need to ensure that professionals have necessary authority to implement and deliver VBHC as professional mentioned lack of authority as impediment to VBHC. Last, by preventing staff shortages, providing professionals dedicated time for VBHC and optimizing team composition, organizations can mitigate or avoid increases in professionals' workload and even exploit VBHC to reduce administrative workload and optimize job resources such as meaning in work, comfort and collaboration.",

Antecedents identified in prior research on psychosocial factors at work may provide inspiration (13) . Second, this work contributes to VBHC literature by shifting attention toward the professional.

First, application of existing theories and frameworks is recommended as only one of the studies included in this review did so. Second, this review provides an overview of factors that impact the professional and her delivery of VBHC both positively and negatively. Future work may investigate sufficient and necessary conditions to make VBHC work such as strong leadership, a culture of continuous improvement and strengthened team-based care. Third, future work may focus on personal resources in VBHC as these seem understudied. Personal resources, such as optimism and self-efficacy, may affect a person's functioning and are hence integrated in the JD-R model (92) . Another opportunity for future work focuses on pre-existing care practices that gained a new life in VBHC, such as efforts to improve care and working with PROMs. This review builds on the assumption that these care practices are experienced differently now they are applied as mechanisms to optimize value in care as opposed to satisfying different purposes or being an end-goal in themselves. However, future research is necessary to validate this assumption. Finally, due to the multifaceted nature of VBHC, scholars may attempt to study how, and to what degree, each component of VBHC, as well as possible interactions between components, impacts job experience and employee well-being. Impact evaluations of VBHC implementation programs across different hospitals would allow to generate such insights among healthcare professionals. The ongoing transformation from traditional healthcare delivery to VBHC provides momentum for evaluation of the effectiveness of VBHC in relation to job experience and employee well-being by comparing traditional care practices to value-based care practices.",
