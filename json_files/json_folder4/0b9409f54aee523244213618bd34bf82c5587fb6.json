            "text": "O cclusion of the endotracheal tube (ETT) by debris and organized secretions may occur while providing mechanical ventilation (MV) for critically ill patients. Narrowing of ETT is probably a common occurrence. [1, 2] Studies that evaluated ETTs using acoustic reflectometry showed that their intraluminal volume got smaller after intubation. [3, 4] The ETTs from 101 patients who required MV for >24 h were evaluated after extubation. [3] They had smaller volumes than unused ETTs (average difference in ETT segment volumes was 9.8%; range, 0%-45.5%). [3] Another similar study found a volume reduction above 10% in 60.8% of ETTs with the mean difference in ETT segment volumes of 15.2% (range, 0%-66%). [4] Clinically significant ETT occlusion is probably less common. [1, 2] The risk factors for ETT occlusion include thick or bloody respiratory secretions, mucosal sluffing, [5] bacterial colonization of the ETT with biofilm formation, [6] and possibly the duration of intubation. [3, 4, 7] ETT occlusion has been associated with the humidification of inhaled gases during MV, but this association has not been consistent. In several observational studies, the use of heat moisture exchanger (HME) has been found to be associated with higher rates of ETT occlusion compared with active humidification. [2, 8] However, other studies found no association between inhaled gas humidification method and ETT occlusion. [7] A systematic review of 18 randomized controlled trials (2442 adult intensive care unit [ICU] patients) found that the incidence of artificial airway occlusion was not different in patients treated with HMEs versus heated humidifiers (HHs) (relative risk, 1.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79-4.34). [9] ETT occlusion in the ICU setting can be life-threatening and can result in increased morbidity, including pneumonia and pulmonary edema. [10] Its early recognition and prevention are important goals. As the literature on ETT occlusion in the ICU setting is scarce, we described the results of a quality improvement project that aimed at preventing ETT occlusion in critically ill patients and evaluated the impact of ETT occlusion on the outcomes of patients.",

During this study period, ETTs that had subglottic secretion drainage were used for intubation. The routine care for mechanically ventilated patients included endotracheal suctioning of respiratory secretions four hourly and as needed using a closed suctioning system, which was changed every 72 h or as clinically indicated. Saline instillation during suctioning was not routinely performed but was used in case of thick secretions on as needed basis. Open suctioning was performed if closed suctioning was not effective. Ventilator circuits were changed in between patients or if they became soiled or damaged. For years before the improvement project, humidification of inhaled gases was routinely done using HMEs (Pall Ultipor \u00ae 25 filter) which were changed daily or when visibly soiled. HHs were available but there were no clear guidelines on the indications of their use in the departmental policy. In our ICUs, the adequacy of gas humidification, by directly measuring humidity or by evaluating its surrogate markers (i.e., secretion characteristics and visual observation of condensate in the tubings), [2] was not monitored during the routine bedside care.",

The root cause was determined to be the overuse of passive humidification of inhaled gases using HME. Then, the humidification policy for patients on MV was updated according to the 2012 clinical practice guideline of the American Association for Respiratory Care. [12] The guideline recommended that all patients with an artificial airway requiring MV should receive continuous humidification of inspired gases and suggested that during invasive MV active humidification should provide a humidity level between 33 and 44 mg H 2 O/L and gas temperature between 34\u00b0C and 41\u00b0C at the circuit Y-piece with a relative humidity of 100% and that HMEs should provide a minimum of 30 mg H 2 O/L. Table 1 describes the humidification guidelines that we implemented in our ICUs. The results of the root cause analysis and the policy changes were presented to the ICU staff. Moreover, the number of HHs (Fisher and Paykel Healthcare humidifiers) was increased after securing a budget from the hospital administration. Using a standardized form, we then audited all ETT occlusion cases that required changing the ETT and that occurred after the initial cluster till September 30, 2018. Auditing of humidification practices and active feedback were periodically performed afterwards.",

            "text": "In extreme cases, it may be a medical emergency and may lead to cardiac arrest. We observed that the ETT occlusion incidents were unsuspected and required urgent ETT change (38.9% of cases in the afterhours). The peak airway pressure was not always very high. In this study, the median peak pressure was 26 cm H 2 O and went down by 6 cm H 2 O after ETT change. In another study, improvement in peak airway pressure with ETT exchange occurred in 78.9% of patients with a median change of 12 cm H 2 O (interquartile range 2-17.5). [5] The study also found improvement in arterial blood gases after ETT change. [5] The pattern of expiratory flow may indicate ETT occlusion early, whereas increased peak pressure is usually a late event. [15] This study was triggered by a cluster of clinically significant ETT occlusion incidents occurring within 10 weeks where all patients were on HME for inhaled gas humidification. Our root cause analysis suggested that HME may be responsible for these incidents. Knowing that different brands provide different levels of moisture, HMEs may not provide adequate humidification. This may be exacerbated by longer HME use and higher tidal volumes. Hence, a cascade of events occurs that include thickening of mucus, damage of mucosa, and desquamation of epithelial cells. [16] This material may adhere to the inside of ETT and gradually occludes the tube. The literature on the association between inhaled gas humidification and ETT shows mixed findings, and it is limited by the study sample sizes and the differences in methods. In 170 ICU patients on HME, ETT occlusion, defined as an inability to ventilate the patient, which resolved after emergency ETT change, occurred in 15 (8.8%) patients over 8 months. [1] When cascade humidification was used instead of HME for 81 patients, only one (1.2%) ETT occlusion occurred over 4 months (P < 0.01). [1] A prospective observational study of patients who required intubation found that the incidence of ETT occlusion was 5.7% in the HME group and 0% in the HH group. [13] Another study also found that ETT resistance increased significantly more with HME than with HH in patients who required MV for >48 h. [8] However, such findings were not seen in other studies. A prospective cohort study in an ICU that had 22 patients on HH and 22 on HME found that the ETT resistance increased by an average of 53% from intubation to extubation with no significant difference between the HH and HME groups. [7] In a randomized controlled trial that compared HME (163 patients) with HH (147 patients), none of the patients had ETT occlusion. [17] A systematic review of 18 randomized controlled trials found that the incidence of artificial airway occlusion was not different in patients treated with HMEs versus HHs (relative risk, 1.853; 95% CI, 0.792-4.338). [9] In the subgroup analyses, the incidence of airway occlusion was higher in HMEs compared with HHs with nonheated wire (relative risk, 3.776; 95% CI, 1.560-9.143). [9] The meta-regression found that studies with a high prevalence of pneumonia favored HMEs. [9] In a more recent study, ETT occlusion occurred in 25.5% of a cohort of patients with COVID-19, all were on HH. [5] We have observed a significant reduction in ETT occlusion cases after changing gas humidification practices. However, compliance with our humidification guideline was not 100% (90% of the ETT occlusion incidents occurred while the patients on HME in the after-period), which likely led to sporadic ETT occlusion incidents. This suggests the need for procedures that facilitate project sustainability, such as increasing staff involvement and buy-in and performing periodic audits to monitor progress with active feedback. [18] Improvement in ETT manufacturing may prevent ETT occlusion. Micropatterned ETTs significantly reduced intraluminal biofilm formation by 71% (P = 0.02) compared to standard care ETTs. [19] In a vitro model, the micropatterned ETTs had significantly less lumen occlusion compared with standard care ETTs. [19] Devices that clear mucus and debris from an ETT and restore luminal patency have been produced and seem to be effective. [20] In one study, 74 patients were randomized to either the use of a novel device for ETT cleaning every 8 h or standard of care (blind tracheal suction) only. [21] The device led to reduced mucus accumulation (P = 0.004) and reduced occlusion (6.3 \u00b1 1.7 vs. 8.9 \u00b1 7.6%; P = 0.04). [21] In addition, there was a trend in the device group toward reduced ETT-based biomass of bacteria known to cause ventilator-associated pneumonia. [21] The clinical consequences of ETT occlusion are not well studied. In our matched case-control analysis, we found that ETT occlusion was associated with a longer duration of MV, a longer stay in the ICU, and more need for tracheostomy. ETT occlusion may have led to the failure of spontaneous breathing and weaning trials, which would prolong MV. However, ETT occlusion was not associated with increased mortality. The raw costs of consumables needed for active humidification, which may reduce ETT occlusion incidents and the associated morbidity, was higher than those of HME-based humidification by approximately 36 USD for every 7 days of MV. This increase cost is relatively modest and might be justifiable.",
