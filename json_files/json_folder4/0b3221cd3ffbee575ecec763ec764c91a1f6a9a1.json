Nevertheless, because of robust health care infection prevention and control practices and policies that prevent patient-to-HCP transmission, it is possible that the greatest risk of COVID-19 transmission to HCP comes from exposure in their communities and, secondarily, between essential workers.\" 1 To learn more about the transmission of severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among healthcare workers (HCWs), we conducted an anonymous survey that was distributed by mass e-mail through interested infection control practitioners to all employees in their respective institution. The survey sheets were printed out and sent without sender information by mail to a central collecting address to guarantee that no backward data tracking was possible. No personal identifying data were collected, in accordance with German General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Because this was not a human-subject study, no ethics committee review was needed.",

There were also no differences in secondary attack rates in those with breakthrough infections after only 1 dose of the Comirnaty vaccine or Vaxzevria vaccine.

A near-distance transmission mode is more likely the dominant mode of transmission. This could be the case even for AGPs, given the high number of close distance and direct contacts described during the specific AGPs performed by our cohort that resulted in transmission despite use of FFP-2 or FFP-3 masks. Our assumptions are limited by the fact that no data about fit testing, the use of face shields or goggles, and other personal protective equipment for contact precautions were collected. However numerous personal observations of the removal procedure of FFP-2 mask confirm the potential of hand contamination, with the mask becoming a fomite as shown by fluorescein and bacteriophage markers in the literature. 6 This is especially likely after stressful events like resuscitation and emergency airway management, as demonstrated in simulation studies of donning and doffing of personal protective equipment. 7 Lentz et al 8 showed a protective effect of respirator use during APGs and lower odds ratios of infections in intensive care units, dedicated COVID-19 units, and the presence of personal protective equipment observers in a global case-control study.",
