After the respective acute response, frequencies returned to approximately pre-vaccination levels with similar rates of decline after 2 nd and 3 rd vaccination (week 24 and 40, respectively, Fig.1C ,E, sFig.2). Quantified cytoplasmic expression of the effector cytokine IFN\uf067\uf020indicated functional enhancement of spikespecific T cells upon 2 nd but not further upon 3 rd vaccination, while more cytoplasmic IFN\uf067\uf020was found in spike-specific CD4 T cells from senior adults recovered from COVID-19 (Fig.1F) . Thus, even a third BNT162b2 dose failed to induce durably enhanced quantities of spike-specific T cells and a functional quality reached after natural infection.",

Frequencies of CD40L+IFN\uf067+ CD4 T cells after culture of PBMC in the presence of the superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) are shown (A). n = 34, 35, 34, 14 donors were analyzed on W5, W24, W26, W40, respectively. P values were determined by two-tailed Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test. Representative analysis of flow cytrometry data depicting the detection of CD40L+IFN\uf067+ CD4 T cells in three donors at week 5 and week 26 are shown in (B). PBMC were stimulated in the presence or absence of spike protein peptide pool or SEB. Data of CD4 T cells are shown; frequencies of gated cells are indicated.",

In May 2021, blood samples were obtained by venipuncture from unvaccinated donors >80 years of age living in a retirement home, having recovered from COVID-19 after an outbreak with SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.221 in January 2021. All donor provided informed consent to participate in the study. Few participants were later excluded from the study for reasons unrelated to the study (sTable 2). Additionally, data of one donor was excluded from the whole T cell analysis due to strong erythrolysis (Polycythemia Vera) and data of one donor excluded on W40 due to sample clogging during the T cell assay.The study of patients with COVID-19 and vaccinations against COVID-19 was approved by the ethics committee of the medical faculty of the Philipps-University Marburg (study number 40/21-12032021).Sample processing and clinical labBlood serum was isolated from Serum Separator Clot Activator tubes (Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Frickenhausen, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and stored frozen until analysis.Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from fresh heparinized whole blood by density gradient centrifugation over Pancoll human (Pan Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany) after dilution with an equal volume of PBS at room temperature. PBMC were washed twice (500 x g, 10 min, 4 \u00b0C) in cold PBS supplemented with 0.2% BSA, counted manually, and resuspended in RPMI 1640 media (Gibco, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with penicillin,",

Brefeldin A (1 \u00b5g / mL) was added 2 hours after the start of the stimulation. The stimulation was stopped by adding 2 nM EDTA.
