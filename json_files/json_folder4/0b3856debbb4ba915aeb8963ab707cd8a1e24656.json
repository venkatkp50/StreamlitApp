Onset symptoms may start at any age, even though they generally occur in adulthood around 40 years of age [4] . Involuntary movements, i.e., chorea, do represent a typical onset manifestation in the adult patients, even though the atypical occurrence of onset symptoms may sometime predominate over choreic movements since the beginning of HD [5] . When HD starts before 21 years of age, it is conventionally defined as the juvenile-onset HD (JOHD). Among JOHD patients, the minors who manifest HD determine the pediatric variant (Pediatric HD or PHD). Approximately 5-10% of all HD cases may manifest with JOHD [6] , while the frequency of affected kids, who meet the definition of PHD, is still undefined [7] .",

These qualitative descriptions included heterogeneous cohorts of patients, selected according to unspecific clinical presentations, starting with either neurological or behavioral symptoms [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Most of these studies missed any preventive biological stratification based on the CAG mutation size in the HTT gene [16] . Currently, data delineating the early development of motor, cognitive and behavioral symptoms in childhood-onset patients with large expansions are still missing [17] . This is due to the difficulty in observing the rare and HE children since the very beginning of their pathological condition because they develop symptoms very early in life and progress very fast. Thus, the dramatic worsening of their condition severely limits the possibility to define the profile of early clinical changes, mainly in cognition.",

Spazio Huntington offers families the opportunity to meet a multidisciplinary team of specialists (e.g., neurologists, pediatricians and psychologists) in a nonmedical environment located at LIRH Foundation headquarters in Rome. According to the International Guidelines for Genetic Testing in Minors [19] , we performed the genetic test only in those children who showed suspicious clinical features, after the parents' signed informed consent. By 'suspicious clinical features' we mean clinical manifestations including neurological abnormalities, with or without cognitive and/or behavioral changes, associated with a motor impairment scored by the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scaletotal motor score (UHDRS-TMS) \u226510 and diagnostic confidence level (DCL) = 4 [8, 20] .",

The age at onset, medical history and any other relevant event were investigated by interviewing both parents, according to the published procedure which took into account all major motor and cognitive abnormalities that the child started to manifest since the birth [8, 11] . Cognitive and behavioral assessments were performed at the Neurology Unit of the Pediatric Bambino Ges\u00f9 Research Hospital in Rome. The neuropsychological testing battery included the measure of the cognitive level, adaptive functioning, receptive language. Specifically, all patients underwent the following standardized tests: Intelligence level was assessed using Leiter International Performance Scale [22] (M: 100, SD: 15) a non-verbal cognitive ability test suitable for individuals with speech problems. Adaptive skills were assessed by administering to the patients' caregivers the Adaptive Behavior Assessment Systems (M:100, SD:15), a standardized questionnaire assessing adaptive functioning in the conceptual, social, and practical domain [23] . Receptive vocabulary was evaluated using the Italian version of Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test [24] (M: 100, SD: 15). Target words were orally presented, and participants responded by pointing at the target-picture choosing among four images. Behavioral problems were evaluated through a parent's questionnaire, the Child Behavior Check List (CBCL) [25] , and a doctor semi-structured interview, the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia [26] . Moreover, obsessions and compulsions were screened using the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) a selfreport tool used to aid in the assessment of obsessive-compulsive symptoms and diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder in children [27] . The rating scale consists of 10 questions and gives a CY-BOCS total score ranging from 0 to 40 [27] .",

In two years, we had the opportunity to meet at-risk children and their parents once a month, with the obvious limitations due to COVID-19 disease due to SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus-2 restrictions occurred in 2019 and in 2020. In total, we met 25 kids and their parents. The Figure 1 shows a flow-chart that summarizes the whole cohort stratification. Of the 25 kids, four (two females) carrying highly expanded mutations included between 84 to 114 CAG repeats inherited by the affected father, manifested with PHD ( Table 1 ). The childhood age of onset was preschooler and ranged between age 2 and 4 years. The age of diagnosis ranged between 5 and 7 years with a mean diagnostic delay of 3 years (Table 1) . Clinical details, including first developmental steps, cognitive assays and main neurological features with UHDRS-TMS changes, were reported in Tables 2-4, respectively. The yearly longitudinal TMS profile is reported in Figure 2 . The medical history revealed that all patients' mothers had a regular delivery, and all patients had a regular perinatal period. Two of their mothers had an uneventful pregnancy (Patient 1 and 2, Table 2 ), while the other two had gestational diabetes and a transitory pregnancy hypertension in one case (Patient 3, Table 2 ) and transitory pregnancy hypertension in the other case (Patient 4, Table 2 ). The two girls had a medical history of developmental delay, while the two boys had apparently a regular psychic and motor development. Three out of four patients showed a mixed sleep disorder with frequent awakenings and difficulty in falling asleep with onset at the time of the diagnosis. They all reported drooling after the onset of motor symptoms and three of them developed progressive feeding difficulties in the following years ( Table 2 ). Three patients (Patient 1, 2 and 3) underwent a neuropsychological testing battery to measure cognitive level, adaptive functioning and receptive language. We found a mild intellectual disability ranging from 68 to 73 (Intelligence Quotient (IQ) M: 100, DS: 15), a receptive language delay and a poor adaptive functioning in all tested patients (Table 3) . We also conducted a behavioral evaluation through a semi-structured interview and parent report from which we disclosed a behavioral problem in three of four patients (Patients 1, 2 and 4) characterized by low impulsivity control and explosive outbursts of anger with disproportionate reaction to any provocation (Table 3) . Moreover, it was reported an avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder in one patient (Patient 1), attention deficit disorders in another patient (Patient 2) and social isolation in a patient (Patient 4). and stratification of the cohort, starting from a preliminary datasheet analysis of pedigrees and further interviews to families which were then met at \"Spazio Huntington-A Place for Children\". The genetic test was only provided after a suspicious neurological exam highlighted a diagnosis which was suggestive of PHD (pediatric HD). All the confirmed PHD cases had a brain magnetic resonance imaging consistent with the diagnosis of PHD, according to the documented evidence, as described in [12] . In some cases the follow-up of children of expanded CAG homozygous patients may offer an opportunity to prospectively follow-up young subjects many years in advance before onset manifestations. The patient code anonymizes the collection of patient's data and samples. Exp.: expansions; M/F: masculine/feminine; HD: Huntington disease. Among the most common features which appeared within the first years of life there were the unstable walking with propensity to falls and difficulty in the speech production and language acquisition ( Table 3) .",

Indeed, our program named \"Spazio Huntington-A Place for Children\", aims to approach families with at risk kids by meeting them in a nonmedical environment, where they may meet other kids with limited or no risk to cross adult patients, as it may happen in an 'ordinary' clinic. Our strategy, aiming to regularly meet and observe minors, may allow us to prospectively follow-up kids, since before they show signs and symptoms of HD, like we do with at risk adults, in the full respect of ethical guidelines. Thanks to such a program, we had the chance to see PHD kids at the beginning of their disease.",

The two young girls presented a history of developmental delay both for language and for motor areas (i.e., delay in gait initiation), while the two young boys apparently manifested by regular developmental milestones in the first year of life. Due to the limited size of our cohort, we cannot raise conclusions concerning the effect of the gender and of the mutation size on the developmental delay in HD. Larger numbers are needed to confirm our observation. However, one of the two boys, we had the opportunity to follow-up since the beginning of his clinical manifestations at age 3.5 and who showed the largest repeat expansion of 114 CAG, was objectively tracked since the very beginning of his clinical condition and showed very early, even though initial, cognitive changes. Such a prospective tracking of PHD does certainly represent an exceptional opportunity to highlight changes that are as close to premanifest life stage as possible in affected kids' life. We believe this strategy could therefore represent the best way to disclose the natural history of PHD. Our approach opens to the possibility to prospectively follow-up young subjects, years in advance before disease manifestations. We have to remember that this strategy has been successful to detect potential biomarkers in adults [34] .",

For instance, our findings need to be contextualized within the current HD scenario. For example, we and others reported the evidence of features of developmental delay in affected young girls and boys with large expansions [8, 10, 12] . The neurodevelopmental delay was retrospectively documented in two boys with very large mutations and age at onset of 18 months [12, 29] , one of them with very highly expanded CAG of about 200 repeats [29] . Therefore, we need to take into account the several biological (e.g., mutation length, genetic background, gene modifiers) and the yet unknown environmental (e.g., family environment, pre-delivery stressors, etc.) factors, that may theoretically interfere with the normal brain development and with the biological disease processes. Additional imaging and neuropathological studies in PHD patients are strongly needed to answer to the many, yet unsolved, questions concerning the contribution of developmental and degenerative processes to the timing of clinical disease presentation and progression [17] .",

Furthermore, the test we used to assay neuropsychological and behavioral changes may represent an important start point for further prospective analyses in this cohorts and might offer new tools for tracking the disease in children. Of note, all the four kids had the previously described brain imaging pattern, i.e., early abnormal loss of striatum volume [8] . Interestingly, the children who showed a suspicious clinical picture (with a pathological TMS), but resulted negative at the genetic test, did not show the same consistent pattern. Our observation highlights the brain MRI potentiality to ethically address a correct clinical and genetic screening in minors who are at risk of HD and show subtle symptoms. Our findings lend support to the hypothesis that the TMS has important implication in PHD kids by tracking the disease progression, while the volumetric brain MRI may have a critical implication as an additional, specific, diagnostic tool. We hope to contribute to elucidate the important role of imaging in PHD by exploring the brain function and metabolism, in addition to the brain structure, longitudinally by our in progress RAREST-JHD project.",
