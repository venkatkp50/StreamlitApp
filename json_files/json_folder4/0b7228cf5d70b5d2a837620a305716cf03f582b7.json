The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the toll exerted on their mental health had been overlooked during the early months of the pandemic. In the first lockdown, the needs of children and adolescents and their families were largely ignored apart from the child and adolescent psychiatrists all over Europe who worked tirelessly on their behalf. The lives of our young people were severely restricted and for many, this complex situation was incomprehensible. The protection of these children's rights and their welfare have finally come sharply into focus. But how can we ensure that this focus will continue? How can the neglect of children, adolescents and their families be remedied? What should the future hold for the next generation Europe after the acute phase of the pandemic?",

These organizations ensure the fundamental rights of children to be heard and to have their situation considered. The pandemic is shedding light on this fact like never before. The protection of minors must therefore be articulated as a state objective with constitutional status.",

It is already clear that the psychological stress on children, adolescents and families during the pandemic has increased due to the lockdown and other pandemic control restrictions. Furthermore, children and adolescents who were mentally ill or had severe emotional problems before the crisis now have an increased need for therapy and support. ESCAP, therefore calls on the EU and the national governments in Europe not to abandon and neglect the situation of these children but to comprehensively include their needs in the plan. The backbone of our society is the nuclear family and the households in which we live. This structure has helped us continue to function as a society by maintaining education, employment, and the economy through homeschooling and working from home during the pandemic lockdowns. Some children and families have managed this situation well, but many have not. This change in our way of working and being educated has had major implications for the psychological well-being of parents and children. Supporting families and re-establishing contact and therapy with children, especially those children with pre-existing conditions, is therefore no longer only socially appropriate but economically meaningful and absolutely essential as an investment in the future.",

Clinics, youth welfare offices and independent organizations often recorded a deceptive decrease in contacts that did not correspond to the real needs of the population. In addition, for the best part of a year, children and adolescents experienced major reductions in social contacts normally available through school, social, leisure, sports or artistic activities, all of which are a source of validation and structuring [2] . The removal of these essential social outlets together with other members of the family trying to home school and work from home, combined with individuals with pre-existing conditions is a \"perfect storm\" for escalating tensions and conflicts within the home and increasing the risks of abuse [16] .",

            "text": "Following the first lockdown a \"rebound effect\" that is, an overshooting of the demands to far more than the usual number of consultations was observed. Studies and statistics emerged suggesting that psychological distress, poverty, aggression and violence are likely to have increased in many families [6] [7] [8] . One can predict that these problems will continue to worsen as more lockdowns are being implemented. Emotional and behavioural problems that previously affected just under a fifth of all children and adolescents now occur in just under a third [9] . Counselling centres, outpatient clinics and clinics report noticeable increases in anxiety disorders, depression, suicidality and eating disorders. School refusal is not systematically noticed at the moment, although there are several different causes in the context of the pandemic ranging from being afraid of an infection all the way to enjoying life without school. Therefore, it seems highly likely that the whole range of problems will emerge when everyday life gradually normalizes. If this is the case, society must be prepared for this phase.",

In some countries, politicians are emphasizing the importance of opening kindergartens and elementary schools as the health burdens for children and families are becoming more apparent [10] . The commitment of teachers has been exemplary, but students cannot be expected to be at the same academic level as in previous years. According to the United Nations (2021), 214 million children, which is equal to 1 in 7 children, missed more than three-quarters of their face-to-face learning, while over 888 million face disruption in their education due to full and partial closures [11] . Failure to take this reality into account, by maintaining end-of-year exams comparable to previous years, will lead to school and professional training disruptions that will be a source of marginalization and subsequent social precariousness. Conversely, by maintaining constant success rates, comparable to the support and loans conceded to economy, the resilience of pupils and students will be promoted over several years. It is therefore essential to permit primary and secondary school students, vocational training students and students in general to demonstrate their resilience by catching up with their studies over the next 2-3 years by keeping fixed failure and success rates based on the rates of previous years.",
