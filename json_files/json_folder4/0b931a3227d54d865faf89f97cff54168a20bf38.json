MBCs not only persist after infection but continuously evolve and mature by progressive acquisition of somatic mutations in their variable region genes to improve affinity through an ongoing germinal center response, potentially driven by antigenic persistence Rodda et al., 2021; Sokal et al., 2021) . MBCs further drive the recall response after antigenic rechallenge by differentiating into new antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) displaying the diverse array of high-affinity-antibodies contained in the MBC repertoire. However, a strong convergence of the anti-RBD response across COVID-19 recovered and naive vaccinated individuals shaped by recurrent germline gene families has been described. This could favor viral mutational escape as one single mutation in the RBD can confer a selective advantage by reducing binding and neutralizing activity of antibodies (Garcia-Beltran et al., 2021; Greaney et al., 2021a) .",

This evolution in mutation profile could further be confirmed at the individual level for 2 patients with complete follow-up from 3 or 6 months post symptom onset to 2 months after boost ( Figure S3C -D, Table S3A ). This rapid increase in overall mutational load suggests that a fraction of matured, pre-existing MBCs was selectively mobilized upon vaccine response and (Yuan et al., 2021) , clones recognizing the K417 residue were highly enriched for IGHV3-53 and 3-66 genes, whereas clones recognizing the E484K/Q residue were mostly enriched for the IGHV1-2 and 1-69 genes ( Figure S5E , Table S2H ).

(***P<0.0001, *** P<0.001, **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05). See also Figure S2 and Table S2 . Figure S3 and Table S2 . Figure S4 and Table S2 . Figure S5 and Table S2 . ",

A large fraction of RBD-specific MBCs acquired a CD19 high CD71 + activated B cell phenotype in the days following the boost in naive individuals, similarly to M-CoV and S-CoV patients (Figure 2G-H, Table S2E), demonstrating that vaccine induced a robust expansion of an RBD-specific activated B cell population in all groups of donors. The proportion of RBD-specific activated B cells decreased over time, favoring an increase of RBD-specific resting MBCs consistent with the contraction of the vaccine response. This contraction appeared more pronounced in SARS-CoV-2 recovered patients, suggesting the persistence of a GC output in naive individuals (Figure 2H). Similar kinetics were observed for S-specific B cells (Figure S2G), although it should be noted that RBDspecific B cells still represented a smaller proportion of S-specific cells in naive than in SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals at the two-month time point (Figure 2I and S2H). mRNA vaccination maintains the overall diversity of the memory B cell repertoire. To address how mRNA vaccine boost affects the MBC repertoire, we then performed single cell sorting and culture of RBD-specific MBCs before, 7 days and 2 months after the boost in SARS-CoV-2 recovered patients, and 2 months after the boost in naive individuals (Figure 3A). We obtained a total of 2452 V H sequences from 4 S-CoV, 4-M-CoV and 3 naive individuals(Table S1A and C, Table S3A-H3). Clonally expanded RBD-specific MBC were found before vaccination in all SARS-CoV-2 recovered patients, representing 13-34% of total V H sequences for each donor(Figure 3BandFigure S3A). Vaccine-activated MBC showed no evidence of further clonal dominance and conserved their overall diversity, despite the major increase in MBC numbers. The fraction of the repertoire belonging to these clones varies from 19-39%, and remains comparable during contraction, with clones persisting over the pre/post vaccination period observed in all SARS-CoV-2 recovered patients. This overall clonal stability was reflected by similar Shannon entropy values at all studied time points (Figure S3B). Similar clonal expansion was observed in naive individuals(Figure 3C),",

RBD-specific MBCs from naive individuals obtained 2 months after the boost harbored low mutation numbers in their V H genes, consistent with the recruitment of naive B cells in the early phase of the vaccine response. It should moreover be noted that MBCs from naive individuals harbor even lower mutational load than MBCs from SARS-CoV-2 recovered patients at a similar 3 months time point after natural infection (Figure 3E). This suggests that natural infection might drive a faster maturation process of the MBC response. RBD-specific ASCs from SARS-CoV-2 recovered patients sorted 7 days after the boost showed clonal relationships with MBCs and highly mutated V H sequences (Figure 3F-H and Figure S2A, Table S3F and H). In contrast, RBD-specific ASCs from naive individuals displayed near germline V H sequences corresponding to the recruitment of naive B cells in the extra-follicular response (Figure 3G). Overall, these results show that the activation of the previously matured pool of MBCs by the mRNA vaccine does not bias the clonal diversity of their repertoire in previously infected individuals, while selectively amplifying MBCs with a higher mutation load. MBCs mobilized by mRNA vaccine contain high-affinity clones against VOCs. To determine the potency of the MBC compartment mobilized or elicited by mRNA vaccine against the main natural RBD variants, we first performed ELISA on 1583 supernatants from single-cell culture of sorted RBD-specific MBCs from 4 S-CoV, 4 M-CoV and 3 naive individuals (Figure 4A, Table S3A). To normalize for IgG concentration in culture supernatants, we plotted ELISA OD values for WT (Wuhan) vs. B.1.1.7 or B.1.351 RBD variants. Almost all supernatants recognized similarly the WT and B.1.1.7 RBD but 20% of them showed a 10-fold decrease in B.1.351 RBD recognition, with similar frequencies of affected supernatants in SARS-CoV-2 recovered and naive individuals (Figure 4A-B,",

However, overall affinity profiles were no longer different between recovered and na\u00efve donors when the B.1.351, P1, B.1.617.1 or B.1.617.2 variants were tested, with approximately 20-25% of clones with no or low affinity (KD>10 -8 M) in both groups (Figure 4C-D and Figure S4B-C). Somatic hypermutation of V H genes and antigen-driven affinity maturation against the WT RBD accounts for the higher frequency of high-affinity binders (KD<10 -9 M) in SARS-CoV-2 recovered compared to naive individuals (Figure 4E-F). As expected, the number of V H mutations showed reduced correlation with affinity against the B.1.351 RBD (Figure 4E-F), in line with the selection of these clones against the WT, and not the mutated RBD, during the GC maturation process. Two by two comparisons of binding affinities between the WT and the different RBD variants allowed us to validate the sensitivity of our approach with nearly all B.1.351 affected monoclonal antibodies (2 fold-increase in variant KD compared to WT KD) also affected in their binding of the P.1 RBD variant sharing similar set of mutations (namely N501Y, E484K and K417T/N) but not of the B.1.1.7 RBD variant which only harbors the N501Y mutation (Figure 5A, 5B). Additional comparisons with B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 RBD variants, which both harbor the L452R mutation in addition to E484Q for B.1.617.1 and T478K for B.1.617.2, but not the K417N/T mutation, further revealed cases of antibodies affected in their binding to one or more RBD variants (Figure S5A_D). Overall, the natural distribution of mutations in the various VOC RBDs (Figure 5C) allowed us to predict the identity of key binding amino acid residues (i.e., N501, K417, E484, L452, T478) within the RBD for 164 out of 382 tested MBC-derived monoclonal antibodies (Figure 5C-E). Antibodies affected in their recognition of B.1.351.1, P.1 and B.1.167.1 RBD were identified as binding to E484, with some antibodies using both E484 and L452 for binding, as illustrated by the threedimensional structure of the RBD (Figure 5C-E and Figure S5A-D).

The majority of RBD-specific MBCs clones efficiently neutralized D614G but a higher frequency of nonneutralizing clones was observed in naive compared to recovered patients (Figure 6AandTable S2I). Among potent D614G neutralizers, 40-60% of monoclonal antibodies efficiently neutralized B.1.351, without quantitative difference between M-CoV and naive individuals (Figure 6B) or clear association with the V H mutational load or binding affinity to the WT RBD (Figure 6C and Figure S6A). Nonetheless, potent neutralizing MBC-derived monoclonal antibodies could be detected in all analyzed donors, including SARS-CoV-2 naive vaccinees (ranging from 5 to 60% of the overall repertoire in the different donors (Figure S6B)). Loss of affinity against B.1.351 RBD mainly affected potent D614G neutralizers (Figure 6D), highlighting the strong evolutionary pressure at the virus level to selectively evade this part of the immune response. Plotting KD values for WT vs. B.1.351 RBD among potent D614G neutralizers further revealed four different profiles correlated with B.1.351 neutralization (Figure 6E): clones could be classified according to whether or not they retained a similar affinity for binding the B.1.315 RBD compared with the WT one (white and grey sectors, respectively, the grey sector corresponding to lower affinities); among these two categories, clones could be further divided as whether or not they retained neutralization potency against the B.1.315 virus (white and red dots, respectively). Accordingly, MBCderived monoclonal antibodies displaying similar affinities against both WT and B.1.351 RBD (white sector in Figure 6E) were enriched in strong neutralizers against the B.1.351 variant (white dots), but a subset of these antibodies did display reduced neutralization potency (red dots in white sector, Figure 6F).

We focused on the RBD because anti-RBD antibodies contribute to the majority of neutralizing antibodies and its mutations allow for immune escape of VOC(Ju et al., 2020;Robbiani et al., 2020), together with additional targets in the N-terminal domain of the Spike(McCallum et al., 2021).",

Thus, the expansion of the MBC pool does not seem to impair archives of the B cell specificities that have been selected during the amplification. In contrast, and mirroring early stages of the extrafollicular response after J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f infection(Woodruff et al., 2020), RBD-specific B cells expressing near germline recurrent V H genes with potent affinity are recruited after mRNA vaccination in naive individuals. MBC from naive individuals also acquired somatic mutations with time but harbored, 2 months after the boost, fewer mutations than SARS-CoV-2 recovered patients 3 months after COVID-19. Thus, whereas the MBC pool progressively matures in naive vaccinees, its maturation and amplification were less pronounced, resulting in less RBD-specific MBCs compared to SARS-CoV-2 recovered patients at 12 months after infection (respectively 7.8 and 3 times less than S-CoV and M-CoV) and 2 months after the boost (respectively 18.2 and 6 times less than S-CoV and M-CoV).As previously reported, most sera of SARS-CoV-2 recovered patients efficiently neutralized the B.1.351 variant after mRNA vaccine, which contrasted with the significant lower neutralization potency of the sera of naive vaccinated individuals(Goel et al., 2021;Reynolds et al., 2021;Stamatatos et al., 2021;Wang et al., 2021b). This likely reflects the quality and maturation of the B cell pool mobilized by the vaccine, i.e. an extrafollicular response in naive vaccinees and a mature MBC response in recovered patients.A fraction of recurrent and convergent V H genes of MBCs failed to recognize the B.1.351 variant RBD in both cohorts but a large proportion of clones retained high affinity against this variant.
