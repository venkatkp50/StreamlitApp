For example, dynamically induced spatial dispersion of action potential duration, QT prolongation, and alternans are clinical markers for arrhythmia susceptibility in regular and heart-failure patients that originate due to changes of the transmembrane voltage (V m ) and [Ca 2+ ] i . We present an optical-mapping methodology that permits simultaneous measurements of the V m -[Ca 2+ ] i signals using a single-camera without cross-talk, allowing quantitative characterization of favorable/adverse cell and tissue dynamical effects occurring from remodeling and/or drugs in heart failure. We demonstrate theoretically and experimentally in six different species the existence of a family of excitation wavelengths, we termed semasbestic, that give no change in signal for one dye, and thus can be used to record signals from another dye, guaranteeing zero cross-talk.",

            "text": "Heart failure (HF) is a global epidemic, affecting more than 64 million people worldwide (James et al., 2018) and is increasing in prevalence. In the US, about 6.9 million people have been diagnosed with HF, with an expected 24% increase to nearly 8.5 million by 2030 (Benjamin et al., 2018) . The prognosis is poor: 20% die within 1 year and 80% within 8 years, resulting in over 655,000 deaths annually (Virani et al., 2020) in the US alone. More than half of HF deaths are due to ventricular fibrillation (Packer, 1985) , and despite decades of study, the mechanisms by which HF predisposes patients to these ventricular arrhythmias are not well-understood. As a result, few treatment options are available. It is, therefore, crucial to identify how HF leads to the development of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Although it is well-known that fibrosis and myocardial ischemia (Tomaselli and Zipes, 2004) can cause conduction abnormalities and cardiac arrhythmias, there is growing recognition that abnormal intracellular calcium cycling plays a fundamental role in the pathology of HF (Hoeker et al., 2009; Aistrup et al., 2011) . Many studies have shown that disruptions in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca 2+ ] i ) cycling, along with the complex voltagecalcium bidirectional coupling, can lead to action potential (AP) repolarization abnormalities that promote arrhythmias Kamp, 2008, 2011; Hoeker et al., 2009; Louch et al., 2010; Aistrup et al., 2011) . This necessitates the development of effective methods that can investigate simultaneously the dynamics of the cell's transmembrane voltage (V m ) and [Ca 2+ ] i in cardiac tissue.",

            "text": "Optical mapping, developed in the mid-1970s, is the perfect methodology for the study of V m - [Ca 2+ ] i in cardiac electrophysiology due to a high spatial and temporal resolutions. In essence the method originally consisted in measuring changes in V m from changes in fluorescence intensity using V m sensitive dyes. For example, electrochromic V m dyes bind to the cell's membrane, and their absorption and emission spectra blueshifts a few nanometers as the cell membrane depolarizes. By blocking the excitation light and part of the emission spectra with a long-pass-filter (LPF) placed over an electro-optical sensor (camera), fluorescence intensity is measured in practice (Figure 1 ). For small spectra shifts, the normalized change in fluorescence intensity ( F/F) is given by (F -F 0 ) / F 0 , where F 0 is the fluorescence intensity when the cell's membrane is polarized (the resting membrane potential), and F when the cell's membrane is depolarized (any other transmembrane potential) which to first approximation it is linearly proportional to the cell's transmembrane potential and thus closely reproduce the action potential ( Figure 1D ). With unprecedented high spatial and temporal resolution, optical mapping with V m sensitive dyes have been used to characterize wave propagation across the tissue surface (Barone et al., 2020 ) and depth (Kelly et al., 2013 ), during regional ischemia (Sidorov et al., 2011) and provide evidence of reentrant waves as mechanisms of lethal arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation (Davidenko et al., 1992; Gray et al., 1998; Cherry and Fenton, 2008 ) that affect the electromechanical coupling (Christoph et al., 2018) . Additionally, invasive and non-invasive techniques can also be characterized using optical mapping, such radio-frequency ablation outcome (Paredes et al., 2020; Pollnow et al., 2020) , and low-energy defibrillation techniques (Li et al., 2011; Ji et al., 2017; Uzelac and Fenton, 2020 which is one of the mechanisms leading to ventricular arrhythmias (Pastore et al., 1999; Watanabe et al., 2001; Gizzi et al., 2013) .",

These systems used overlapping excitation bands for the two dyes with separate emission bands split and sent to the two photodetectors, one to measure V m and one for [Ca +2 ] i with a spatial resolution of 16 \u00d7 16 pixels. Since then, other dual systems with higher resolution (Holcomb et al., 2009 ) have been developed, including those designed with a single camera for monolayers (Scull et al., 2012) and whole hearts (Lee et al., 2011 (Lee et al., , 2012a Herron et al., 2012) . The advantages of a single detector based systems include: (i) Significantly less expensive as they do not require multiple detectors/cameras; (ii) There is no need for spatial alignment of the detectors to have the same field of view, increasing complexity of setups, and possible decrease of the field of view (Holcomb et al., 2009); (iii) No need to use a dichroic mirror to separate the V m and [Ca +2 ] i fluorescence signals for each sensor, decreasing light intensity, that is signal to noise ratio (SNR).",

Different methods have been proposed to achieve dual V m and [Ca 2+ ] optical mapping measurement. Two-camera setups require complex spatial alignment of the cameras and optical elements to split the two fluorescent signals, with only one signal reaching each camera (Holcomb et al., 2009) . The complexity of the two-camera setups can be avoided by a single camera for dual V m and [Ca 2+ ] i signal measurements. The fundamental principle behind single-camera-based methods is to separate the V m and [Ca 2+ ] fluorescence signals based on differences in excitation and/or emission spectra of the two dyes used. Existing methods (Lee et al., 2011 (Lee et al., , 2012a are limited to the particular choice of fluorescent dyes, significantly limiting their application. Additionally, there is no established methodology for designing and implementing a single-camera-based dual V m and [Ca 2+ ] i measurement technique which provides zero-cross talk of the two fluorescence signals. The excitation light band for a V m dye preferably would not excite a [Ca 2+ ] i dye and vice versa. However, true spectral separation is not possible (with currently available dyes), but illuminating at a wavelength where one or the other dye is not sensitive to the parameter of interest is sufficient. This is essential as the complex bidirectional coupling between V m and [Ca 2+ ] i (Shiferaw and Karma, 2006) is important when investigating under which HF conditions (Gorski et al., 2015) V m or [Ca 2+ ] i are responsible for triggering an arrhythmia.",

            "text": "This study presents a theoretical framework to analyze and select the optimal dyes/filters combination to achieve zerocross talk for dual V m -[Ca 2+ ] optical mapping applications for simultaneous measurement of V m and [Ca 2+ ] i signals, using a single sensor. The methodology is based on alternating excitation bands for each fluorescent dye in sync with the camera, recording each signal in alternating frames in order to overcome the challenges of mutual cross-talk of the two signals. Excitation at wavelengths we term semasbestic results in no change of fluorescence of a voltage-sensitive dye as V m changes, which is suitable to excite a [Ca 2+ ] i dye with no cross-talk. We demonstrate the existence of a family of these excitation wavelengths and the advantage of this methodology experimentally with optical mapping measurements performed in six different animal species, while also showing how previous methods exhibit signal cross-talk. Furthermore, opticalmapping methods using V m and [Ca +2 ] i dyes have a broad range of applications, suitable for research of cardiomyocyte cultures (Fast and Ideker, 2000) , studying drug effects on heart FIGURE 1 | Mechanisms of measurement with an electrochromic V m dye. (A) The Gaussian absorption (blue) and emission curves (red) are good fits for a given electrochromic V m dye for illustration purposes, with solid lines for polarized membrane and leftward shifted dotted lines for maximally depolarized membrane by a propagating AP. For excitation at the isosbestic point and for a given LPF on the camera side passing only part of the emission spectra, as illustrated with the solid (black) vertical lines, F/F is always negative. F/F = 0 can only be achieved if the entire emission spectrum is obtained (solid blue vertical line), thereby not dependent on the optical setup, the \u03bb LPF value. Excitation left of the isosbestic point results in an amplitude increase of the emission spectra due to absorption coefficient increase with the shift of the absorption spectra. Depending on the filter \u03bb LPF , overall F/F sign can be negative or positive, and in between, there is a particular \u03bb LPF such that positive change cancels the negative change resulting in F/F = 0, for specific \u03bb Exc , termed semasbestic wavelength. (B) Theoretically calculated map of F/F magnitude values as a function of \u03bb Exc and \u03bb LPF , showing the transition from positive to negative F/F, and continuous line of semasbestic wavelengths, F/F = 0 isochrone line, for each \u03bb Exc\u03bb LPF pair. (C) Illustration of the experimental setup. (D) APs from optical mapping measurements on isolated rabbit heart near a semasbestic wavelength. A 10 nm wide BP excitation filter was used of 540 nm nominal center wavelength along different LPFs on the camera's side. Due to low F/F values SNR is low. However, ensemble averaging (stacking) increases SNR without filtering in post-processing. (E) Quadratic fit curves from F/F simulated values (B), for four different LPFs of the same \u03bb LPF values as LPF used in F/F measurements on isolated hearts. (F) Quadratic fit curves from F/F magnitude values for four different LPFs. Optical mapping recordings were performed on isolated rabbit heart for across a wide range of excitation wavelengths, from 500 to 660 nm. Zero crossings correspond to the semasbestic wavelengths. All \u03bb LPF values of LPFs are experimentally measured. electrophysiology (Bedut et al., 2016; Streit and Kleinlogel, 2018; Gunawan et al., 2021; Uzelac et al., 2021) , gene therapies on V m and [Ca 2+ ] i dynamics in cardiac tissue and in other organs such as the brain (Baker et al., 2005; Ma et al., 2016; Turrini et al., 2017) as well as in other biological systems driven by V m and [Ca 2+ ] i dynamics like in C-Elegans (Venkatachalam et al., 2016) .",

In this study, we establish a methodology to design bi-modal optical-mapping systems with the selection of the correct optical filters, given a choice of V m and [Ca 2+ ] i dyes. We demonstrate that for a given electrochromic V m dye, a continuous range of excitation wavelengths exist that result in F/F = 0 (no fractional change of fluorescence) dependable on a given a LPF cut-on wavelength (\u03bb LPF ) and the spectral response of the camera used.",

Among obtained semasbestic wavelengths from the different animal species, no statistically significant difference was observed, with the largest variation found only in pig hearts (Figure 2A) . We attribute this difference to the surface fatty tissue layer (that other animals did not have) attenuating non-linearly the emitted fluorescence spectra (van Veen et al., 2004) , which resulted in a small leftward shift of the semasbestic wavelengths. One-way ANOVA tests were performed with and without the semasbestic wavelengths obtained in pig hearts, and found that even when including the semasbestic wavelengths of the pig hearts, P-values did not reach statistical significance (P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant). Therefore, semasbestic wavelengths ( Figure 2B ) appear to be independent of animal species, and a curve can be fitted to relate semasbestic wavelengths as a function of \u03bb LPF for V m JPW-6003 dye, (Figure 2C) .",

The sequence of images was recorded with the odd frames corresponding to ideally no change in V m fluorescence (DFF = 0) and even frames corresponding to the change in V m signal fluorescence (Figure 3) . For odd frames, the off-the-shelf BP excitation filters were used chosen to match as close as possible the ideal semasbestic point corresponding to each of the four different LPFs, and coupled with 525 centered green LED. For even frames, the BP excitation filter of the effective \u03bb Exc = 660.0 nm wavelength was used.

The cross-talk is represented as a fractional change in the V m dye fluorescence. The optical action potential traces corresponding to the same image pixel for even and odd image sequences for direct comparison.

Excitation of the V m dye with longer wavelengths than the isosbestic point and using longer \u03bb LPF on the camera side, increases F max /F magnitude (Figures 1B-F;  Supplementary Figure 5) .

Odd frames were acquired using off-the-shelf excitation BP filters selected to closely match the semasbestic points (\u03bb Sem ) corresponding to the \u03bb LPF of the four LPFs. \u03bb Exc wavelengths are effective excitation wavelengths of the BP filters.

Since this effective excitation wavelength has to match the semasbestic wavelength, any mismatch will result in a non-zero F/F value. However, the introduced error is small, and the V m signal change is less than 0.5% using an excitation wavelength in the \u00b110 nm range around the semasbestic wavelength. The fractional changes were measured only with the V m dye. Adding the Ca dye, the amount of cross-talk will be even lower, as the fractional change is measured in respect to the summed baseline fluorescence of both dyes ( Figure 2D) .

With a 660 nm centered LED, BP filters with a 660 nm center wavelength of up to 50 nm BP width can be used.

The optical mapping system with the design parameters described above was used to measure V m -[Ca 2+ ] i signals with a single-camera in isolated hearts of Rabbit, Cat, Guinea Pig, Pig (Figure 4) , and monolayer cell culture of neonatal rats (Figure 5) . A restitution protocol was performed for each species, where V m -Ca signals were recorded at decreasing pacing cycle lengths (PCLs) until a conduction block or ventricular fibrillation (VF) occurs. At shorter PCLs, instabilities in V m or [Ca i ] at the cellular level lead to the development of beat to beat alternans in action potential duration (APD) (Pastore et al., 1999) , and intracellular calcium duration (CaD) . Through tissue-level coupling, these instabilities lead to complex and irregular spatial dispersion in AP repolarization and in CaD (Figure 4) , forming dangerous spatially discordant alternans. Spatially discordant alternans are equivalent to T-wave alternans in clinical ECGs (Pastore et al., 1999; Uzelac et al., 2021) , the clinical marker for arrhythmia susceptibility and sudden cardiac death (Walker and Rosenbaum, 2003; Verrier et al., 2009) . Among species, the differences in ionic membrane channel densities such as potassium repolarization channels and lack of specific ionic channels create differences in AP morphology. In addition, through V m -Ca bidirectional coupling, other differences across species exist in terms of handling the intracellular Ca cycling (Figure 4) . For rabbit, cat, and guinea pig heart, alternans in Ca seem to drive V m alternans leading to spatial dispersion of AP repolarization. In contrast, no alternans are observed in V m nor Ca signals for pig hearts, yet pig hearts develop VF at faster PCLs in the restitution protocols. Understanding these differences across species could lead to a better understanding of different arrhythmia mechanisms modalities and relate them to human heart physiology to more complete understanding arrhythmia in human hearts, devise novel treatments, and help with the global epidemic of HF.",

With off-the-shelf bandpass excitation filters of slightly different effective excitation wavelengths than corresponding semasbestic wavelengths (Figure 3) we achieved near zero-cross talk. For a true zero cross-talk, custom manufactured bandpass filters matching the semasbestic point would be needed, and one would need to take into account the LED excitation light spectral profile within the filter passband. The absorption spectra of a given electrochromic V m dye is spectrally shifted when the dye is bounded within a cell membrane due to a strong interaction between the dye's molecule electric dipole momentum and the cell membrane electric field (Matson et al., 2012) . Therefore, contemporary spectroscopy methods to obtain the dye absorption and emission spectra, dissolving the dye in a solvent such as ethanol and using a spectrometer, would result in different semasbestic wavelengths than when performing equivalent measurements on isolated hearts stained with the dye. In this study we conclude that obtained semasbestic wavelengths for a given electrochromic V m dye, are dependent only on the excitation wavelength \u03bb Exc and corresponding \u03bb LPF of the dye emission band. As validated on isolated hearts of six different species, the semasbestic wavelengths seems to be independent of the species (as validated on six different species and cell culture monolayers).",

            "text": "While the presented methodology is demonstrated with the semasbestic wavelengths of JPW-6003 V m dye and using Rhod-2 [Ca 2+ ] i dye, the described methodology does not depend on the choice of the dyes. It applies to any other electrochromic V m resulting in a different set of semasbestic wavelengths. Therefore, depending on the user's need, we provide a range of semasbestic excitation wavelengths that can be used with JPW-6003 V m sensitive dye, and a methodology to obtain the same for other V m sensitive dyes. We followed the common practice in optical mapping to use an LPF to record V m signal fluorescence. Excitation on the positive-slope side of the excitation spectrum induced an increase in fluorescence during an action potential, which is balanced by recording from the negative-slope side of the emission spectrum. Other classes of semasbestic points may exist with different designs of the emission filter. For example, it is also possible to create a semasbestic wavelength along the negative-slope side of the excitation spectrum and balance this by recording from a band on the positive-slope side of the FIGURE 4 | Single-camera dual V m \u2212 Ca measurements in isolated hearts of different species. (A) Arrhythmic effects under dynamic pacing, shown as spatial dispersion of APD and CaD across tissue for different species for even and odd beats. The spatial dispersion indicates an increased susceptibility to arrhythmia. APD values are obtained from 50% signal rise in amplitude till 50% AP repolarization. Numbers to the right indicate 3rd and 97th percentile APD values expressed in milliseconds. CaD values are obtained as the integral from 50% rise in amplitude till 50% decrease. Blue-red patterns show variations in APD and CaD ( APD, CaD) between even and odd beats (discordant alternans), showing regions alternating out of phase and separated with the nodal lines (white lines). Spatially discordant alternans are the counterpart of T-wave ECG alternans, a well-known marker for arrhythmia susceptibility. Although all species do develop arrhythmia under dynamic pacing, the electrophysiology across species is very different. Spatially discordant alternans are the most pronounced in rabbits, while pig hearts show very little APD and CaD dispersion, with insignificant differences between even and odd beats. (B) V m and Ca representative AP signals showing temporal alternans for different species. emission spectrum. However, the close separation between the dye absorption and emission spectra (Supplementary Figure 1 ) may preclude such an approach for JPW-6003 dye, while it may be feasible for other V m dyes.",

            "text": "Optical mapping methods using fluorescent dyes are wellestablished and very important to measure signals from cells and tissue. The use of optical mapping systems is rapidly growing. Nowadays, it is becoming a common tool in many research labs as the equipment is no longer prohibitively expensive (Lee et al., 2017) with novel advances in CMOS sensor technology. The increasing number of research groups are using optical mapping to investigate V m -[Ca +2 ] i on biological tissues, and optical mapping methods are even becoming accessible in university classrooms. Simultaneous measurement of V m and [Ca 2+ ] i enables many studies in the area of electrophysiology related to the V m and [Ca 2+ ] i dynamic and their bidirectional coupling. For example, cardiac arrhythmia can be caused by AP spatial dispersion driven with Ca alternans at the cellular level (Supplementary Videos 1, 2) . Dual V m and [Ca 2+ ] i measurements are necessary to understand the underlying mechanism leading to arrhythmia (Groenendaal et al., 2014) , and optical mapping studies can be performed even in combination with contractions (Christoph et al., 2018) to study the mechanical stretching effects on cardiac electrophysiology. Time-resolved series of V m and [Ca 2+ ] i signals at high spatiotemporal resolution are generally applicable to other electrophysiology related studies besides HF. For example, many drugs affect the AP repolarization phase blocking the potassium channels and prolonging the APD, the cellular mechanism of long-QT. Optical mapping provides integrative studies at both the cellular and tissue level to understand how drugs affect the ionic channel currents and intracellular Ca dynamics and to understand the drug's safety profile and associated antiarrhythmic or proarrhythmic at the tissue level (Uzelac et al., , 2021 ), which would not be possible to understand, studying the drug's effect at the cellular level only. The methodology developed here can also be used to investigate other biological systems with V m -[Ca +2 ] i driven dynamics such as the brain (Rad et al., 2017) the pancreas (Yang and Berggren, 2006) , smooth (Nelson et al., 1990) , and skeletal (Flucher and Tuluc, 2017 ) muscle among others.",

(B) Normalized V m and Ca signals obtained from processed raw recordings showing Ca signal lagging in time. (C) Representative unfiltered V m and Ca signal traces with no filtering expressed as a relative change. In cell culture monolayers, Ca signals have significantly higher SNR than V m signals originating only from the dye bound to the cell membrane. The amount of cross-talk and the presence of V m signal in Ca signal with excitation at near the semasbestic point(Exc550)results is a small yet negligible cross-talk compared to the amplitudes of the signals.",
