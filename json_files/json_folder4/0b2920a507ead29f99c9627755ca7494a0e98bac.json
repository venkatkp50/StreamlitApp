This called for an urgent need for vaccinations against COVID-19 and almost 120 different SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were being manufactured by the end of 2020 [2] . The mRNA-1273 vaccine, popularly called the \"Moderna vaccine\" is a nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccine that has been widely administered in the United States since December 2020 [3] . In the clinical trials of the vaccine, the side effects typically happened within seven days of getting vaccinated but the severity of these side effects were mostly mild to moderate. Low-grade fever, myalgia, chills, malaise and headache were more common after the second dose of the vaccine. A very small number of people reported severe side effects that required active management or even hospitalization [4] .",

According to the WHO (World Health Organization) standardized causality assessment, it was concluded influenza vaccinations associated with ITP with an odds ratio of 3.8 (95% confidence interval 1.5-9.1) [3, 6] . There are also case reports published describing vaccination-related ITP and increased platelets associated IgG (pAIgG) antibodies following the same, further strengthened by resolution with corticosteroid treatment [7, 8] .

However, the fact that the platelet count was within normal limits two weeks prior to the vaccine ruled out chronic bone marrow suppression related to cirrhosis. HIV, influenza, COVID-19 infection were ruled out and the rest of the auto-antibody panel were also reported negative.",

With an exception of an angry red rash being called \"COVID arm\" in new media, there is no peer-reviewed scholarly literature related to any of the COVID-19 vaccines. We attribute the purpuric rash in our case as a side effect of the m-RNA 1273 vaccine; though it could have been precipitated by the underlying thrombocytopenia, liver cirrhosis and Hepatitis C infection. With widespread distribution and administration of COVID-19 vaccine, we could anticipate more data regarding the side effect profile of the COVID-19 mRNA and other vaccines and the mechanism and pathophysiology of such side effects. The safety of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines with underlying history of hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and thrombocytopenia also needs to be investigated with future studies. COVID-19 vaccines reportedly have very few side effects and in the background of benefits over risks from the vaccine, this article should not alter the recommendations to take the vaccine. Nevertheless, we wish to alert the clinicians to this possible association of ITP post-vaccination.",
