Although the association with acetylsalicylic acid use has been reported, its administration was not temporally related to the clinical presentation 6 . AGEP has been related to an immunologicallymediated type IV hypersensitivity reaction 7 . After exposure to the causative agent, antigen-presenting cells cause activation of specific CD4 and CD8 T cells that migrate to the dermis and epidermis, leading to apoptosis of keratinocytes, epidermal vesicle formation, chemotaxis of neutrophils via Interleukin-8, activation and transformation of vesicles into sterile pustules due to a predominant Th1 cytokine profile. Additionally, an increased production of interferon (IFN)-g and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor has been documented, although some patients may show a Th2 cytokine pattern with high production of interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-5 and secondary eosinophilia. Histological features are characterized by spongiform intracorneal, subcorneal, and/or intraepidermal pustules with papillary dermal edema containing neutrophilic and eosinophilic infiltrates, as observed in Figure 2 1,2 .",
