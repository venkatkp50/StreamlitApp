Based on the WHO's direction for containment (World Health Organization, 2020) , countries implemented varying levels of restrictions to stop the spread of the virus. In Australia, international borders were closed to all non-residents, state and territory borders were also closed severely restricting national travel, social venues and restaurants were closed, large gatherings were prohibited, people were asked to work from home where possible and social distancing rules were imposed (Australian Government, 2020a) . Initially warnings were given, followed by monetary fines for offenders. This was coupled with a public health campaign around hand washing, social distancing and getting tested. In contrast, the Government of India ordered a nationwide lockdown, limiting the movement of the entire 1.3 billion population (Gettleman & Schultz, 2020) . People were instructed to stay at home and those going out had to carry signed forms declaring reasons for travel (Government of India, 2020a) . All offices, businesses and public transport were shut and both social distancing and wearing masks in public became mandatory. Violation of public health rules brought fines or imprisonment.",

Given the variations in experience with online delivery within their programmes, the transition to remote delivery entirely may have a variable impact on nursing students internationally. In addition to the theoretical components, undergraduate nurses must complete clinical placements to satisfy regulatory requirements for qualification as a nurse. Previous studies during an epidemic have reported that nursing students are fearful of increased risks in the clinical environment (Dewart et al., 2020; Wong et al., 2004) . The combination of changed delivery of theoretical components and increased risk in clinical placements creates significant additional pressures on nursing students.",

Knowledge (4 items), source of information about COVID-19 (2 items), coping strategies (4 items) and preventative behaviours (9 items) were assessed using investigator developed questions. Students had to rate each item on a scale of strongly agree to strongly disagree. Anxiety was assessed using the Six-Item State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) (Marteau & Bekker, 1992) and five investigator developed questions. The reliability coefficient for the six-item STAI has been reported to be 0.82 (Marteau & Bekker, 1992) .

This study found the Australian student cohort had higher difficultly eating, sleeping and concentrating than their Indian nursing student counterparts. This result is congruent with the overall mean anxiety scores. A possible reason for the higher anxiety scores, hence difficulty eating, sleeping and concentrating, in the Australian cohort is that they have not previously encountered other infectious disease epidemics or endemics that Indian students may be accustomed to. India's burden of infectious diseases are vast, ranging from tuberculosis to enteric pathogens such as typhoid and cholera and to H1N1 pandemic influenza (John et al., 2011) .

The usual lifestyle pattern of the Indian cohort before lockdown was a highly structured and very tight schedule of study and clinical duties and they lived in university accommodation. As a result of the intensity of structure, while living in university accommodation, the students do not undertake much exercise. During the lockdown period, the university accommodation was shutdown requiring Indian students to live with their families. Hence the highly regulated approach that filled their day when living the university accommodation relaxed, and they found that they had time for exercise. In addition, the university provided planned yoga sessions through their volunteer programme, receiving yoga videos each weekend for the week ahead. Yoga is known to have positive effects and can assist with reducing anxiety (Hofmann, Andreoli, Carpenter & Curtiss, 2016) , and the planned approach to reducing students anxiety during lockdown appears to have been beneficial.",

Both student cohorts indicated that their respective universities had provided them with sufficient information about COVID-19. However when compared to the Australian cohort, the majority of the students in the Indian cohort indicated that they received information about COVID-19 from social media. This could be due to the stoppage of printing mainstream newspapers thereby driving people to obtain their information via social media. Numerous people have obtained information via social media hence diffusion of information and misinformation about COVID-19 via Social Media has been described use as an 'Infodemic'(Cinelli et al., 2020). Just after lockdown, the Indian student cohort created a WhatsApp group and forwarded all information from the university as well as relevant information from social media regarding COVID-19 to the group. Although the Indian cohort demonstrated significantly higher sufficient knowledge of COVID-19, both scores were relatively high. Research regarding the H1N1 respiratory pandemic showed that knowledge had a significant influence on attitudes and practices (",
