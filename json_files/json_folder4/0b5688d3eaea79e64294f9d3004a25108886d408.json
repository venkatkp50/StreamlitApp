The healthcare setting has, however, not yet realised the potential of technology solutions to facilitate communication between patients and healthcare providers. While the procedural and policy requirements of healthcare systems will ultimately drive such solutions, understanding the preferences and attitudes of patients is essential to ensure that technology implemented in the healthcare setting facilitates communication in safe, acceptable, and appropriate ways. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine patient preferences for using technology to communicate with health service providers about symptoms experienced following discharge from the hospital. Methods: Primary data were collected from patients admitted to a large metropolitan hospital in Australia during three consecutive months in 2018. Participants were asked about their daily use of technology including use of computers, email, phone, text messaging, mobile applications, social media, online discussion forums, and videoconference. They were then asked about their use of technologies in managing their health, and preferences for use when communicating about symptoms with health service providers following discharge from hospital.",

Almost 60% of patients would prefer to return to hospital if they were experiencing symptoms of concern. However, if patients experienced symptoms that were not of concern, over 60% would prefer to communicate with the hospital via telephone or using technology.

Despite recognition that ICT enhances communication possibilities, health services have not yet realised the full potential of technologies in practice [2] . Factors identified by healthcare workers critical to adoption include: ease of technology use, integration with workflow, evidence of positive impact on patient outcomes, ability to interact with others, data security, and resourcing [3] [4] [5] [6] . Where ICT is used in clinical practice, it has primarily been unilateral in that the health service or clinician initiates communication with patients, or uses technology in health management without patient involvement [7] . With growing demands on health services, and as patients are increasingly encouraged to engage more in self-management of their health [8] , understanding patient preferences for initiating communication with health service providers warrants exploration.",

Other technologies such as ePROMs assist in systematically and comprehensively monitoring and improving symptoms resulting in reduced data entry burden for clinicians [11] [12] [13] . Patient portals for EMRs can assist with clinical history documentation, clinician prescribing, and messaging between healthcare staff and patients [7] . A review of studies about patient preferences for discharge communication found that research to date has only evaluated the provision of discharge information at the time of discharge (e.g. written or verbal summaries provided by the health service provider) [14] . Only one study has surveyed patients with hypertension in the outpatient clinic setting about use and preferences of ICTs for information and communication. Still, participants were not asked about their preferences relative to more traditional modes of communication (i.e., inperson or via a telephone call) [15] .

Patients with different clinical conditions may experience a range of symptoms following discharge. It can be difficult for some patients to determine which symptoms are of clinical significance (i.e., whether a symptom warrants intervention by their healthcare provider) [16] . A symptom that is not of particular concern for a patient may be of significance to their healthcare. The ability for effective two-way communication about symptoms is, therefore, of great importance to the patient and the clinician. With the increasing availability of digital technologies, the possibility exists for patients to communicate about health needs electronically from the comfort of their homes, avoiding unnecessary trips to the hospital, saving both time, travel, and costs [17] . Little is known about individuals' preference for communicating with health service providers through the use of digital technologies. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to report on patient experience with, and preferences for, using a variety of technologies to communicate with health service providers about symptoms following discharge from the hospital. Further we seek to explore demographic factors that may be helpful in identifying patients with unique communication preferences.",

For the characteristic 'geographic area of residence', participants were asked to provide their postal (zip) code. The code was then categorised based on the Australian Standard Geographical Classification System (i.e., 'metropolitan', 'inner regional', 'outer regional/remote'). Participants were asked to write in free-text their condition requiring treatment and planned treatment. Responses were then categorised by two clinicians based on the hospital speciality areas (i.e., 'orthopaedic', 'cardiac', 'oncological', 'gastrointestinal' or 'other'), and if the treatment involved 'surgery' or was for 'investigation or medical care', respectively. Members from the hospital patient advisory group provided input about the survey readability, and the survey was pilot tested with 33 admitted medical patients. Minor wording modifications were made to the survey after testing. Responses collected during the pilot testing were excluded in the final analyses.",

At least half of the patients in this study reported using some technologies such as computers, the internet, and the telephone (including text messaging) to manage their health. This finding is consistent with reported trends of individuals' rapidly increasing uptake of technology, such as the internet, to manage their health [19] . However, only a small proportion of patients were interested in using new technologies that they were not currently using in general daily activities in managing their health. The reluctance to utilise more technology-enabled approaches in the context of healthcare may be indicative of a lack of experience with the technology for health management [20] [21] [22] , and concerns about privacy [22, 23] . It may also be reflective of an older demographic of patients who may have misconceptions about the difficulty of using technology, or issues with trust [24] . Our findings show differences in patient preferences for communicating with the healthcare team posthospital discharge following a planned admission. Nearly 60% of patients preferred to return to hospital to communicate about symptoms that were of concern to them, but at least 30% preferred to communicate via telephone. If patients experienced symptoms that did not cause them concern, two-thirds preferred to use either telephone or other technology to communicate with the health service. These results may suggest that many patients would prefer not to return to the hospital for follow-up unless they were experiencing symptoms of concern. Our findings should not only prompt renewed interest in the role of follow-up telephone calls for patients discharged from the hospital [25] but the role of virtual follow-up visits with health services [26] .",

All orthopaedic patients received a planned surgical intervention. While all the other conditions where planned as well, the reasons for admission were mixed (i.e., surgical, investigation and medical). Patients with a cardiac condition may feel more acutely at risk of rapid deterioration, and perhaps this finding reflects the perceptions of the anticipated possible outcomes between conditions.

Research on technology use in healthcare has predominantly focused on the experiences of patients with particular conditions and on patients that have used technology [24] . In this study, we sought to understand the preferences of both those who do and who do not currently use technology in daily life and health management. Investigation of experiences across different conditions warrants further investigation in order to inform appropriate health service responses for patients with a variety of conditions. Income may affect preferences for communicating about symptoms that are not of concern post-hospital discharge. Patients that reported earning over 100,000 AUD per household per year were more likely than respondents with lower incomes to prefer to use telephone or technology-enabled forms of communication. Earning over 100,000 AUD per household per year was also associated with having higher educational qualifications in this study. Higher-income and education have been previously associated with greater technology use to manage health, such as patient portals [30] and smartphone applications [31] . Some have suggested that there is an emerging 'digital divide' where patients that lack access to computers and smartphones for a variety of reasons could miss out on health innovations that use digital technology [32] . However, a recent review (albeit of few studies) reported no associations with patient characteristics (including income) and digital health tool use [33] . Age was significantly associated with different preferences in communication about symptoms. Older people were less likely to prefer using technology over attending in-person when they had symptoms not of concern. It has been reported previously that younger people are more likely to be users of mobile health applications [31] , and older persons are less likely to access and use the internet. However, older people were more likely to prefer making a telephone call over attending in-person when they had a concerning symptom. This finding may be because older people have had more experience with illnesses and have had more time to develop an understanding of their conditions and health services [34] [35] [36] . Alternatively, older persons may seek to negotiate a delay in admission to the hospital [37] . One review of health-related decision-making in older adults found that limited research in this area exists, however, delays in treatment-seeking by older persons were noted [38] . The desire to remain independent, the influence of others, availability and perceptions of health services available, and having access to information may also affect decisions to seek treatment [39] .",

These results represent a small proportion of patients presenting for a planned admission at a metropolitan hospital that predominantly performs surgical or investigational procedures. Therefore, the preferences for communication may not be generalisable to other patients with either different characteristics, those receiving different types of interventions, or those receiving care at different facilities. There was a low completion rate compared to the number of patients admitted during the time of the survey. As participation in the study was voluntary, the results of this study may be biased towards patients that were more interested in the topic, those with more time in the admission area, and those less distracted or concerned by the admission. Data about the characteristics of non-respondents was not available for comparison. Therefore, there may be alternative views of the target sample population that are not represented in the results of this study. As understanding patient preferences for communicating with health service providers through digital technologies is an emerging topic, a review to standardise terms is encouraged to enable future studies to be compared. Differentiating types of communication (e.g. email, website) from the devise used (e.g. mobile phone, laptop) would also allow for a greater understanding of preferencing among those who prefer using technology to communicate with the healthcare team. Future research should measure actual behaviours and reasons for choice in communication with hospitals post-hospital discharge if alternative technologies are made available. It should also consider understanding a broader range of reasons patients may have for contacting health service providers and patient characteristics that may be amenable to facilitating the adoption of technology in healthcare. Differences in technology availability and utilisation across different hospital facilities should also be investigated.",

The use of technology in health will continue to expand, but this study highlights the need for considering the needs and preferences of patients for communicating about their health needs. As health services continue to develop, the move away from a paternalistic system towards self-advocacy, empowerment, and quality is likely to see patients demand increased choice and control about how and when they communicate with healthcare providers [40] . Our study here highlights that acceptance of technology for communication about health is not pervasive, and that service development should also be informed by the needs and preferences of the patients they serve. In addition, these findings perhaps signal that most patients may prefer not to return to hospital for routine follow-up care if they have little or no concerns about their recovery. Health services with protocols requiring in-person follow-up care when recovery is progressing as planned should re-evaluate this practice.",

            "text": "This is the first study to evaluate for patient preferences for using ICTs to facilitate communication between patients and health service providers following their discharge from hospital. We found patients presenting for a planned admission to hospital use a variety of technologies to manage their daily activities and health. Patients also had preferences that varied depending on their concerns for communicating with the healthcare team posthospital discharge. It demonstrates that some, but not all, patients may prefer to use technology to traditional methods for communicating with the healthcare team post-hospital discharge. The majority of patients currently prefer more traditional methods for communication about symptoms post-hospital discharge (i.e., inperson or by telephone). Preferencing not to visit the hospital in-person is preferred when symptoms experienced are not of concern to a patient. These findings are important in the context of increased pressure to use technology to deliver healthcare efficiencies. These findings reinforce that health services should offer patients multiple options for communicating about their recovery to ensure individual needs are met appropriately. To fully realise the potential for greater service delivery efficiency and enhanced patient satisfaction with the healthcare experience that ICT may provide, health services looking to introduce new technologies to assist people with their symptom management should collaborate with patients to ensure such investments are warranted and adopted.",
