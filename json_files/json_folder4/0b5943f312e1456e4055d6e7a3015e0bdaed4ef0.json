            "text": "Background: Head and neck cancer patients often suffer from dysphagia after surgery and radiotherapy. A singing-enhanced swallowing protocol was established to improve their swallowing function. This study aimed to evaluate the beneficial effects of therapeutic singing on dysphagia in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. Methods: Patients who participated in this study were allocated to the intervention group (15 patients) and the control group (13 patients). Patients assigned to the intervention group received therapeutic singing 3 times per week for 4 weeks. Each group was divided into 2 subgroups, including the oral cavity cancer group and the pharyngeal cancer group. The patients' vocal functions were evaluated in maximum phonation time, pitch, intensity, jitter, shimmer, harmonics to noise ratio, and laryngeal diadochokinesis (L-DDK). To evaluate swallowing function, videofluoroscopic swallowing study was done, and the results were analyzed by videofluoroscopic dysphagia scale (VDS) and dynamic imaging grade of swallowing toxicity (DIGEST). Results: Among the voice parameters, L-DDK of the intervention group significantly increased compared to that of the control group. Swallowing functions of the intervention group were significantly improved in VDS and DIGEST after the intervention. Detailed items of VDS and DIGEST showed improvements especially in the pharyngeal phase score of VDS, such as laryngeal elevation, pharyngeal transit time, and aspiration. In addition, the pharyngeal cancer group showed significant improvements in VDS and DIGEST scores after the intervention. Conclusions: Our outcomes highlight the beneficial effects of singing for HNC patients with dysphagia. The notable improvements in the pharyngeal phase suggest that therapeutic singing would be more appropriate for HNC patients who need to improve their intrinsic muscle movements of vocal fold and laryngeal elevation.",

            "text": "Head and neck cancer (HNC) is classified as an epithelial malignancy that grows in the upper aerodigestive tract, including the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx. 1 Reportedly, there are more than 1,500,000 HNC patients worldwide, and approximately 900,000 deaths occur each year. 2 Although the causes of HNC remain unclear, 3 long-term survival has increased due to advances in medical technology, early detection, and treatment. 4 Treatments including surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy may often be performed depending on the characteristics of the tumor. As a consequence of treatments, swallowing difficulties have appeared as common symptoms in HNC patients and caused changes in swallowing mechanisms. 5 In surgical cases of HNC patients, the surgery often involves removing the healthy tissue and the musculoskeletal region surrounding the tumor and the tumor margin to secure a free margin. 6, 7 Oral and neck dissection may be performed simultaneously to remove the carcinoma in the head and neck region, which is characterized by a rapid lymph node metastasis. 8 When these operations are carried out, there is a high risk that the patients' anatomical structures classified as upper respiratory and digestive systems, such as oral, pharynx, and larynx, are inevitably defective and deformed. 9, 10 Radiotherapy is associated with pain, nausea, vomiting, mucositis, dry mouth, and muscle fibrosis, making it difficult to adapt to and recover from the disease and the treatment process. 11 In addition, psychological problems, including changes in body image and self-perception, depression, and anxiety, may occur due to the treatments for HNC. 12 Given the extensive impact of dysphagia on the morbidity of HNC patients, therapies to prevent, reduce, and alleviate swallowing difficulties are urgently needed. Most of them are related to respiratory-swallowing training based on a hierarchy of motor skill acquisition to encourage autonomous and optimal respiratory-swallowing coordination. 13 Although meta-analysis has presented the evidence that swallowing exercises are effective in the management of complications from the HNC treatment, 14 there are still many reports that HNC patients suffer from swallowing difficulties. 15, 16 To delay and reverse some of the devastating effects of cancer treatments, it is essential to ensure continued use of swallowing musculature by adherence to targeted vocal, respiration, and swallowing exercises for HNC patients. 13, 17 Based on the coordinative relation between respiration, vocalization, and oropharyngeal swallowing, singing can be an efficient therapeutic approach after cancer treatments. Both speech and singing rely on the tension on vocal cords resulting in modulations of the fundamental vocal frequency. 18 Singing a set of tones induces larynx elevations that contract several muscles, including an upper esophageal sphincter, to protect the airway against aspiration. [19] [20] [21] Within this context, singing can play a role in functional movement of swallowing, respiration, and vocalization.",

[22] [23] [24] Singing can improve oral motor functions related to articulation and breathing control. In other words, singing enhances the mobility and breathing functions of the facial and oral cavity muscles by inducing the coordination of vocalization organs and patterned breathing in the singing process. 25, 26 In addition, musical elements, such as rhythm, can support timed and controlled muscle movements with oral motor control, laryngeal elevation, and breathing during singing. Moreover, singing also offers additional benefits, including emotional arousal, reduced stress, and ease of self-administration for cancer survivors. 27 In this context, singing may be considered a beneficial intervention to improve the swallowing function of HNC patients, who need multi-faceted exercises to stimulate impaired anatomical structures accompanied by dysphagia. 28 Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic singing in HNC patients with dysphagia after surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.",

When the patient made the /i/ sound, suggestions were made to be conscious of the lip movement and maintain the lip and mouth shape. Changes in pitches are associated with the direction of vocal folds. Stretched vocal folds produce a higher pitch, and relaxed vocal folds make a lower pitch.

Data were analyzed using Praat, a motor speech software program that is a module of the Computerized Speech Lab model 5105. Maximum phonation time (MPT) and vocal intensity were collected. For MPT measurement, the patients were asked to produce the long vowel /a/ sound. This vocalization was measured 3 times, and the longest MPT was recorded. 31, 32 To measure changes in the patient's voice quality, the patient was instructed to speak the vowel /a/ as comfortably as possible. Among the measured intervals, a relatively stable 3-second period of time was analyzed to measure pitch, intensity, jitter, shimmer, and harmonics to noise ratio (HNR). To evaluate the range and the speed of vocal fold movement, each patient was asked to repeat the glottal syllable /a/ as quickly, consistently, and accurately as possible for 5 seconds.

Our protocol involved muscle exercises targeting the laryngeal elevation and the intrinsic muscle movement of swallowing. All HNC patients received the intervention after the primary cancer treatment.

Music application, such as singing in different pitches and breathing control with rhythmic cues, can stimulate muscles involved in swallowing from the activation of central and peripheral neural network. 22 During the intervention, singing with different pitches targets the intrinsic muscle movement of the vocal fold and the proper coordination of the muscle for laryngeal elevation when a patient makes a higher pitch sound. When vocalizing in different pitches, intensities generally change while showing different vibrations and strength through acoustic sound. In this study, HNC patients with dysphagia performed singing with different pitches, which requires vocal fold vibration, including the intrinsic muscle movement of the vocal fold and laryngeal movement in a structured musical behavior. When considering the swallowing difficulties and poor vocal functions in HNC patients with dysphagia, 15 patients with HNC need to enhance laryngeal elevation non-invasively and prevent aspiration by improving the intrinsic muscle movement of vocal folds.",
