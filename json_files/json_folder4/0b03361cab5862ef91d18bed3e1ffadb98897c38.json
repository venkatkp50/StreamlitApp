            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the reorganisation of healthcare services to limit the transmission of the virus and deal with the sequelae of infection. This reorganisation had a detrimental effect on cardiovascular services, with reductions in hospitalisations for acute cardiovascular events and the deferral of all but the most urgent interventional procedures and operations. [1, 2] Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common form of valvular heart disease. Once stenosis is severe, symptoms follow and the prognosis is poor, with 50% mortality within two years of symptom onset. [3] Thus, timely treatment is of paramount importance. Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) has historically been the default treatment strategy. However, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has recently emerged as an effective and increasingly utilised option across operative risk strata. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] There was a large decline in TAVI and SAVR procedural activity to treat severe AS during the COVID-19 pandemic. [9] Between the period March to November 2020, it is estimated that the decrease in activity accounted for 4989 (95% CI. 4020-5959) patients in England with severe AS left untreated by TAVI or SAVR. [9] As we move into an era of 'living with' COVID-19, plans must urgently be put in place to best manage the additional waiting list burden for treatment of severe AS. [10] In this study, we used mathematical methods to examine the extent to which additional capacity to provide treatment of severe AS should be created to clear the backlog and minimise deaths of people on the waiting list.",

[9] In the absence of contemporaneous data on waiting lists and SAVR and TAVI activity, we have taken this number as the excess backlog on which to model solutions. The incidence of AS has not increased over recent years. [11] Therefore, we assumed that the system was in a steady state before the COVID-19 pandemic and without loss of generality defined the steady-state waiting list to be zero. Additionally, we assumed that the normal rate of flow ( ) of new patients into the waiting list for treatment of severe AS would be maintained upon the commencement of additional operations. Thus, the extra capacity that we model is to clear the excess post-COVID-19 backlog.",

[12] More recent studies have estimated the one-year mortality to be 51% [5] and 55%, but these included cohorts that were considered inappropriate for SAVR, thus, we considered these estimates unrepresentative of an unselected population with severe AS. [13] The routine capacity for treatment of severe AS was taken from the pre-pandemic period. In 2018/19, the NHS in England performed 7830 SAVR ( = 7830) and 5197 TAVI ( = 5197) procedures, for a total throughput of about 13,000 per year. [14] Modelling Patients on the waiting list for treatment of severe AS were represented as a dynamical system (figure 1). To this model, we introduce capacity in surplus to the 2018/19 performance and call this capacity (further details are provided in supplementary material). We assume that the typical caseload for which the NHS in England can deal with continues; therefore, the backlog is only reduced by treating patients with this extra capacity or by patient mortality before receiving treatment. We also consider patients in the backlog and patients new to the waiting list indistinguishable. Thus, the waiting list size represents the excess number of people seeking treatment who are unable to be treated immediately at any one time. We also assume that other paths out of the waiting list (i.e. patients seeking private treatment) would be so small in comparison to the uncertainty estimates as to be negligible on the results of our analysis.",

During the COVID-19 pandemic, TAVI was performed in patients usually referred for surgery, with no difference in short term outcomes compared to historical reference groups. [15, 16] We assumed that the duration of a SAVR would routinely be between 2-4 hours and a TAVI between 1-2 hours.

[19] Several clinical factors may favour SAVR over TAVI (including concomitant severe coronary artery disease, low STS score, bicuspid aortic valve etc.); therefore, we assumed that, in the short term, no more than 50% of patients could be converted from SAVR to TAVI. [20] We also assumed that no more than 50% extra capacity could be created by other means (e.g. extra lists, more procedures per list).

Mortality on the waiting list is less responsive to our modelled interventions than the time to clear the backlog (the darker coloured regions of figure 3d make up a greater proportion of the estimates than those of figure 3c). Increasing capacity within the system alongside converting a proportion of SAVR cases to TAVI provides the greatest benefit in clearing the backlog and avoiding associated mortality. A combination that would result in the clearance of the backlog within a year might be of interest for decision makers. With the conversion of 40% of SAVR operations to TAVI and creation of an additional 20% capacity, we estimate the backlog would be cleared in just under a year -343 days (95% CI, 281-410) with 784 (95% CI, 292-1324) deaths before treatment. Sensitivity analyses where the number of TAVI procedures that could be completed within the same time as SAVR was altered (TAVI to SAVR: 4 to 3, 4 to 2, 5 to 3) support these findings (supplementary material figures S1 -S3). Furthermore, sensitivity analyses show that with the best-in-class practices (TAVI to SAVR: 4 to 2), even a more modest combination (a conversion of 35% and creation of an additional 10% capacity) would be enough to clear the backlog within a year. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint",

Second, we have not attempted to calculate how many AS patients may have died in the COVID-19 pandemic. Third, our assumed mortality rate may differ at a centre-level due to prioritising clinically more vulnerable patients on the waiting list. Fourth, a centre-level analysis could account for the different practices in each treatment centre and identify strategies that work best for each centre. Fifth, our estimates from converting cases from SAVR to TAVI does not include post-procedural factors such as the requirement for intensive care capacity, hospital stay and further procedures because these rely on multiple centre-specific factors. Finally, it has been shown that rapid growth in the demand for TAVI can overwhelm current capacity, [22] which may lead to prolonged wait times and subsequent adverse outcomes while patients are on the waitlist.

Severe AS is a progressive condition with valve replacement the only available treatment improving prognosis. [24] On a local, regional, and national scale, healthcare systems will need to examine capacity, set priorities, and plan for adequate capacity to manage the backlog of patients with severe AS. The response will be complicated by prior exhaustion of human resources from the pandemic and competition with other specialities, which will also have backlogs. [25] Nonetheless, planning should prioritise patients at the highest risk from a deferral of treatment. Mortality on the waiting list for AS has been reported to be as high as 14%. [26] Furthermore, patients awaiting structural procedures deferred due to the pandemic have been found to have significantly higher mortality rates compared to those with stable coronary artery disease. [27] Prioritising capacity for treatment of patients with severe AS may mean reduced capacity for other procedures. This interaction will require collaborative decisionmaking on a local level accepting that these are difficult, imperfect times. We also show that the conversion of a proportion of cases that would usually be managed by SAVR to TAVI can help expedite treatment and reduce mortality on the waiting list. During the pandemic, TAVI procedures were performed in patients usually referred for surgery with no apparent difference in short term outcomes; [15, 16] and data continues to emerge for longer-term efficacy and safety of TAVI across operative risk strata. [28, 29] Recent European guidelines suggest that TAVI would be a preferable option for patients over 75 years of age compared to SAVR. [20] To help planning, we provide an app (https://github.com/Christian-P-Stickels/AS_Waitinglist_data) to explore the impact of alterations in capacity and treatment pathways on waiting lists and mortality related to severe AS at a local, regional and national level (supplementary material).",

It is only in cases where the identification rate is less than the treatment rate that this assumption becomes invalid. In such cases, can be said to be equal to the identification rate instead. This is true because mortality is not tied to being on the waiting list but from the onset of symptoms.

In total, the operational changes and conversion create an extra capacity of 3232 operations with which to service the waiting list each year: 1822 (1,039+522+261) TAVI and 1410 (1,566-156) SAVR operations.",

            "text": "The effect of converting SAVR to TAVI The conversion of a proportion of cases from surgery to TAVI provides a modest improvement in estimates of time to clear the backlog and mortality on the waiting list. With the conversion of 30% of SAVR operations to TAVI procedures, without the creation of additional capacity in the system, we estimate it would take 975 (95% CI, 741-1284) days to clear the backlog and result in 1914 (95% CI, 923-2809) deaths on the waiting list. Even with the conversion of 50% of SAVR operations to TAVI procedures, we estimate the backlog would be cleared within 666 (95% CI, 533-848) days with 1419 (95% CI, 597-2189) deaths.Combining conversion of SAVR to TAVI and additional capacityFigures 3a and 3bdemonstrate the range of possibilities in creating extra capacity. Each line demonstrates a range of intervention strategies that provide the same result. For example, to reduce mean predicted deaths to 1000 people (red line figure 3b), centres could increase capacity to provide an extra 25% procedures per week at the same mix as pre-pandemic, or they could convert 50% of SAVR operations to TAVI and increase capacity by 8.7% at that mix.Figures 3c and 3drepresent how the combinations of interventions to increase capacity within the system alongside the conversion of SAVR to TAVI would impact the time to clear",

The x-axis is truncated at 5% for visualisation and clarity.We find that error in the one-year mortality causes higher uncertainty at lower capacity increases, but at higher capacity increases, this uncertainty decreases until it is almost zero with regards to clearance time. This is likely because at higher capacity increases, more of our waiting list clearance comes from treatment, as opposed to death, resulting in less error.",
