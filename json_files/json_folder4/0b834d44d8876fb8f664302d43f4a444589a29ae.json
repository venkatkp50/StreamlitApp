In the short term, preliminary World Health Organization (WHO) guidance advises that NTD surveys, active case detection activities, and mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns should be postponed, while support for prompt diagnosis, treatment, and essential vector control should continue where possible [1]. The impact of program disruptions on the hard-won gains of reduced infection, morbidity, and mortality, and therefore on elimination timelines, is uncertain. Mathematical modelling, such as that carried out by the NTD Modelling Consortium, can provide quantitative insights on how NTD programs could be impacted by the delays while showing potential catch-up strategies to mitigate impacts (ntdmodelling.org/covidinterruption.pdf). These models suggest that the impact on some NTDs can be mitigated in the years to come, provided the delay is minimal and that prompt remedial (and in some cases novel) action is taken.",

The resulting rate of resurgence in prevalence depends on the rate at which new infections occur, which is driven by the natural histories of the disease and the local transmission conditions. The resurgence rates for many NTDs are relatively slow, particularly when compared with other infectious diseases, such as measles and malaria, meaning that the impact of a short disruption to",

            "text": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic will have wide-reaching implications for health systems and programs, including among populations in whom neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are endemic. In the short term, preliminary World Health Organization (WHO) guidance advises that NTD surveys, active case detection activities, and mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns should be postponed, while support for prompt diagnosis, treatment, and essential vector control should continue where possible [1] . The impact of program disruptions on the hard-won gains of reduced infection, morbidity, and mortality, and therefore on elimination timelines, is uncertain. Mathematical modelling, such as that carried out by the NTD Modelling Consortium, can provide quantitative insights on how NTD programs could be impacted by the delays while showing potential catch-up strategies to mitigate impacts (ntdmodelling.org/covidinterruption.pdf). These models suggest that the impact on some NTDs can be mitigated in the years to come, provided the delay is minimal and that prompt remedial (and in some cases novel) action is taken. During a disruption to interventions, the transmission of infectious diseases will gradually rise back towards the preintervention level unless interventions are reintroduced. The resulting rate of resurgence in prevalence depends on the rate at which new infections occur, which is driven by the natural histories of the disease and the local transmission conditions. The resurgence rates for many NTDs are relatively slow, particularly when compared with other infectious diseases, such as measles and malaria, meaning that the impact of a short disruption to NTD programs will accrue gradually. High-transmission areas face the greatest risk as resurgence will be faster in these areas. Additionally, the longer the delay of interventions, the greater the resurgence, and therefore the greater the rate of new infections. Once reintroduced, programs could consider intensifying the coverage or frequency of interventions, if politically and economically feasible, to mitigate the effects of the disruption.",

            "text": "For the NTDs managed via MDA campaigns, the impact of delaying MDA will vary across diseases. For the helminth infections, the resurgence rate following a round of MDA is driven by the local transmission rate and the lifespan of the adult worm. Shorter-lived worms will have higher resurgence because resurgence rates are approximately proportional to 1/L, where L is the lifespan of the worm in the human host [2] . Hence, missing an annual MDA for soil-transmitted helminthiases (STH) and schistosomiasis programs (lifespans from 1 to 10 years [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] ) will be more severe than for onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis (LF) (lifespans from 5 to 15 years [8, 9] ) ( Figure 1 ) (but unlike LF, onchocerciasis MDA treatments are not strongly adulticidal [10] ). Similar analysis for trachoma estimated that the doubling time (time over which the number of cases double) for resurgence may vary from 1-2 months in highly endemic settings to 4-8 months in lower endemic settings [11] , suggesting that trachoma programs face a greater resurgence risk relative to the helminths. The risk of trachoma resurgence will be greatest in high-prevalence settings, where a 1-year delay may extend elimination timelines by 2-3 years.",

This is due to uncertainties in the natural history of infection and, more importantly, because changes in the number of newly diagnosed cases are a consequence not only of new infections but also of how rapidly they are detected. Therefore, disruptions due to COVID-19 are likely to lead to fewer cases being detected, while the underlying rate of new infections increases. Where this happens, detections of outbreaks may be delayed, posing a challenge to health system responses. For visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in the Indian subcontinent, halting programs for 1 year likely causes incidence to revert to the rate occurring 1 year earlier, if the program is currently in the attack phase (ie, undertaking intense control measures). For settings that are already below the target incidence (<1 per 10 000 annually [12] ) with less-intense measures, the setback could be up to 5 years, leading to an incidence above the elimination target in previously highly endemic settings. Local outbreaks may also be possible. For the gambiense form of human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT), incidence is likely to continue to decline if the disruption only lasts for 1 year but may increase in the second year of disruption, especially if diagnosis and treatment of cases presenting at health facilities are disrupted; modelling suggests transmission temporarily increased in Mandoul, Chad, during a 2-year screening break in 2007-2008 [13] .",

While it is unlikely that new vector-control activities can be introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic, continuation of existing measures may help, as evident during program disruptions due to the West African Ebola outbreak in Guinea, where areas with vector control saw fewer gHAT cases after normal activities resumed [14] . For VL, the effect of suspending indoor residual spraying efforts should be expected to be more variable at local village levels, ranging from very limited impact to outbreaks as observed in Kosra, India [15, 16] . For LF, the use of bednets has a small impact relative to MDA and, in addition, bednets will not be effective in areas where the predominant vector species bites during the day [17, 18] .",

Once NTD programs are able to resume, many financial and human resources will be constrained, hindering business-as-usual. However, targeting of catch-up strategies should be informed by up-to-date data, rather than implementing standard disease-specific interventions. Re-surveying areas once programs are resumed will also allow for empirical validation of model-based predictions.
