In this paper, we discuss the interaction of credit financing and channel encroachment in a dual-channel supply chain structure consisting of a supplier and a retailer. Under the Stackelberg structure, we observe the interaction between credit financing and channel encroachment is heavily dependent on the substitution degree, potential online market, and production cost. Intuitively, the supplier is more likely to choose trade credit financing, except in the case where both the potential online market, substitution degree, and production cost are small; under these conditions, bank credit financing may be an equilibrium strategy. As long as the production cost is below a certain threshold, the supplier will choose the trade credit financing strategy.",

Thus, improving capital flow from the perspective of the supply chain system effectively promotes supply chain development. Reasonable use of supply chain finance can not only significantly alleviate the financial pressure faced by small-and medium-sized enterprises (Bernabucci 2008) , but also enhance trade relationships and strengthen competitive advantage (Seifert and Seifert 2011) . For example, to relieve the upstream financial pressure, Wal-Mart, the largest supermarket, facilitated their cooperators' access to bank loans as bank credit financing; furthermore, Wal-Mart also offered finance directly to upstream firms in the form of trade credit financing (e.g., paying an early discount scheme, sharing suppliers' inventory costs). After more than 20 years of rapid development, supply chain finance plays a significant role in alleviating capital shortages and optimizing capital flows (Ding and Wan 2020; Li et al. 2019) .",

            "text": "However, because of the accelerated effect of the Internet on the global economy, the development of supply chain finance is facing an important challenge. In the e-commerce age, suppliers (e.g., Apple and Nike) can offer products via retailers or online platforms, which causes competition to arise between the upstream supplier and retail partners (Zhang et al. 2019a, b, c) . In addition to this, a noted phenomenon is that retailers can open their own direct-to-consumer online platforms to compete with the supplier's online sales if their advantage disappears because of the adverse impact of channel conflict. How the retailer encroaches on the direct channel and how supply chain management will be affected are significant questions. In addition, the supplier's wholesale price and direct price are influenced by the choice of credit financing, which further impacts whether the retailer encroaches on the online market and determines pricing decisions. Therefore, platform encroachment makes the original problem of financing choice more complex.",

            "text": "The interaction between credit financing and channel encroachment is particularly significant in the freight forwarding market. Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in early 2020, the container liner market has undergone a sharp change from low to high . Especially during the fourth quarter of 2020, the market experienced tight space and a shortage of empty containers, which led to a dramatic increase in the prices of the container international shipping. Hence, the freight forwarding market is facing a series of problems for freighters, such as capital shortage caused by huge advance payments and lack of financing channels, restricting its development. Besides, freighters also face the dilemma of shipping companies seizing a large market share through channel encroachment, e.g., Maersk launched a new online booking platform (ship.maerskline.com) in 2017. Under these conditions, many small-and medium-sized enterprises have considered adopting the credit financing strategy. It is these findings that inspire us to study the interaction between channel encroachment and credit financing.",

Depending on which kind of credit financing is considered, two strategies are described. When financing is sourced from a bank, it is known as bank credit financing (BCF strategy) which mainly focuses on the perspective of coordination contracts (Ding and Wan 2020; Shi et al. 2020) , inventory decisions (Chakuu et al. 2020; Li et al. 2020a, b; He et al. 2020) , information sharing Sang 2021) , etc. For the BCF strategy, Zhou et al. (2020) explored the equilibrium of guarantor financing for retailers who can borrow bank credit in a four-stage supply chain structure. When the source of financing is the retailer, it is known as trade credit financing (TCF strategy) which mainly focuses on the perspective of product quality (Lee and Stowe 1993; Long et al. 1993) , inventory decisions (Gupta and Wang 2009; Haley and Higgins 1973; Luo and Shang 2019) , and moral hazard (Babich and Tang 2004; Kim and Shin 2012; Rui and Lai 2015) . For the TCF strategy, Wu et al. (2018) introduced two unbalanced retailers into trade credit financing to reveal the influence of initial capital and exogenous price on interest rates. On this basis, Deng et al. (2021) extended the existing research to investigate the influence of trade credit financing on vertical and horizontal competition with multiple downstream firms. However, the existing literature only examines the options in bank credit financing or trade credit financing. This encourages us to explore the equilibrium solution and corresponding conditions between the two financing strategies.",

Along these lines, Kouvelis and Zhao (2012) constructed the early payment discount scheme to decide the wholesale price when paying early or the interest rates when delaying payment, and found that the downstream firms preferred trade financing to bank financing. On this basis, Deng et al. (2018) derived the equilibriums for different financing scenarios to indicate the influence of initial capital and production cost on interest rate and corresponding conditions. Additionally, Chod (2017) investigated the combination of bank financing and trade financing to find an optimal way to make the downstream firms lower the loan and inventory quantities. Furthermore, Yang and Birge (2018) captured the relationships between the operations decision, capital constraint, and financing scenario to analyze the influence of risk-sharing on supply chain performance. Meanwhile, Zhen et al. (2020) found the upstream equilibrium of financing strategy to explore how the creditors' interest rate influences operations management in a dualchannel structure. Furthermore, many scholars compared the performances of bank credit financing and trade credit financing from risk tolerance An et al. 2021) , integrating sourcing (Tang and Li 2020; Yoo et al. 2021) , game structure (Yan et al. 2020; Ding and Wan, 2020) , and integrating inventory (Fu et al. 2020; Li et al. 2021) . However, the upstream strategy affects the downstream equilibrium; no previous studies have examined the case of channel encroachment in credit financing. Therefore, our research examines the interactions between financing strategy and channel encroachment in the dual-channel supply chain to obtain managerial insights.",

Intuitively, the majority of scholars examine upstream encroachment which often hurts the downstream firms because the original market share is divided up. Liu et al. (2016) provided an opposite observation, that channel encroachment may be disadvantageous to the upstream firms if the downstream firms have strong fairness concerns. Yan et al. (2018) explored the influences of product durability on the strategies of channel encroachment under the oligopoly market structure, and found that both members benefited from channel encroachment if the product durability is at a threshold level. On this basis, Li et al. (2020a, b) illustrated the interactions between channel encroachment and retail inventory under the scenarios of centralization and decentralization. In addition, for multiple downstream firms, Guan et al. (2019) analyzed the relationship between channel encroachment and retail inventory to find that each member could obtain more profit for retail competition. Further, some studies also focus on the interaction between chain competition and upstream encroachment (Li et al. 2015) . However, unlike in this study, existing studies mainly investigate upstream encroachment, while ignoring the case where the retailer also encroaches on the online channel in a dual-channel supply chain structure.",

Under this situation, the supplier can provide products to the retailer at an endogenous wholesale price w and production cost c, and the retailer, in turn, sells to the consumer at a retail price p. Beyond that, the supplier can sell through an online platform at the direct price d. This setting focuses on a point where both the supplier and retailer are potential sellers. To deal with the shared market, the retailer considers whether to encroach on the online market at a booking price b. Without loss of generality, we can normalize the potential demand to 1 (Nalca 2017; Niu et al. 2020) . Based on the assumption that the demand mainly depends on price, we construct the linear-price demand functions to analyze this problem (Deo and Corbett 2009; Shen et al. 2018; Zhen et al. 2020 ). Similar to Singh and Vives (1984) and Li et al. (2020a, b) , we assume the utilitybased function of representative consumers is U q s , q r , d r = s q s + q r + r d r \u2212 1 2 q 2 s \u2212 2 2 q 2 r \u2212 3 2 d 2 r \u2212 q s q r + q s d r + q r d r , and derive each channel's demand function. More specifically, we assume that the market share can be divided into an online part and offline part, where s + r = 1 . Further, for simplification, the total online demand is considered a.

From the above analysis, we observe that the interest rate plays an important role in the optimal pricing decisions. Specifically, the encroachment results in a low direct price and wholesale price, thus leading to a decrease in retail price and booking price (e.g., w BN > w BE , d BN > d BE , and p BN > p BE ).

Interestingly, the optimal decision of interest rate is a significant factor that affects the retailer's strategy, wherein we find that the bank's interest rate if encroachment occurs is obviously lower than that in the non-encroachment case (e.g., I BN > I BE ). When other conditions are unchanged, with the improvement of interest rate, the supplier correspondingly increases the direct price and wholesale price, which indirectly reduces the retailer's profit when she refuses to encroach. However, channel encroachment effectively prevents this situation; the reason is the retailer entering online market directly shocks the original share of supplier and forces to lower direct price and wholesale price.

Figure 2 shows a visual representation of above analysis. Intuitively, the supplier is more likely to choose TCF; however, in the case where the potential online market, substitution degree, and production are simultaneously small, BCF-E may serve as an equilibrium strategy. The retailer is both the seller and creditor, which causes a disadvantage for the supplier; otherwise, compared with the BCF strategy, the retailer sets the pricing decision by considering the impact of individual behaviors on the upstream supply chain. Recall from Lemma 1 and Lemma 2 that we observe that the thresholds in Fig. 2 provide the equilibrium strategy of credit financing. We use colorless and colored areas to represent the BCF strategy and TCF strategy, respectively, in which the colored part is divided into the cases of encroachment and non-encroachment. As shown in Fig. 2 , as long as the production cost remains below a threshold, the supplier never chooses the BCF strategy. When the production cost increases to a threshold, the probability of the supplier choosing BCF may increase. In addition, the larger the substitution, the smaller the values of a 1 and a 2 .",

As the leader, the supplier has two options, namely BCF or TCF. Correspondingly, the retailer, as the follower, determines whether to encroach or not. Our analysis provides the following managerial insights. First, for suppliers with capital shortage, the interaction between credit financing and channel encroachment is heavily dependent on the substitution degree, potential online market, and production cost. When the cost is high or the online market share exceeds a threshold, the supplier prefers to choose TCF. Further, when BCF is considered, the retailer definitely encroaches; otherwise, whether to encroach or not mainly depends on the production cost. As the production cost increases, the retailer tends to only operate the existing channel. Finally, regardless of the form of credit financing that the supplier chooses, when the retailer encroaches, the interest rate decreases.",
