The Hei-Connect stir plate uses a built-in proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller to adjust the temperature. This controller has two modes, namely, precise-mode, which avoids an overshoot in the sample temperature, and fast-mode, in which the heater will heat rapidly but in our testing the overshoot could be as large as 15 \u00b0C. We chose to use the stir plate's precise-mode in our program, and in addition to this built-in control, we added the functionality that any pumps that are pumping will be paused whenever the measured temperature of the oil bath is out of a user-defined acceptable temperature range. After the pumps pause, the program will wait for the temperature to return to a different defined range of the set temperature plus or minus one. By setting two temperature ranges, one for pausing pumps (\u00b15 \u00b0C) and the other for resuming pumps (\u00b11 \u00b0C), the pumps do not rapidly switch on and off when the temperature is at the edge of the user set temperature range. This approach results in a reliable temperature and more precise pumping times. In addition to the temperature adjustment functionality, another highlight of the program is the ability for users to pause the pumps whenever they are pumping. The pause functionality was vital during the developmental stage of the chemical process; it allowed a chemist user much flexibility in modifying the process. ",

Schematic drawing for the cleaning protocol between each molecule synthesis implementation.9. Analysis of the feasibility of synthesizing top-selling drugs using SPS-flow technologyUpon close analysis of the top 200 small-molecule pharmaceuticals (by retail sales in 2018), we envision that 73 out of 155 single small molecules (among the top 200 pharmaceuticals, 39 are mixtures of molecules and 6 are feedstock compounds) possess functional group handles suitable for attachment to solid supports, 28 molecules can be achieved by cyclization-cleavage or substitution-cleavage strategies, and 12 molecules can potentially be approached through SPS assisted by a traceless linker. Taken together, 73% of these single pharmaceutical molecules can potentially be synthesized by SPS:",
