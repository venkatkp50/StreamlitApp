Clinically occult SARS-CoV-2 infection among patients admitted to the hospital is always considered a risk during the pandemic. The aim of our study is to describe the application of CT scan to reveal unexpected COVID-19 in patients needing hospital admission. Method In our emergency department, we prospectively enrolled adult patients needing hospital admission, without symptoms suspected of COVID-19, and showing negative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) swab test. CT scan was performed to diagnose clinically occult COVID-19 pneumonia. All the exams were read and discussed retrospectively by two expert radiologists and assigned to one of 4 exclusive diagnoses: typical (typCT), indeterminate (indCT), atypical (atyCT), negative (negCT). The clinical characteristics and final diagnoses were described and compared with the results of CT scans. Results From May 25 to August 18, 2020, we prospectively enrolled 197 patients. They showed 122 negCT, 52 atyCT, 22 indCT, and 1 typCT. Based on the CT imaging, the prevalence of suspected clinically occult COVID-19 pneumonia was 11.6% (23 patients). None had confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection after the hospital stay. Nineteen patients had negative serial RT-PCR while in 4 cases, the infection was excluded by clinical follow-up or appearance of positivity of RT-PCR after months. Conclusion Our descriptive analysis confirms that CT scan cannot be considered a valid tool to screen clinically occult COVID-19, when the asymptomatic patients need hospitalization for other conditions. Application of personnel protections and distancing among patients remains the best strategies to limit the possibility of intrahospital cross-infections.",

            "text": "The bursting of COVID-19 pandemic is challenging the health systems around the world, both in scarce-resource areas and even in the most advanced and rich countries. One of the major challenges posed by the pandemic is the management of the surge of admissions, at the same time isolating infected patients to limit in-hospital crossinfections. The first diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in suspected patients is based on the confirmation by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) nasopharyngeal swab test and visualization of pneumonia by chest imaging, including lung ultrasound and CT scan [1] [2] [3] . From the beginning of the first pandemic surge characterized by an extremely high prevalence of infections, it became evident that the sensitivity of the RT-PCR was not sufficient to avoid a significant number of false negative cases [4] . In patients with clear symptoms raising suspicion, the process for the first diagnosis of COVID-19 is improved by a systematic combination of clinical assessment, bedside lung ultrasound or CT scan, and RT-PCR [3] . In some cases, only serial repetitions of the RT-PCR swab during the hospital stay may reveal initial false negative results. However, it is largely demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 may give asymptomatic infection in a significant percentage of cases. Thus, in patients admitted to the hospital who do not present with symptoms suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection, there is the possibility of asymptomatic infection. For this reason, during the pandemic, there is the necessity to exclude asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 in patients admitted to the hospital for other pathologies, to isolate unexpected new cases and limit the danger of cross-infections. In the recent literature, it was demonstrated that CT scan imaging may be useful to reveal signs of the typical SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in patients without symptoms and negative RT-PCR [5] .",

The calculated total cost of CT Table 1 , we report the correspondence between the CT readings, the motivations supporting the status concerning COVID-19 infection at admission and discharge, and the final clinical diagnoses. No patient resulted affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection. In 19 cases, the RT-PCR repeated serially during the hospital stay confirmed the first negativity obtained result in the ED. In 3 cases, the negativity to COVID-19 was also corroborated by the appearance of positivity of the RT-PCR with a new hospital admission after months from the enrollment. In one case, the patient was discharged quickly without repetition of swab tests, but COVID-19 was then excluded because the patient became positive to SARS-CoV-2 and admitted for related pneumonia after months.

This is particularly valid in a moment of decrease of the prevalence of the infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our geographic area was first hit by the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak during spring 2020. At that time, our institution identified emergent priorities for the surge of admissions. The priorities included, among others, the need for protecting patients and personnel from the risk of crossinfections inside the hospital. For this reason, it was decided to secure adequate supply of personnel protective equipment and institute separated areas inside the hospital for patients with and without COVID-19 active infection. These areas included beds dedicated both to patients needing intensive or emergency care and to patients needing low-intensity care. Due to the known sub-optimal sensitivity of the first RT-PCR testing and delay in obtaining the laboratory result, our group experienced a strategy based on a combination of lung ultrasound and clinical evaluation to guide a safe initial allocation of patients suspected of COVID-19 [8, 9] . The protocol was then validated by an international multicenter study [3] . Based on that experience, we reiterate here that chest imaging needs to be integrated with the clinical condition and presenting symptoms to allow an accurate diagnostic process. After the first allocation in the ED, in cases that remain doubtful, serial repetition of RT-PCR together with extension of chest imaging to CT scan allow completion of the diagnostic process to guide admission of the patients to dedicated COVID or non-COVID areas [3] . During the outbreak waves, the number of alternative pathologies needing hospital admission dramatically fell to a minimum that was never experienced in the past, and almost all the available beds became dedicated to COVID-19 patients. Fig. 4 CT scan of one patient without symptoms of COVID-19 and negative RT-PCR swab test. The scan shows mono-lateral ground glass areas (red arrows) and was interpreted as Indeterminate for COVID-19 interstitial pneumonia, thus raising suspicion of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patient was admitted into a gray area of the hospital dedicated to suspected COVID-19, with a main diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia. During the hospital stay the RT-PCR resulted repeatedly negative and the patient was again admitted to the hospital after some months for COVID-19 pneumonia, this time with positive RT-PCR However, during these last 2 years, it became evident that the pandemic may manifest with highly variable prevalence [10] . After the first dramatic wave, our institution experienced a fall in the prevalence of COVID-19 and an increase in the number of alternative pathologies needing admissions. Progressively, the COVID-19-dedicated beds were converted to general use, with a growing need to limit the risk of subclinical COVID-19 cases admitted in COVID-19-free areas. To this aim, in our institution, it was deliberated the implementation of a diagnostic algorithm based on the evaluation by CT scan to diagnose clinically occult COVID-19 pneumonia [5] . This algorithm was applied to any patient over 50 years old who needed admission from the ED for any diagnosis alternative to COVID-19 and showing negative RT-PCR tests. The protocol was approved and applied during the period of our analysis; after 3 months of application, our analysis demonstrates its failure.",

            "text": "One of the main objective reasons of failure is the variability in the prevalence of COVID-19. This variability strongly affects the diagnostic accuracy of RT-PCR and chest imaging, the two main diagnostic tools in the management of COVID-19 [4, 11] . For example, during the peak of the surge, the probability that a positive RT-PCR assay is effectively linked to the SARS-CoV-2 infection is extremely high and negativity of the test will have not enough power to exclude, while the opposite happens when the prevalence of the infection drops down. Thus, a negative RT-PCR during a fall in the prevalence is far more sensitive in excluding than during the peak of the surge. The same can be said for chest imaging. In a moment of high prevalence, signs of interstitial pneumonia become highly specific, while they fail in ruling-in COVID-19 pneumonia when the prevalence approaches 0 cases and differential diagnoses become more probable. Moreover, chest imaging can only diagnose the pulmonary involvement during the time course of the disease but cannot be of any help in Table 1 Correspondence between CT scan readings and clinical diagnoses in 23 patients without symptoms of COVID-19 and negative RT-PCR nasal-pharyngeal swab test, needing hospital admission. The columns report: CT scan results, definitive diagnosis about the sta-tus of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the hospital stay (assigned after follow-up) with main motivation, final clinical diagnosis, dedicated areas inside the hospital where the patients were admitted and then discharged CT, computerized tomography of the chest; COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 diagnosing the infection not complicated by pneumonia. Thus, the usefulness of CT scan when used to diagnose COVID-19 is strongly limited [11, 12] . Finally, following the Bayesian reasoning, the accuracy of any diagnostic test fails when applied to patients without clinical suspicion. Thus, like for any other test, CT scan simply loses specificity in diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia when applied to patients without symptoms of the disease [13] .",

Based on doubtful imaging obtained during our study, some patients were allocated in COVID-19 areas, even if sometimes in protected beds, but then revealed not infected. Moreover, our observation is limited by the fact that the algorithm was applied in a moment of fall in the prevalence when the probability of false negative RT-PCR became extremely low. It is not said that, during a rise in the prevalence, the percentage of false negative swabs might become significantly higher. In these cases, CT imaging may be of help in finding clinically occult COVID-19 pneumonia but cannot help in diagnosing those cases without pulmonary involvement. For all these reasons, more than relying on a strict selection in the ED of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients for admissions in separated areas, it is safer considering any patient and personnel a possible source of infection. We speculate that a general strategy based on reinforcement of bed distancing, personnel equipping, and strict monitoring of patients with negative RT-PCR tests inside the areas dedicated to alternative COVID-19 pathologies remains a more efficient and safer alternative.",
