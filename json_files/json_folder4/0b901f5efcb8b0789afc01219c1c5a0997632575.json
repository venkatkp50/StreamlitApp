A Systematic Review on Lean Applications' in Emergency Departments. Healthcare 2021, 9, 763. https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare 9060763 Academic Editors: Giovanni Improta, Abstract: This article presents the state of the art of Lean principles applied in Emergency Departments through a systematic literature review. Our article extends previous work found in the literature to respond to the following questions: (i) What research problems in emergency departments can Lean principles help overcome? (ii) What Lean approaches and tools are used most often in this environment? (iii) What are the results and benefits obtained by these practices? and (iv) What research opportunities appear as gaps in the current state of the art on the subject? A six-step systematic review was performed following the guidance of the PRISMA method. The review analysis identified six main research problems where Lean was applied in Emergency Departments: (i) High Waiting Time and High Length of Hospital Stay; (ii) Health Safety; (iii) Process redesign; (iv) Management and Lessons Learned; (v) High Patient Flow; (vi) Cost Analysis. The six research problems' main approaches identified were Lean Thinking, Multidisciplinary, Statistics, and Six Sigma. The leading Lean tools and methodologies were VSM, Teamwork, DMAIC, and Kaizen.",

Finally, this study identifies knowledge gaps and new opportunities to study Lean best practices in healthcare organizations.",

Because these departments are complex systems, there is no default template to improve performance [1] . It is common to see overcrowding and workloads that exceed the availability of resources [2] , which results in high waiting times, delays in acute treatments, and increased lengths of hospital stays [3] . These issues impact the quality of care and clinical outcomes, increasing the rate of adverse events and hospital mortality [4] . The challenge for healthcare companies is to find appropriate management solutions that improve efficiency, productivity, and quality of performance [3] . In this context, hospital costs and patient and worker satisfaction are affected [5, 6] .",

            "text": "Implementation of Lean principles in healthcare can improve care capacity by as much as 30% and reduce patient waiting time by 50% [16] . However, the interaction between working groups with Lean is variable [17] , which indicates that the successful implementation of Lean depends on the leaders' commitment. Other elements for the success of Lean methodology in an ED is the ability to change, developing a clear mapping of processes and the introduction of small improvements that are sustainable in the long term [3] . In complex environments such as health, it is vital to combine Lean's continuous improvement with innovative practices to strengthen the implementation of improvement projects [15] . More rigorous studies are needed to determine Lean benefits in healthcare [18, 19] , including those focused on the implementation process, which can serve as a roadmap for new applications. The management tools applied to healthcare processes are difficult to implement due to absence of standardization and repeatable indicators to measure the quality of care [20] . Otherwise, Ref. [21] points out that a limited number of studies address shortcomings in the ED, but a growing trend utilizes hybrid methods that involve simulation, Lean techniques, and quality improvement. The use of an integrated methodology is desirable because Lean methodology is very suitable for increasing the effectiveness of the process, while Six Sigma tools increase the efficiency of the process [11] . There are studies that apply Six Sigma DMAIC methodology [11, 22] and Lean Six Sigma management tools [20] , which indicate improvement of healthcare performance after implementation. The integrated use of both methodologies for the analysis of processes allows the improvement of the overall performance. Similar contributions are expected to expand the current body of research for the ED and increase utilization of these hybrid approaches.",

We have identified 56 articles published between 2013 and 2020. Previous systematic review articles suggest new approaches involving Lean principles in EDs [18, 19, 21] . The main contribution of this article lies in the extent of previous review articles identified in literature by answering the following questions: (i) What research problems in emergency departments can Lean principles help overcome? (ii) What Lean approaches and tools are used most often in this environment? (iii) What are the results and benefits obtained by these practices? and (iv) What research opportunities appear as gaps in the current state of the art on the subject? In this systematic review, articles are classified by research problem into six main groups. Additionally, nine usual approaches and eleven main tools and methods are noted among the included studies. The Lean principles used in emergency departments are identified, grouped by similarity, and organized. Finally, the main improvements and benefits of applying these tools are also listed for each study. The remainder of this article appears as follows: In Section 2, the systematic review methodology is presented. Section 3 reveals the study environment characterization. Section 4 features the research problems, approaches, and tools associated with Lean. In Section 5, we discuss the results and benefits. Finally, in Section 6, conclusions and research opportunities are presented.",

Additional exclusion resulted in 30 articles removed because they did not mention the Emergency Department, leaving 56 documents in the final selection for synthesis in step six. The authors' interactive review process was provided significant agreement for the content analysis. In addition to the general characteristics of the articles identified and the number of articles per year, the articles were classified according to the following criteria: research problems, methodological approaches, tools and methods, and benefits in terms of reductions and improvements. Analysis of criteria aimed to point out the associations between these and the research problems identified in the review. The organization of language into categories increased in importance given the large volume of information available [28] . In this context, this article adopts the following definitions for the elements addressed in its criteria. a. Methodological approach: the concept attributed to the research methods adopted in the researched articles; b. Lean approaches: the concepts attributed to the means that supported the application of the tools and methods; and c. Tools and methods: these were treated together to facilitate the grouping of resources for implementing the listed improvements. Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the 56 studies analyzed in this systematic review based on whether the approach was qualitative or quantitative, whether the study was theoretical or empirical, and the research method type (case study, modeling, etc.). Most of the studies used a qualitative approach (n = 33/56) or theoretical-empirical type (n = 32/56). As for the research method, the majority were characterized as case studies (n = 37/56). It is noteworthy that practices such as simulation and experimentation were rarely used. This systematic review focused on studies applying Lean techniques, which usually describe empirical results without further quantitative treatment.",

Waiting time reduction is the most significant benefit for Emergency Departments. Important waiting times reduction were from 78 to 38 min (>50%) by [16] and 28% by [36] . Waiting time reduction positively affects patient satisfaction and improves related problems such as overcrowding, lack of beds, and mortality rate. VSM is the appropriate and easy-to-use tool to identify excess patient waiting time. Reduction in costs and length of hospital stay is also meaningful. Cost reduction (e.g., 25%) is by loss elimination, activities, and services that do not add value to stakeholders [36] . Length of hospital stay reduction (e.g., 3.6 days to 2.6 days) increases resource availability such as physical space, beds, and time for professionals to provide patient care [37] .",

Lean and complementary approaches such as Six Sigma can increase capacity and reduce waiting time, length of hospital stay, and service costs. We should also consider the interaction between working groups, which it is imperative for Lean implementation.

Some studies on the impact of the Pandemic in emergency departments can be highlighted [80] [81] [82] [83] . Although these studies focus on the main transdisciplinary aspects of team preparation, based on the specifics of each emergency center, the discussion goes beyond any type of benefit that the emergency departments may have enjoyed from the previous implementation of Lean principles. The verification through an efficiency study of the existence of differences between the emergency departments of hospitals that implemented and did not implement tools and Lean methods in their operation emerges as a current and relevant research opportunity. Note that the screening process needs a detailed analysis of the value flow and can use tools such as VSM, for example, to improve their results. Finally, value attributes to patients and physicians also promote Lean tools in health.
