Live and whole inactivated viruses remain a sizeable proportion of clinically used vaccines. Recombinant virus vectors, and in particular, replication incompetent, recombinant adenoviruses are leading vaccine candidates for old, emerging, and pandemic diseases, including several candidates to protect against SARS-CoV-2-induced COVID-19 [1] [2] [3] . These vaccines are heat sensitive and must be stored and distributed at low temperatures. Stabilization of live virus vaccines is challenging, but overcoming this issue is a critical factor for the successful and equitable deployment of vaccines in the field [4] .",

Clinically, this is being addressed through the use of heterologous prime-boost immunization, where a different vaccine platform, such as the poxvirus vector MVA (Modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara) [5] [6] [7] [8] or subunit, adjuvanted protein [9] is used in the second and subsequent immunizations, or through the use of serologically different adenoviruses [10, 11] . Although strong antigen-specific immunity can be induced in clinical trials, the costs and logistics of manufacturing and distributing two or more vaccines and administering them in the correct sequence in every individual, would need to be economically justified before widespread implementation, or alternatively only utilized in epidemic outbreaks.",

            "text": "We previously demonstrated that adenovirus vaccine administration using silicon microneedles permitted repeated use of the same adenovirus vaccine due to the induction of significantly lower anti-vector antibody responses compared to injection with a needle and syringe in mice [12] . However, although silicon microneedles overcome some logistic issues, they do not address vaccine stability. Dissolvable microneedles are micron-scale protrusions that are sharp enough to insert into the skin. They are composed of suitable excipients that incorporate, and should stabilize, vaccines in a dry, solid state. On skin insertion the microneedle material dissolves and the vaccine is delivered to the body. Dissolvable microneedle (DMN) patches for skin-based immunization offer several logistic and economic benefits to healthcare systems and individual end-users, including: ease of use; lack of requirement for vaccine reconstitution; more efficient and cost-effective logistics, by removal of cold chain; the elimination of needles, syringes, and hazardous waste; and small package size. We previously developed a novel, drop-dispensing based DMN patch production method that overcomes the waste associated with conventional methods of dissolvable microneedle production [13] [14] [15] . We also developed suitable formulations for stabilizing vaccines in DMN patches to preserve vaccine integrity during microneedle fabrication, upon drying and during subsequent storage [16] .",

A small number of published clinical studies have assessed the impact of adenovirus-based vaccine dose on T cell responses [17, 18] and antibody titers [19] [20] [21] using conventional intramuscular delivery. We therefore wanted to determine how adenovirus vaccine dose impacts on the induction of antibody responses when the vaccine is administered by the intramuscular (IM) or patch-mediated skin route. Here, we chose human adenovirus serotype 5 (AdHu5) as a model adenovirus without intellectual property restrictions, and which is also suitable for thermostability and administration route studies. The immunogenicity and efficacy of AdHu5 vaccines can be readily matched by clinically-applicable simian adenoviruses, as previously demonstrated [22, 23] .",

One vaccine strategy is targeted at the blood-stage of the disease, by blocking merozoite invasion of red blood cells. This approach will likely require the maintenance of high titres of neutralizing antibodies to merozoite proteins. Plasmodium falciparum reticulocyte-binding protein homolog 5 (RH5) has emerged as a strong blood-stage vaccine candidate, and is being clinically tested. In parallel with this development, non-human primate studies have demonstrated that the in vitro assay of antibody-mediated growth inhibition activity (GIA) against P. falciparum serves as an in vitro correlate of vaccine-induced in vivo protection when using vaccines targeting PfRH5 and other blood-stage antigens [27] [28] [29] .",

As adenovirus is a live vaccine where one virus unit can produce an unknown antigen dose in situ, we aimed to determine if dose sparing would be relevant to adenovirus vaccines. To address this question, a range of doses of adenovirus expressing P. falciparum RH5 antigen, AdHu5-PfRH5 [30] , was administered by patches or in liquid format by the IM route to Balb/c mice (Supplementary Figure S1) . A 1 \u00d7 10 8 infectious units, ifu (1.6 \u00d7 10 9 virus particles, vp) vaccine dose by the IM route represented the dose and route of immunization conventionally administered to mice [40] . Only the lowest doses of vaccine by the IM or patch route induced a significantly lower IgG response to the PfRH5 antigen, compared to the conventional vaccine dose (1 \u00d7 10 8 ifu), 8 weeks after the primary immunization ( Figure 2A ; light grey bars). With respect to the induction of anti-vector immunity, lower vaccine doses by either IM (\u22641 \u00d7 10 5 ifu) or skin (\u22645 \u00d7 10 5 ifu) route, also induced significantly lower anti-adenovirus IgG responses after the first immunization, compared to the standard 1 \u00d7 10 8 ifu IM immunization ( Figure 2B ). Incorporation of adenovirus vaccine into dissolvable microneedle (DMN) patches significantly stabilized the vaccine for up to 6 months.

Lowering the priming vaccine dose resulted in increased ratios of anti-PfRH5 to anti-vector responses, irrespective of route, compared to a single, conventional IM immunization. Boosting mice that were primed with 1 \u00d7 10 8 ifu or 1 \u00d7 10 7 ifu of vaccine by the IM route pushed the ratio of antibodies significantly further towards an anti-vector response, as evidenced by significant decreases in the ratio of anti-PfRH5 antibodies to anti-vector post-boost compared to post-prime. For example, in the IM 1 \u00d7 10 7 ifu group, the post-prime geometric mean ratio was 154 (95% CI: 49 to 488) and post-boost this dropped to a geometric mean ratio of 6 (95% CI: 3 to 11). There was no significant change in the ratio of antigen-to vector-specific antibodies from prime to boost in the lower doses (1 \u00d7 10 5 or 1 \u00d7 10 4 ifu) IM groups. Therefore at lower doses given IM, the ratio of antigen to vector specific antibodies could not be modulated by the boost. In contrast, at the lowest vaccine dose administered by DMN patches, the ratio of antigen to vector specific responses was significantly altered, and increased, from prime to boost; the geometric mean ratio post-prime was 198 (95% CI: 131 to 299) and post-boost this significantly increased to a geometric mean ratio of 1232 (95% CI: 266 to 5713). This regimen of the lowest dose administered with a patch (DMN 5 \u00d7 10 4 ifu) and boosted with a vaccine dose of 1 \u00d7 10 8 ifu by the IM route induced the highest ratio of antigen-specific to vector-specific antibodies; these were significantly higher than the IM 1 \u00d7 10 8 ifu approach, and this was the only prime-boost approach that led to a significant increase in this ratio post-boost. Overall, these results demonstrate that repeated IM immunization favors the expansion of anti-vector immune responses, whereas priming with adenovirus vaccine in DMN patches favors the enrichment of antigen-specific IgG. Priming with low vaccine doses, particularly with a DMN patch, thus favors a further skew towards antigen-specific immunity.",

However this must be balanced by the induction of strong immunity that provides protection against pathogen challenge. Mice were thus immunized twice with a low (5 \u00d7 10 4 ifu) or high dose (5 \u00d7 10 7 ifu) of AdHu5-PfRH5 by the IM route or with a patch (Figure 3 ). After the primary immunization, the antibody responses to PfRH5 and to the adenovirus vector demonstrated the same responses as described above. After boosting, mice primed with low dose patches, and boosted with high or low doses patches (DMNlo/DMNlo and DMNlo/DMNhi) had equivalent post-boost anti-PfRH5 antibody responses to repeated high dose IM immunization ( Figure 3A ). Only high doses of vaccine, by either route, had anti-vector antibodies ( Figure 3B ). Both of the low dose DMN groups exhibited significantly higher ratios of anti-PfRH5 to anti-vector antibodies after the first immunization, compared to high dose IM immunization (p < 0.05) ( Figure 3C ). After the boost, all groups, including the group receiving two high doses in a patch, exhibited significantly higher ratios of anti-PfRH5 to anti-vector antibodies compared to repeated high dose IM immunization. This highlights that mice primed with low vaccine doses had post-boost responses dominated by anti-PfRH5 antibodies, as relative to anti-vector antibodies. These results demonstrate that priming and boosting with a low dose (5 \u00d7 10 4 ifu) of vaccine, using patches or by the IM route, significantly skews the antibody response towards the antigen and away from the vector, compared to high dose administration.",

            "text": "Adenovirus vectored vaccines have become a leading platform technology that is demonstrating potential across multiple infectious disease indications. For COVID-19, clinical efficacy has been demonstrated [41] , and a number of adenovirus-based COVID-19 vaccines are now being globally deployed. The ability to repeatedly administer the same adenovirus serotype to significantly increase the anti-transgene immunogenicity would greatly improve immunization programs that utilize this technology. However, the issue of anti-vector immunity [1, 42] decreases the potency of adenovirus-based vaccines upon repeated systemic use, and especially within a short timeframe. Several strategies have been developed to prevent or overcome this issue, including the use of a heterologous boost, with for example, an MVA-based vector or a protein subunit boost [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] 19, 43, 44] . Our study provides a complementary approach of using skin-based delivery with dissolvable microneedle patches to significantly skew the humoral response towards the antigen and away from the vector. We determined that administering lower doses of vaccine skewed the antibody profile towards a higher proportion of antigen-specific, compared to anti-vector, antibodies in mice. Furthermore, stabilizing and administering low doses of vaccine in dissolvable microneedle patches induced the most consistent and favorable skew in the magnitude of antigen-specific IgG, compared to IM injection of liquid vaccine. Finally, immunization with a low vaccine dose with skin patches and boosting with a high dose by the IM route consistently induced the highest level of functional GIA antibodies against the malaria parasite. In contrast, priming with high adenovirus vaccine doses, by either route, induced poor GIA responses.",

            "text": "Adenovirus vectored vaccines have become a leading platform technology that is demonstrating potential across multiple infectious disease indications. For COVID-19, clinical efficacy has been demonstrated [41] , and a number of adenovirus-based COVID-19 vaccines are now being globally deployed. The ability to repeatedly administer the same adenovirus serotype to significantly increase the anti-transgene immunogenicity would greatly improve immunization programs that utilize this technology. However, the issue of anti-vector immunity [1, 42] decreases the potency of adenovirus-based vaccines upon repeated systemic use, and especially within a short timeframe. Several strategies have been developed to prevent or overcome this issue, including the use of a heterologous boost, with for example, an MVA-based vector or a protein subunit boost [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] 19, 43, 44] . Our study provides a complementary approach of using skin-based delivery with dissolvable microneedle patches to significantly skew the humoral response towards the antigen and away from the vector. We determined that administering lower doses of vaccine skewed the antibody profile towards a higher proportion of antigen-specific, compared to anti-vector, antibodies in mice. Furthermore, stabilizing and administering low doses of vaccine in dissolvable microneedle patches induced the most consistent and favorable skew in the magnitude of antigen-specific IgG, compared to IM injection of liquid vaccine. Finally, immunization with a low vaccine dose with skin patches and boosting with a high dose by the IM route consistently induced the highest level of functional GIA antibodies against the malaria parasite. In contrast, priming with high adenovirus vaccine doses, by either route, induced poor GIA responses.",

We also demonstrated the short-term stability of an adenovirus virus vector in DMN patches [15] . Here, we extended this finding to demonstrate the significant stability advantages of incorporating adenovirus vectored vaccine in these patches. Previous attempts to stabilize adenovirus vectors in a solid format have involved drying it onto filter membranes [50] or lyophilization [51] . However, decreases in vaccine viability and potency were observed when adenovirus was dried onto filter paper after 4 weeks at 37 \u2022 C and 45 \u2022 C, and secondly, vaccine on these filters or lyophilized still requires reconstitution and the presence of needles and syringes in order to be administered. In contrast, adenovirus vaccine in our DMN patches retained full potency at 40 \u2022 C for somewhere between 8 to 12 weeks, and remained fully viable in this easy-to-administer, needle-free delivery system, at 25 \u2022 C for at least 6 months, when this study completed. A thin film format of adenovirus has recently been described that demonstrated a similar stability to what we observed in DMN patches, however the immunogenicity of an adenovirus vaccine in this film is unknown [52] . This format has similar attributes to our patches with respect to ease of administration. To our knowledge, our study is the first demonstration that a live vaccine can be stabilized to this extent in a microneedle patch format.",

Other studies have focused on the induction of T cell responses using long (800 \u00b5m) dissolvable microneedles fabricated from carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) [24] , and only after a single immunization. In a small number of macaques, two adenovirus-based HIV vaccines were coated onto dissolving poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microneedles and administered twice, 12 weeks apart. T cell responses were equivalent in microneedle (MN)-treated and IM injected animals [25] . Humoral responses induced after the primary immunization increased after the second MN immunization, however it is unclear how strong this boosting effect was in comparison to IM delivery. Therefore it is possible to boost weak antigen-specific serum antibody titres in macaques by repeated Ad-DMN immunization, however the comparative magnitude of this effect with injected vaccine is unknown [25] . Our present study suggests that repeated low doses, or a low/high prime/boost, repeated adenovirus regime, could be a more suitable regimen to further increase the magnitude of these responses. We previously demonstrated that these sugar-based microneedles fully dissolve in <10 min when administered to porcine skin [15] , and therefore deliver vaccine to the body in a short timeframe, similar to the time period for IM delivery. We observed a similar kinetic profile of the antibody response after a single immunization using an IM injection or a DMN patch ( Figure 6 ). Therefore, although the magnitude of the antibody responses were dependent on the dose and delivery system, the kinetic profile of the serum antibody responses were independent of the vaccine format and route.",

This suggests that repeated higher doses may not be as effective at inducing protective CD8+ T cells. In malaria vaccine trials, a second immunization with two AdHu5-based vaccines, each at 1 \u00d7 10 10 virus particles, administered concurrently, did not boost antibody responses [55] . In a phase I clinical trial of heterologous prime-boost regime for an Ebola virus vaccine, administering the lowest dose of a chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAd3, 1 \u00d7 10 10 vp) primed for a substantially stronger IgG and neutralizing antibody response subsequent to an MVA boost, compared to priming with 2.5 \u00d7 10 10 vp or 5 \u00d7 10 10 vp of ChAd3, although the low number of volunteers in each group prevents statistical analysis [6] . Repeated use of an adenovirus-based COVID-19 vaccine, namely ChAdOx1-nCoV-19 [56] , or malaria vaccine, namely ChAd3-METRAP [57] , did not boot T cell responses in either study, but was demonstrated to be capable of increasing antibody titre and modulating antibody effector function to the spike antigen of SARS-CoV2 [56] , but not to the malaria antigen [58] ; however robust statistical analyses was not feasible in the former study. It is well recognized that T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation strength affects the phenotype of T cell responses; including the generation and function of follicular helper T cells, which are critical to modulating the induction of B cell responses [57] . High antigen dose stimulates T cells of both high and low avidity, thereby permitting expansion of T cells with lower functional quality [57] . Furthermore, increasing antigen dose results in higher expression on T cells of inhibitory receptors, such as PD-1 and CTLA-4 [59] . Here, we add further to these data by demonstrating that a low, compared to high, adenovirus vaccine dose resulted in a significant skew in antibody responses towards the encoded transgene and away from the vector. Decreasing the dose of total adenovirus vector proteins at The effect of the TCR stimulation strength on T cell responses is likely one component of why lower doses of vaccine were more immunogenic in our study, and potentially leads to better priming in the clinicthe time of administration also likely reduces the opportunity for B and T cells to be exposed to vector antigens, while transgene antigen production is maintained above a critical threshold. Finally, decreasing the dose likely also reduced the induction of innate immune response genes, which have been shown to inversely correlate with antigen expression from adenovirus vectored vaccines [60] .",

Fast, cost-effective deployment of vaccines is a required attribute in a vaccine-based response to disease outbreaks. Distribution in regular, room temperature drug distribution networks would address the current cold chain constraints in vaccine deployment. We have developed a stabilized vaccine platform that addresses this issue. Secondly, our skin patch system also addresses the constraints surrounding training vaccinators to prepare and inject vaccines, and safely dispose of biohazardous waste. In addition to these solutions to vaccine access issues, we demonstrate here that this patch system is also capable of significantly enhancing the induction of protective immune responses compared to conventional injection-based immunization. We conclude that further translation of this technology is warranted based on these findings and on the clinical need to address these access and efficacy issues.",
