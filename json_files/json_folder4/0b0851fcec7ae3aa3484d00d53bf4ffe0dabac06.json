Based on a module for academic poster presenta-Versorgungsforschung, Heidelberg, Germany tion in front of an interprofessional plenum, the sequence of the learning process organization in the phases \"kick-off\", \"self-directed learning\" and \"online seminar\" is exemplified and discussed with regard to its suitability for digital interprofessional teaching. Implementation: During implementation it was important to clearly define the module's scope and sequence at the very beginning. The use of screencasts enabled students to individually pace their learning during the preparatory self-directed learning phase. Embedding assignments in the screencasts served to aid students in their learning. The synchronous exchange in interprofessional small groups was experienced as profitable for the own poster production. Several students perceive their own poster presentation in digital format as an increase in competence and a basis for future academic presentations. Summary: In summary, the entire interprofessional module was successfully implemented digitally in the phases \"kick-off\", \"self-directed learning\" and \"online seminar\". For synchronous learning, virtual small group workspaces seem particularly suitable for learner activation. The practical implementation of the acquired competencies in the form of the poster presentation is crucial for ensuring the learning success.",

After completing the simultaneous, yet separate training, students begin working part-time as young professionals in their respective occupations in clinical health care. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic many students had to increase their work hours up to 100% due to shortfalls in personnel, which increased the double burden of work and study. Teaching in the degree program was completely switched to online formats. The core elective project module involves 135 hours of cooperation on a research project, a project promoting quality, or a project on international exchange. The mod-ule's aim is to have students gather profession-specific experience in project work and, at the same time, acquire both academic and interprofessional competencies. For this purpose, a seminar (15 hours in total) is held alongside the project, in which the students are taught academic competencies for the submission, presentation and discussion of conference contributions and in which the interprofessional exchange about the project work is stimulated. Learning is assessed by preparation and presenting an academic poster in front of an interprofessional group.",

This competency model assumes that interprofessional learning takes place in three successive phases depending on the educational level of the students (see figure 1 ). The first phase entails the asynchronous teaching of knowledge-based content (exposure level). In the second, synchronous phase, the focus is on activating the students to apply their acquired knowledge and to engage in discussions (immersion level). Both phases can be categorized as self-directed learning within the concept of blended learning. The third, also synchronous, phase targets interprofessional interaction between students and was implemented as an online seminar in the blended-learning process (mastery level). For example, a student with a background in medical laboratory science (MTLA) would present the results of their collaboration on a research project in the laboratory, while a student with expertise in physiotherapy would present a project on quality assurance in ambulatory care. Notwithstanding how the module is realized interprofessionally in the IPG degree program, this strategy to impart scholarly competencies is also transferrable to monoprofessional groups. The implementation of the teaching concept is illustrated in the following.",

A follow-up assignment was given at the end of the asynchronous phase.

The interaction between the students was encouraged through clear instructions for sharing thoughts and information about the evaluated posters. One person in each group was selected to take notes and another to serve as the group's spokesperson who later presented the results in the plenary session. In addition to exchanging cross-professional scientific aspects, the focus was on linking different professional perspectives and identifying overlaps in order to work through and complete a shared task. The instructors were available via chat to answer questions and were able to enter and participate in the separate breakout rooms as needed (questions of the students, halting of the exchange in break-out sessions). The spokespersons from the small groups then presented the results of their group's virtual poster evaluations and ensuing discussion in the plenum. As this was done, suggestions for improvement were worked on together to be applied later to the students' own posters. The session information was recorded by writing notes down on a virtual whiteboard. The self-directed learning phase can be described on two competency levels: On the basic level (exposure), the emphasis was on the student's own role and responsibility [5] . The students were required to assess their own level of knowledge and justify the evaluation of an academic poster based on a set of criteria. The assignment was given with a set of concrete instructions and defined as a pre-requisite for the subsequent learning steps. Working through the screencasts and the study assignment was then done individually by the students on a flexible basis. At the intermediate level (immersion), the focus was turned to activating the students [5] . They were asked to explain and discuss the results with their peers and to reach a consensus on the final evaluation. To accomplish this, cooperative learning activities were encouraged as part of using the breakout rooms. A clear assignment along with instructions on presenting the results ensured that the students' interactions were goal-oriented under the guidance of a spokesperson.",

Mittels Screencasts konnte danach eine individuelle Festlegung des Lerntempos in der selbstgesteuerten vorbereitenden Lernphase stattfinden. Die Einbettung von Arbeitsauftr\u00e4gen in die aufgezeichneten Screencasts unterst\u00fctze die Student_innen beim Lernen. Der synchrone Austausch in interprofessionellen Kleingruppen wurde als gewinnbringend f\u00fcr die eigene Postererstellung erlebt. Einige Student_innen empfanden die eigene Posterpr\u00e4sentation in digitalem Format als Kompetenzzuwachs und Basis f\u00fcr sp\u00e4tere wissenschaftliche Pr\u00e4sentationen. Fazit: Zusammenfassend zeigte sich, dass das gesamte interprofessionelle Modul digital in den Phasen \"Kick-off\", \"Selbstgesteuertes Lernen\" und \"Online-Seminar\" erfolgreich umsetzbar war. F\u00fcr das synchrone in Lernen erscheinen insbesondere virtuelle Kleingruppenarbeitsr\u00e4ume zur Lerneraktivierung geeignet. Die praktische Umsetzung der erworbenen Kompetenzen in Form der Posterpr\u00e4sentation ist entscheidend f\u00fcr die Absicherung des Lernerfolges. im Plenum vor. Dabei wurden gemeinsam Verbesserungsvorschl\u00e4ge f\u00fcr den Transfer f\u00fcr ein eigenes Poster erarbeitet. Die Ergebnissicherung erfolgte auf virtuellem Whiteboard. Die Phase des selbstgesteuerten Lernens kann auf zwei Kompetenzleveln beschrieben werden: Auf dem Basis-Level (Exposure) lag der Fokus auf der eigenen Rolle und Verantwortlichkeit [5]. Die Student_innen mussten sich mit dem eigenen Wissenstand auseinandersetzen und die Bewertung wissenschaftlicher Poster anhand von Kriterien begr\u00fcnden. Die Verbindlichkeit des Arbeitsauftrags wurde durch konkrete Instruktionen und als Voraussetzung f\u00fcr nachfolgende Lernschritte herausgestellt. Die Bearbeitung der Screencasts und des NBA erfolgte dann flexibel und individuell von den Student_innen. Im Aufbau-Level (Immersion) liegt der Fokus auf der Aktivierung der Student_innen [5]. Sie mussten sich mit den Ergebnissen ihrer Kommiliton_innen auseinandersetzen und gemeinsam zu einer abschlie\u00dfenden Bewertung gelangen. Dazu wurde \u00fcber die Nutzung der virtuellen Kleingruppenr\u00e4ume kooperative Lernaktivit\u00e4ten angeregt. Ein klarer Arbeitsauftrag sowie Instruktionen zur Ergebnispr\u00e4sentation stellten sicher, dass ergebnisorientierte Interaktionen mithilfe von Sprecher_innen stattfinden. Im weiteren Semesterverlauf fanden drei Online-Seminare statt, in denen die Student_innen eigene Projektarbeiten im Rahmen einer Pr\u00fcfungsleistung als E-Poster pr\u00e4sentierten. Das Eingehen auf Fragen in der anschlie\u00dfenden interprofessionellen Diskussion war Teil der Pr\u00fcfung. Im Kontext des interprofessionellen Lernens wurde mit Fokus auf der Interaktion der Student_innen in dieser Phase zuvor Gelerntes praktisch in den eigenen virtuellen Posterpr\u00e4sentationen angewandt und damit ein Praxis-Level erreicht (Mastery) [5]. Lessons Learned/Fazit Die R\u00fcckmeldungen der Student_innen erfolgten im Chat der Online-Seminare, als Blitzlichtfeedback via Umfrage und individuell per E-Mail oder telefonisch im Rahmen einer allgemeinen Beratung. Dir Student_innen begr\u00fc\u00dften insbesondere die M\u00f6glichkeit der Festlegung eines eigenen Lerntempos f\u00fcr die Screencast-Bearbeitung. Auch von den Dozentinnen wurde beobachtet, dass die Screencasts und Nachbereitungsauftr\u00e4ge von den Student_innen sehr zuverl\u00e4ssig bearbeitet wurden und alle gut vorbereitet zu den synchronen Online-Lehreinheiten erschienen. Der Austausch und die Pr\u00e4sentation in interprofessionellen Kleingruppen wurde als gewinnbringendes Lehrformat und die Ergebnissicherung mittels Whiteboardprotokoll als hilfreiche Visualisierung des Gelernten erlebt. Mehrheitlich wurde allerdings kritisch angemerkt, dass die Student_innen sich die eigene Posterpr\u00e4sentation als Pr\u00e4senzpr\u00e4sentation w\u00fcnschen. Auch die Dozentinnen beobachteten, dass die Diskussion zu den Pr\u00e4sentationen der Pr\u00fcflinge stockender verlief als in Pr\u00e4senz. Daraus ergibt sich folgendes Fazit: \u2022 Das Konzept des Blended Learning l\u00e4sst sich in der ausschlie\u00dflichen Online-Lehre auch in interprofessionellen Gruppen umsetzen. \u2022 Durch asynchrone Lehreinheiten, die selbstgesteuert bearbeitet werden, wird die Flexibilit\u00e4t in Arbeit und Studium unterst\u00fctzt. \u2022 Die Setzung eines verbindlichen Rahmens zu Beginn des Moduls und eine Lernerfolgskontrolle mittels Arbeitsauftr\u00e4gen und Feedback ist f\u00fcr die Phase des selbstgesteuerten Lernens wichtig. \u2022 F\u00fcr das Lernen ist entscheidend, die Aktivit\u00e4t und Interaktion der Student_innen zu f\u00f6rdern. Arbeitsauftr\u00e4ge, die in virtuellen Kleingruppenarbeitsr\u00e4umen gemeinsam bearbeitet werden, sind hierf\u00fcr besonders geeignet. \u2022 Die praktische Umsetzung theoretisch gelernter Inhalte bildet die h\u00f6chste Stufe des Lernprozesses und ist f\u00fcr den praxisbezogenen Kompetenzerwerb unerl\u00e4sslich. Nach der beschriebenen Pilotimplementierung ist eine strukturierte prospektive Evaluation des Moduls geplant. Hierf\u00fcr wird im WiSe 2020/21 ein Online-Fragebogen eingesetzt, der sich sowohl auf den fachlichen Kompetenzerwerb als auch auf das interprofessionelle Lernen bezieht. Sofern die Pandemielage es erm\u00f6glicht, sollen die Posterpr\u00e4sentationen zum Abschluss allerdings in Pr\u00e4senz erfolgen.",
