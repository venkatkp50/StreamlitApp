The epidemic later spread to other countries, reaching Egypt and Africa on 14 February 2020. On 11 March 2020, the disease was declared by the WHO a global pandemic. 2 Proper clinical management and control of this pandemic warrant laboratory diagnosis and testing of appropriate specimens from patients meeting the suspected case Strengths and limitations of this study \u25ba The study will contribute to strengthening the evidence base on the effectiveness of laboratory testing strategies for COVID-19 in hospitals and community populations in low-income and middleincome countries (LMICs). \u25ba The protocol has been written following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. \u25ba The GRADE system will be used to ascertain the strength of the evidence base for each outcome and to report data for the primary outcome in a 'Summary of Findings table'. \u25ba The review is limited to evidence from LMICs. \u25ba Non-English databases will not be searched and this may introduce language bias.",

This high cost is a potential barrier to majority of the population. Furthermore, this method is unable to meet the principles of early detection, early isolation and early treatment and hence not favourable for prevention and control of the epidemic. 5 Existing evidence also highlights inconsistencies in the diagnostic accuracy of these assays. More so, most of the evidence on diagnostic accuracy is largely from developed countries, where the COVID-19 curves are flattening. Low-income and middle-income settings are now the epicentre of the pandemic, yet evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of existing tests is largely lacking. This review addresses this knowledge gap on the diagnostic accuracy of available assays to further strengthen the role of testing in the COVID-19 response in these settings.",

These are derived under optimal laboratory conditions Open access and are prerequisites to consideration of efficacy at all subsequent levels. These include the turnaround time, type of the sample and diagnostic test algorithm, that is, single test or series of tests. (2) Diagnostic accuracy efficacy is characterised by the yield of abnormal or normal diagnoses in a case series. This will be measured as a percentage of the correct diagnoses in the case series, the positive and negative predictive values, and the sensitivity and specificity of a given COVID-19 laboratory diagnostic test. (3) Societal efficacy goes beyond the individual risk and benefit of a given COVID-19 test and denotes the cost borne by the society as whole for the diagnostic test to be acceptable for use regardless of the efficacy of the test on individual patient application at any other level. We will estimate whether a given COVID-19 laboratory test is efficacious to an extent that it is an efficient use of resources and provides medical benefits to the society given the lowincome and middle-income setting. We will calculate the cost per unit output (measures from level 1 to 6) of a given COVID-19 diagnostic test and the cost-effectiveness by calculating the ICER as a difference between the costs of two given COVID-19 laboratory tests divided by the difference in their effects (measures from level 2).",

Second, the quantitative synthesis will be outcome-based considering the primary outcome (diagnostic test accuracy of COVID-19 laboratory tests) and the secondary outcomes (costs, cost-effectiveness, turnaround times and the diagnostic testing strategy: centralised versus peripheral; and targeted individual testing versus pooling of samples for scale-up). We will use mixed effects model with the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method to calculate the overall target score for accuracy. Reporting of these findings will be in line with the PRIS-MA-DTA statement. 12 Risk of bias assessment Two reviewers (EN, OKO, NL or KE) will independently evaluate the methodological quality using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies approach (QUADAS-2 tool). 14 Bias will be assessed by making judgements (high, low and unclear) on individual elements from five domains (selection bias, attrition bias, performance bias, reporting bias, detection bias and other biases, ie, conflict of interest).
