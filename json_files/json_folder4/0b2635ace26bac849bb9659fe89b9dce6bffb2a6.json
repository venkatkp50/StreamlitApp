However, leaf fresh weight and dry J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 weight were significantly higher in plants grown under SL + L-LED and SL + H-LED than under SL due to their thicker leaves reflected by the lower specific leaf area. Plants grown under SL had significantly lower concentrations of total chlorophyll (Chl) and total carotenoids (Car) but higher Chl a/b ratio than under SL + L-LED and SL + H-LED. However, all plants had similar Chl/Car ratios. Although midday Fv/Fm ratio was the lowest in leaves grown under SL+ H-LED followed by SL+ L-LED and SL, predawn Fv/Fm ratios of all leaves were higher than 0.8. Increasing growth irradiance with supplemental LED resulted in higher electron transport rate and photochemical quenching but lower non-photochemical quenching compared to those of plants grown under SL. Measured under their respective growth irradiance in the greenhouse, attached leaves grown under SL + L-LED and SL+H-LED had significantly higher photosynthetic CO2 assimilation rate and stomatal conductance than under SL. However, measuring the detached leaves at 25 o C in the laboratory, there were no significant differences in PS II and Cyt b6f concentrations although lightand CO2-statured photosynthetic O2 evolution rates were slightly higher in leaves grown under SL+ H-LED than under SL.

Today, in Singapore, all kinds of leafy vegetables are grown all year round in the greenhouse using soilless culture systems with adequate water and nutrient supplies, which is not affected by drought conditions. Apart from water, light intensity critically affects plant growth. In the past two decades, Singapore has been frequently experiencing increasingly unpredictable cloudy and hazy weather (Nobre et al., 2016) , resulting in lowered light intensity which reduced crop productivity (Jones, 2006) . We have previously reported that in Singapore, when lettuce (He et al., 2011) and Brassica alboglabra (Chinese broccoli) plants (He et al., 2019) were grown under low light during the haze episodes in the greenhouse, lower photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and productivity were measured. To circumvent the problem of insufficient sunlight, in another study with lettuce plants, light emitting diode (LED) lighting was supplemented to low sunlight intensity in the greenhouse (Choong et al., J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2018; He et al., 2019) .

In the study with B. alboglabra (Chinese broccoli), we have found that plants grown under shade with supplemental LED lighting improved photosynthetic CO2 assimilation, stomatal conductance and productivity (He et al., 2019b) . As mentioned earlier, sweet potato leaves are tropical leafy vegetables and have fast growth rates in the tropics under warm and humid conditions . The nutrient-rich leaf blade and petiole make it as one of the suitable vegetable crops to achieve the Singapore's goal to produce 30 per cent of nutritional needs locally by 2030. However, little is known about its photosynthetic characteristics when grown under different light intensities using soilless culture such as hydroponics. We hypothesize that plant growth should increase with increasing of growth irradiance, with leaf traits adjustment that enhance light capture and carbon fixation in the tropical greenhouse. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of two different supplementary LED lightings with photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 150 and 300 \u00b5mol m -2 s -1 respectively on the leaf growth of sweet potato leaves, I. batatas (var.

Following an initial dark equilibration for 10 min, the repetitive flash illumination was applied for 4 min, followed by 4 min darkness. This was followed by a second cycle of flashes and darkness. The average dark drift in the signal before and after repetitive-flash illumination was subtracted algebraically from the net rate of O2 evolution during flash illumination to obtain the gross rate of flash-induced O2 evolution. A small heating artefact signal due to flash illumination was obtained by substituting a green paper disc for a leaf disc, and was corrected for. The limitation of linear electron transport by PS I was minimized by the use of background far-red light. The ratio of the gross rate of O2 evolution to the flash frequency was used to derive the PS II concentration on a J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f leaf area basis (p), assuming that after four flashes, each active PS II evolves one O2 molecule (Chow et al., 1991) . Second, after repetitive-flash illumination, a light response curve of PN was measured under continuous white light. The leaf disc was illuminated at 15 different light intensities, starting from the lowest PPFD of 0 to 1870 \u00b5mol m -2 s -1 . The leaf disc was illuminated at each PPFD over several minutes until steady-state of photosynthetic O2 evolution rate was obtained. The saturating, continuous irradiance (1870 \u00b5mol m -2 s -1 ) was used to determine the photosynthetic capacity (Pmax). The post-illumination drift was subtracted algebraically from the steady-state net O2 evolution rate at PPFD of 1870 \u00b5mol m -2 s -1 to yield the gross O2 evolution rate, Pmax. For calibration of the oxygen signals, 1mL of air at 25 \u00b0C (taken to contain 8.584 \u00b5mol O2) was injected into the gas-phase O2 electrode chamber.",

            "text": "These results are not in accordance with the usually increased Chl a/b ratio of plants grown under high-irradiance compared to those grown under low-irradiance (Evans and Poorter, 2001) . Zivcak et al. (2014) suggested that effects of light intensity on Chl a/b ratio is not a universal phenomenon and the dependence of Chl a/b ratio on light intensity is strongly correlated to plant species. In this study, the supplemental LED-lighting was provided by a combination of red-and blue-LED lighting in the ratio of 9:1. The effects of light conditions on Chl a/b ratio could result from both the light intensity and light quality, which merits our further study. Car concentration of sweet potato leaves increased by 8 and 27%, under SL + L-LED and SL + H-LED respectively, compared to those grown under SL alone (Fig. 3D) . Generally, Car concentration was higher for sunacclimated leaves compared to that of shade-grown leaves (Demmig-Adams and Adams, 1996; Lichtenthaler, 2007) . Carotenoids play important roles in photosynthesis (Pogson et al., 2005) and protect plants from the harmful effects of excess exposure to light by maintaining proper Chl/Car ratio (or Car/Chl ratio) for optimal photosynthesis and photoprotection (Hashimoto et al., 2016) . Biosynthesis of Chl increases with increasing light intensity (Bj\u00f6rkman, 1981) . However, under adverse environmental conditions such as high temperature, high light inhibits Chl formation due to photoinhibition (He et al., 1996) . In this study, all leaves had predawn Fv/Fm ratio > 0.8 Chls are essential molecules that catch light energy to drive photosynthetic electron transfer (Fromme et al., 2013) . Sweet potato leaves grown under high-irradiance had thicker leaves and higher Chl concentrations are associated with higher ETR compared to those grown under lowirradiance (Fig. 5A) . When measurements were carried out from 801 to the highest 1501 \u00b5mol m -2 s -1 , which were within the maximum ranges of PPFD under which all leaves were developed, the ETR readings were 80-98% and 55-75% respectively higher in SL + H-LED and SL + L-LED leaves than that in leaves grown under SL (Fig. 5A) . Not only ETR but also qP was modified by the light conditions, with slower declines in qP in leaves grown under SL + L-LED and SL + H-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f LED compared to that in leaves grown under SL except for the measurements at the higher PPFD of 1501 \u00b5mol m -2 s -1 (Fig. 5B) . The values of qP were significantly higher for the leaves grown under high-irradiance such as SL + L-LED and SL + H-LED than those under lower irradiance of SL inside the greenhouse, indicating that high-irradiance improve photosynthetic light use efficiency (Feng et al., 2019) . It was reported that high growth irradiance increased ETR and qP while decreased the NPQ (Zivcak et al., 2014; Feng, 2019) . These were also observed in this study with sweet potato leaves grown under SL + H-LED had low NPQ when measurements were made from 146 to 611 \u00b5mol m -2 s -1 compared to those grown under SL. However, decreased NPQ was not observed in leaves grown under SL + L-LED (Fig. 5C ).",

Similar results were also reported in spinach (Chow and Hope, 1987) , Alocasia macrorrhiza and Hordeum vulgarae (De la Torre and Burkey, 1990) . However, in this study, sweet potato leaves grown under SL+ L-LED and SL + H-LED increased ETR and qP while the concentrations of PS II (Fig. 6B) and Cyt b6f (Fig. 6C) remained unchanged compared to those grown under SL. Higher ETR and qP observed in this study may be due to the tuning of the amount of active PSII reaction centres and regulating the electron transfer by the Cyt b6f complex (Tikkanen et al., 2012) rather than the modified concentrations.

In their paper, Terashima et al. (2006) confirmed that there were sufficient mesophyll surfaces in the thicker sun leaves for CO2 dissolution and transport to the chloroplasts. Thicker sun leaves of C3 plants could maintain the CO2 concentration in the chloroplast as high as possible for ribulose 1.5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) (Terashima et al., 2006) . Furthermore, thicker leaves accumulated more photosynthetic enzymes on a leaf area basis and thus contributed to greater CO2 fixation capacity of high-light grown leaves (Evans and Poorter, 2001) .

Different light conditions could be the main factors resulting in different gs. Optimal combinations of blue-and red-LED used in this study could enhance gs, which have been previously reported in cucumber (Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2016) and lettuce (Wang et al., 2016; Choong et al., 2018) . It is well known that stomata are responsible for balancing photosynthetic CO2 uptake with water loss through transpiration. Although it was unable to measure the root biomass in this study, all sweet potato plants had well developed big root systems to ensure water and nutrient uptake (Poorter et al., 2012) . Thus, all leaves had similar transpiration rate (Fig. 7D) although leaves grown under SL had significantly lower gs compared to those grown under SL supplemented with LED lighting.",

However, sweet potato leaves grown under SL had significantly higher SLA compared to those grown under SL + L-LED and SL + H-LED(Fig. 1B).

            "text": "grow sweet potato leaves in the tropical greenhouse using hydroponic systems under supplemental LED lighting to prevailing natural sunlight. Light is the most crucial factor for plant growth and development as well as the efficiency of the photosynthesis(Vialet-Chabrand et al., 2017;Gommers, 2020). Plants can adjust their morphological and physiological traits such as leaf size, SLA, leaf mass and Chl content when they are subjected to changing light conditions. This study was carried out in the tropical greenhouse from the middle of February to early April 2020, when the weather was warm and sunny. The average highest ambient temperature was about 34 to 36 \uf0b0C under full sunlight and maximum PPFD in an open field on sunny days outside the greenhouse ranged from 1400 to 1600 \u00b5mol m -2 s -1 for at least 4 hours from 1100h to 1500h. However, the average maximum PPFD inside the greenhouse was round 700 to 800 \u00b5mol m -2 s -1 , which was 50% of full sunlight but the average ambient temperature could be as high as 38 to 40 \uf0b0C with the highest of 43 o C during midday for at least 4 hours. It was aJ o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f surprise to observe that inside the hot greenhouse, the leaves of all sweet potato plants grew very fast and were very healthy, especially those grown under SL supplemented with constant PPFDs of either 150 (SL + L-LED) or 300 \u00b5mol m -2 s -1 (SL + H-LED), for a 12 h photoperiod. These observations were supported by the results shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Although there was no significant difference in leaf area of the youngest fully expanded leaves grown under different light conditions one week after emergence (Fig. 1A), leaf FW and DW were significantly higher in leaves grown under SL + L-LED and SL + H-LED than under SL alone (Figs. 2A and 2B). All leaves had similar water content (Fig. 2C) and thus, higher leaf FW and DW resulted from the greater thickness of those grown under supplemental LED lighting, which was supported by the lower SLA(Fig. 1B). Low SLA is associated with greater leaf thickness as SLA is measured as the ratio of leaf area to leaf dry mass(Hunt et al. 2002). It was previously reported by our studies that both light quantity and quality affected SLA of leafy vegetables within the species(Choong et al., 2018;He et al., 2019a).Grown under low-light conditions, plants usually develop leaves with higher SLA compared to those grown under high-light conditionsVialet-Chabrand et al., 2017;Zhang et al., 2019). According toPoorter et al. (2018), light-capture-related traits such as SLA and Chl content are strongly related to light, and therefore vary mostly within species. The higher SLA of sweet potato leaves grown under low-light conditions such as only SL(Fig. 1B)could be interpreted as a mechanism to optimize light harvesting. However, under high-light conditions such as SL + H-LED conditions, lower SLA(Fig. 1B)could help plants to increase the efficiency of light capture(Evans and Poorter, 2001;Liu et al., 2016). In the study with soybean, Fan et al.,(2018)and Feng et al. (2019) reported that Chl a, Chl b, total Chl and Car contents increased with the increase in light intensity, which were directly associated with leaf thickness. The results of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f this study with potato leaves grown under SL + L-LED and SL + H-LED conditions having higher Chl a, Chl b, total Chl and Car concentrations on a per area basis (Figs. 3A to D) are consistent",

The greatest decrease of midday Fv/Fm ratio was observed in leaves grown under SL + H-LED , which were exposed to the highest PPFD about 1150 \u00b5mol m -2 s -1 . The midday Fv/Fm ratio remained higher for leaves of plants grown under SL with the lowest midday PPFD (700 to 800 \u00b5mol m -2 s -1 ). Grown under SL + L-LED subjected to a PPFD of 1000 \u00b5mol m -2 s -1 , the decrease of midday Fv/Fm ratio was inbetween(Fig. 4B).
