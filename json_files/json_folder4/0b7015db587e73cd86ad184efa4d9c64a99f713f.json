If stock is at 4mg/mL, dilute this by 1:1000 in 1x TBS, add 50ul to each well. b. 1hr incubations should be done on a rotating surface if possible c. For all incubations: make sure to cover ELISA plate with plastic wrap and place into a tupperware box with a damp paper towel inside to ensure even distribution of humidity. 2. Wash x3 in ELISA plate washer with 0.2% TBST, by placing directly into the washer, then blot on a dry paper towel when done. 3. Add 100 \u00b5l of Blocking Buffer and incubate for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. 4. While blocking, make all serum dilutions in BSC according to these guidelines based on 1 ELISA Plate: a. For 1:20 dilution: Add 380 uL of blocking buffer into all serum dilution tubes. b. Add 20ul of sample into each tube. Mix 3x in the sample tube before and after adding to the dilution tube. c. Control volumes at 1:20: i. One ELISA plate: 285 uL blocking buffer + 15 uL control ii. Two ELISA plates: 475 uL blocking buffer + 25 uL control 5. After blocking is completed, dump blocking buffer into sink, blot on a dry paper towel. 6. Primary Antibody: Add 50ul/well of your diluted sera or control reagents, pipette up and down 30 times before adding to ELISA to mix. Incubate at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour. a. While primary is incubating, make secondary antibody dilution, vortex/mix well and store at 4\u00b0C. 7. Remove your sample from the ELISA plate by carefully pipetting out in BSC into liquid waste. Do not touch the bottom of well with the pipette tip.",
