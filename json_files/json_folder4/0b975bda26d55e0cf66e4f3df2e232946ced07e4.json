            "text": "Background 27 The major global health threat tuberculosis is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Mtb has a complex 28 cell envelope -a partially covalently linked composite of polysaccharides, peptidoglycan and lipids, including a 29 mycolic acid layer -which conveys pathogenicity but also protects against antibiotics. Given previous successes 30 in treating gram-positive and -negative infections with cell wall degrading enzymes, we investigated such 31 approach for Mtb. 32 Objectives 33 (i) Development of an Mtb microtiter growth inhibition assay that allows undisturbed cell envelope formation, to 34 overcome the invalidation of results by typical clumped Mtb-growth in surfactant-free assays. (ii) Exploring anti- 35 Mtb potency of cell wall layer-degrading enzymes. (iii) Investigation of the concerted action of several such 36 enzymes. 37 Methods 38 We inserted a bacterial luciferase-operon in an auxotrophic Mtb strain to develop a microtiter assay that allows 39 proper evaluation of cell wall degrading anti-Mtb enzymes. We assessed growth-inhibition by enzymes 40 (recombinant mycobacteriophage mycolic acid esterase (LysB), fungal \u03b1-amylase and human and chicken egg 41 white lysozymes) and combinations thereof, in presence or absence of biopharmaceutically acceptable surfactant. 42 ",

            "text": "Our biosafety level-2 assay identified both LysB and lysozymes as potent Mtb-inhibitors, but only in presence of 44 surfactant. Moreover, most potent disruption of the mycolic acid hydrophobic barrier was obtained by the highly 45 synergistic combination of LysB, \u03b1-amylase and polysorbate 80. Bacteriophage PG-degrading enzymes (endolysins) are increasingly investigated as antibacterial agents, with 65 several products for topical use against Gram-positive infections already on the market, 12,13 and progress being 66 made for Gram-negative pathogens. 14-16 Such products are rapidly gaining attention due to the looming antibiotics 67 resistance crisis, together with improved know-how in biopharmaceutical protein production and formulation for 68 nebulization or dry powder inhalation. In the context of respiratory diseases such as TB, it is encouraging that several recombinant biopharmaceutical protein treatments (e.g. dornase alpha to reduce viscosity of airway 70 mucus) have been successfully developed for inhalation. 17 However, due to their distinctive cell wall, 71 bacteriophage-mediated lysis of mycobacteria is more complicated than that of other Gram-positives. In addition 72 to endolysin, mycobacteriophages employ a mycomembrane-targeting mycolylarabinogalactan esterase (LysB) to 73 lyse mycobacteria. 18 Obviously this could affect the validity of results obtained with cell wall degrading enzymes, and precludes 92 exploration of surface-active components in the enzyme cocktail. In this study, we solve both problems by developing a bioluminescent derivative of a biosafety level 2 triple auxotrophic Mtb. 33 The bacterial lux operon 94 used does not require cellular uptake of any cofactor, 34 which allows for quantifying metabolic activity in static, 95 clumped cultures. 96 We set out to systematically assess the potency of enzymes that degrade the various layers of the Mtb cell wall, 97 using cultivation conditions that keep the Mtb cell wall/biofilm intact. Apart from PG and the mycomembrane, we 98 targeted the outer capsule of Mtb. Considering that \u03b1-glucan is a main constituent of this capsule, 10 we speculated 99 that Aspergillus oryzae \u03b1-amylase, an \u03b1-glucan hydrolyzing enzyme already used in human medicine to treat 100 pancreatic insufficiency, could have a capsule-destabilizing effect and potentially synergise with the known 101 capsule destabilization imparted by polysorbate 80. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the anti-TB potency of 102 cell wall-degrading enzyme treatments would be enhanced by using the enzymes in cocktails, which could 103 potentially 'peel' the cell envelope layer-by-layer and synergistically weaken it (Figure 1 ). Amylase-induced 104 hydrolysis of the capsular layer may, for instance, increase permeability for enzymes such as LysB that degrade 105 the mycomembrane and/or for enzymes such as lysozyme that degrade the PG layer underneath. 106 ",

It is the most lethal infectious disease 53 worldwide and while it might be surpassed by COVID-19 in 2020, it still poses a major global health threat -and 54 worryingly, multidrug-resistance is on the rise. Treatment success of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) 55 is currently only 57% and the very protracted treatment comes with harsh side-effects. 1 Recent advances in drug 56 development have drastically shortened the treatment of MDR-TB and provided more tolerable oral regimens 57 composed of both established TB drugs, novel compounds and repurposed drugs. 1-5 Still, MDR-TB treatment 58 typically takes 9 to 20 months and the search for more effective and quicker acting drugs is ongoing. Main 59 challenges are the slow growth of Mtb and the relatively impermeable, complex layered cell wall structure of 60 mycobacteria (Figure 1), in which the cell membrane is covered by a layer of peptidoglycan (PG) covalently linked 61 to arabinogalactan. Mycolic acids are esterified to the AG and together with free, intercalating (glyco-and 62 phospho-) lipids and fatty acids, they constitute a near impermeable outer 'mycomembrane'. 6-9 This 63 mycomembrane is surrounded by a capsule comprised mainly of \u03b1-glucan. 10,11 64",

To allow for synergy testing,175    horizontal twofold dilution series of one compound were combined with vertical twofold dilution series of another 176 compound in a 'checkerboard' fashion (Supplementary B). Afterwards, the Mtb mc 2 7902_Lux inoculum was added 177 to 2\u202210 5 cfu per well.

Assay plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C in an incubator180    providing 5% CO2 and 80% humidity, which yielded a higher reproducibility than when plates were placed (in a 181 sealed box or plastic bag) in a regular incubator (data not shown).

            "text": "wall degrading enzymes inhibit mycobacterial growth207    Lux operon-induced bioluminescence has already been shown to correlate very well with (inhibition of)208    mycobacterial growth in drug susceptibility assays. 34,36  We therefore used this bioluminescence to reliably209    evaluate the antimycobacterial activity of recombinant LysB-Ms6 and LysB-D29 as well as commercially available 210 lysozyme (human and chicken egg white) and \u03b1-amylase (A. oryzae) and antibiotics isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin 211 (RIF). Bioluminescence was determined after 1, 4, 7, 10 and 14 days of incubation. When modeling dose-response212    curves, inhibition often appeared incomplete at day 1 (parameter A not zero) and after excluding that time point,213    the highest percentage of explained variance was consistently obtained at day 4. Therefore, minimal inhibitory 214 concentrations (MICs) were determined at this time point(Table 2 and Figure 3b).215    We calculated a MIC of INH in the same order of magnitude as described in Andreu et al at day 4.34  The MIC we 216 calculated for RIF was approximately ten-fold higher, but it should be noted we used a different strain of Mtb 217 (pathogenic H37Rv in literature versus mc 2 7902 in our study) and our definition of MIC is more stringent than that 218 used in literature (1 log reduction in bioluminescence).219    Both human and chicken egg white lysozyme were only marginally inhibiting mycobacterial growth by themselves, 220 but become equally effective (p=0.318; t-test) in presence of polysorbate 80, with activities enhanced 6 to 8-fold 221 (Figure 3bandTable 2). \u03b1-Amylase, on the other hand, did not considerably affect growth in the concentration 222 range tested, neither in the presence nor in the absence of surfactant (MIC \u2265250 \u00b5M). LysB-D29 and LysB-Ms6 223 could inhibit growth equally effectively in presence of polysorbate 80 (MIC= 0.08 \u00b1 0.01 \u00b5M and 0.2 \u00b1 0.07 \u00b5M, 224 respectively; t-test p=0.189). It should be noted that the dose-response curve shapes differ, with LysB-D29225    showing a sharp dose-dependent effect and stronger polysorbate 80-dependence than LysB-Ms6.To assess viability of growth-inhibited mycobacteria, several conditions at the high and low ends of the LysBp=1.6\u00b710 -5 ). Upon administration of 250 \u00b5M human lysozyme in presence of 0.05% PS80,230    viability was vigorously decreased after 4 days at 37 \u00b0C (10 3 cfu/well versus 10 7 cfu/well after sub-MIC treatment)231    and upon administration of the highest concentrations of LysB-Ms6 with 0.05% PS80, no viable Mtb were layered structure of the mycobacterial cell wall, we hypothesized that cell wall degrading enzymes235    can display synergy if administered jointly. Using Combenefit 41 we analysed various combinations of 236 antimycobacterial compounds in checkerboard assays(Table 3). The three tested compound combinations scoring 237 highest for synergy were selected for in-depth analysis: LysB-Ms6 with human lysozyme and 0.05% polysorbate 238 80, and LysB-Ms6 with \u03b1-amylase in presence or absence of 0.05% polysorbate 80. When LysB-Ms6 was combined 239 with either human lysozyme or A. oryzae \u03b1-amylase, both synergistic and antagonistic regions were observed in 240 the dose-response surface with few significant combinations and an overall neutral effect (Figure 4a-b). However, 241 when 0.05% polysorbate 80 was added to the combination of LysB-Ms6 and A. oryzae \u03b1-amylase, the shape of the 242 dose-response surface changed drastically, displaying a deep valley of synergy in which 18 out of 36 conditions 243 scored significant for synergy (p<0.05 to p<0.0001; Figure 4c). 244 The significance of synergy between LysB-Ms6, \u03b1-amylase and polysorbate 80 was further assessed by applying a 245 linear mixed model to bioluminescence data of two sets of drug combinations (Figure 4d-e, details in 246 Supplementary E). In presence of 0.05% polysorbate 80, a significant interaction (p=0.012 in the mixed model) 247 was identified between a dilution series of LysB-Ms6 and 7.8 \u00b5M \u03b1-amylase, confirming synergy (Figure 4e). In 248 absence of polysorbate 80, no such significant interaction was observed. In the presence of 3.9 \u00b5M \u03b1-amylase (Figure 4d) a similar trend was observed but it was of borderline significance (p=0.058 in the mixed model). From 250 combined results of bioluminescence assays and synergy analyses, we conclude that the combination of dilution 251 series of LysB-Ms6 and A. oryzae \u03b1-amylase in the presence of 0.05% polysorbate 80 leads to a strong, synergistic 252 effect on the growth of Mtb mc 2 7902, validating the hypothesis that targeting multiple layers of the cell wall of this study can be summarized as a methodological improvement in anti-Mtb drug screening, and a 256 main discovery with regard to the synergistic antimycobacterial effect of cell wall-degrading enzymes. 257 The methodological improvement pertains to the rather mundane, but vexing problem that Mtb grows in clumps 258 when its cell envelope is left unperturbed. While adding surfactants in high-throughput microtiterplate-based 259 drug studies enables spectrophotometry-based readouts of growth, it likely invalidates susceptibility tests of cell 260 wall-targeting enzymes and drugs, as accessibility to the cell wall substrates of such enzymes will be altered -261 which we confirmed in our studies. Other researchers have deferred to the use of model organism M. smegmatis, 262 which clumps less, grows more rapidly than Mtb and is non-infectious, allowing work outside highly restricted and 263 expensive biosafety level 3 laboratories. Nevertheless, the cell wall of M. smegmatis differs significantly from that 264 of the pathogenic slow-growing mycobacteria and it is questionable whether results can be extrapolated to Mtb. 265 For this reason, we resorted to the use of Mtb engineered with a bacterial lux operon. In a parallel project, other 266 luciferase systems were also implemented, and whereas higher specific luminescence could be obtained with 267 firefly luciferase, the bacterial lux operon does not require addition of the luciferin cofactor. This is a major 268 advantage, as it eliminates doubts about false results caused by bacterial clumping limiting cofactor diffusion, or 269 cell wall degrading enzyme treatment 'opening up' access for such cofactor. Moreover, we combined this system 270 with biosafety convenience by implementing it in a triple auxotrophic Mtb derivative generated in and generously 271 provided by the Jacobs lab. 33 The luminescent auxotrophic Mtb strain and associated protocols should strain, we discovered that the combination of LysB-Ms6 and A. oryzae \u03b1-amylase was highly synergistic 274 in inhibiting mycobacterial growth in presence of polysorbate 80. Remarkably, \u03b1-amylase itself has no anti-Mtb 275 effect either with or without 0.05% polysorbate 80. The most straightforward explanation is that polysorbate 80 276 and \u03b1-amylase collaborate in disrupting the \u03b1-glucan capsule (non-essential for in vitro Mtb growth), 11 clearing 277 the way for LysB to hydrolyze the linkage between underlying mycolic acids and the arabinogalactan layer, thus 278 disrupting the mycomembrane. This finding lays the first stone for the creation of specifically tailored 279 antimycobacterial (fusion) enzymes. 280 The anti-Mtb potential of LysB-Ms6 itself and its improvement in the presence of polysorbate 80 had already been 281 shown on the M. smegmatis model, and it was demonstrated that cell wall hydrolysis was the main mechanism 282 behind inhibitory activity of LysB-Ms6. 31 We report a similar surfactant-dependent bacteriostatic effect of both 283 LysB-Ms6 and LysB-D29 on Mtb. 284 The mycobacterial cell envelope is a complex non-proteinaceous (thus not directly genetically encoded) structure 285 synthesized by an extensive enzyme machinery. 7 This likely substantially reduces the chance that single 286 spontaneous mutations lead to resistance against enzyme antimicrobials, contrary to small molecule antibiotics, 287 which bind to genetically encoded protein targets. In addition, it has been observed that in treating MDR-TB 288 patients (the main target group for biopharmaceutical enzyme treatment), low-level antibiotics resistance can be 289 overcome by administrating drug doses exceeding the MICs of the resistant strains. 44 After weakening the 290 Mycobacterium envelope with cell-wall degrading enzymes, classic antibiotics could potentially penetrate more 291 readily, increasing the effective drug concentration intracytoplasmatically to levels above the MIC. 292While promising as antimycobacterials, adequate delivery of the enzyme therapeutics to the site of infection is 293 essential to therapeutic efficacy. We believe our study is timely as several inhaled nebulized enzyme therapeutics 294 are under clinical evaluation, providing evidence that lung delivery of therapeutic enzymes is feasible. 17,45 As an 295 example, it was calculated that 8.8\u00b11.9 mg of an antibody could be delivered to the alveoli of non-human primates 296 using a novel device for protein inhalation.46  Considering a conservative estimate of 70 ml lung lining fluid 297 volume, 47 this would amount to a dose of 0.13 mg/ml, or 4.3 \u00b5M of a 30-kDa protein, widely surpassing the MICs 298 we found for LysB in presence of surfactant (polysorbate 80, which has been successfully included in inhaled 299 therapeutics). 17,48 It should however be considered that mucus hypersecretion is a common feature of airway 300 inflammation, possibly lowering the effective therapeutic dose when treating (MDR-)TB patients. 49,50 While 301 optimizing lung delivery, topical application of antimycobacterial enzyme therapy might already suffice to treat 302 the skin infection Buruli ulcer caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. 51 303The repeated inhalation of non-human proteins might lead to an immune response, although tolerance is the 304 default response to antigens that come into contact with the mucosa in the deep airways. 52 If necessary, enzymes 305 could be administered in controlled-release formulations to reduce the number of administration required.306    Novel drug regimens have already drastically shortened (MDR-)TB therapy but still, duration, complexity and 307 toxicity of (second-line) drug regimens are main challenges in the worldwide fight to end TB. 1 Enhancing or 308 accelerating the effectiveness of conventional antibiotics by adding cell wall-degrading enzymes in two to three 309 rounds of (controlled-release) enzyme administration, could potentially lower the treatment duration critically 310 and help alleviate the immense burden of TB therapy.",

Previous studies on the use of cell wall degrading enzymes against Mycobacteria suffer from two main limitations.First, these studies often use Mycobacterium smegmatis as the test organism, a rather distant relative to Mtb,85    with known differences in cell wall composition. 27,28 This organism is non-infectious and grows very rapidly, hence 86 its popularity. However, for cell wall degrading antibiotics research the pathogen should be used. Second, Mtb 87 clumps heavily in cultures due to the composition of its cell wall. As this has precluded most high-throughput drug 88 test formats, the surfactant polysorbate 80 is routinely added to Mtb culture medium to support finely dispersed 89 planktonic growth. Polysorbate 80 does not restrict Mtb propagation in cultures that use glycerol as the carbon 90 source. 29,30 Still, it is known to alter mycobacterial drug susceptibility 31,32 and to destabilize the outer capsule. 11",
