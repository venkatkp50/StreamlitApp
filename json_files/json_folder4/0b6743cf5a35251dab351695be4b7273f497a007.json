'Self-reflective' questions and goal setting were viewed as essential components. The paper-based format, length, clarity, and time required were barriers to its use. Optional support considered within the aid was seen as important to motivate change. A digital version, integrated into patient record systems was regarded as critical to implementation. A revised 30-item aid was considered suitable for facilitating brief conversations and promoting patient autonomy.",

            "text": "Routine consultations in primary care settings present an important opportunity to target lifestyle behaviours. 1 Current UK guidelines recommend that health professionals identify patients who are not sufficiently active and offer support to encourage behaviour change. 2 Lifestyle advice can be of particular benefit to patients with established cardiovascular disease risk factors, including physical inactivity, poor diet, and obesity. [3] [4] [5] [6] However, these factors are infrequently discussed with patients in routine practice. 7 This is often attributed to limited organisational resources and time, as well as a need to address other issues during consultations. 8, 9 Effective, novel methods of delivery may be required to address these constraints. 10 Previous studies on the effectiveness of offering lifestyle advice in primary care have shown that though increases in physical activity can occur, these are short-term, and not sufficient to enable sustained behaviour change. 11 In a qualitative study of a tailored intervention to promote secondary cardiovascular risk reduction in general practice, the authors found many participants made only brief attempts at lifestyle changes. 12 Discussions on lifestyle change can be challenging to initiate, particularly around issues such as weight reduction, 13 and practitioner-patient priorities and expectations of conversations can also differ. 9, 14 SDM is a process in which clinicians actively involve patients to ensure support meets their individual preferences. [15] [16] [17] Decision aids have focused primarily on treatment or health screening options. [18] [19] [20] Less is known regarding their use in promoting behaviour change. Further, there is limited evidence that has reported on user-centred, iterative development of SDM aids, 21 which is imperative for decision-aids used for managing chronic conditions. An additional recommendation for the systematic development of decision aids is that they include a strong theoretical underpinning, 22 drawing on approaches including the 5A's model of brief behavioural counselling 23, 24 and the COM-B framework, 25, 26 which accounts for the influence of context on behaviour through consideration of capabilities, opportunities, motivation, and social, physical, and environmental factors. 26 The COM-B framework informed the design and development of SHARE-D, 27 a questionnaire-based aid, designed to facilitate SDM around lifestyle modification in patients with increased cardiovascular risk factors and to identify constraints and support that may be needed for making changes to diet and physical activity.",

The study team were provided with lists of eligible individuals from primary care settings within five NHS Trusts in Northern Ireland, academic primary care departments, two cardiovascular clinical interest groups, and a patient support group linked to a national charity (Northern Ireland Chest Heart and Stroke).

For example, the statement, 'I need other people to help me make lifestyle changes', could be rephrased as 'asking others for support can help me to make lifestyle changes', which may be more likely to evoke a positive response when someone is asked whether or not they agree. Patients were conscious of physical limitations or psychological morbidities demotivating efforts for lifestyle change, including musculoskeletal complaints, shortness of breath, chest pain, fear of recurrent cardiovascular events, and anxiety and depression. Participants discussed how patients could have different levels of motivation and beliefs or reasons for changing their physical activity or diet. It was suggested that these two lifestyle behaviours should be separated during discussions, as patients might respond differently to questions regarding each behaviour.

A number of GPs discussed how they would use tools such as QRISK3 with patients and 'screen share' to prompt discussions. The SHARE-D aid could be used in a similar manner. Some GPs and health professionals reported that the aid could be suitable for initiating discussions in response to abnormal test results, including elevated HbA1c or blood pressure. GPs also suggested it could be valuable during conversations with patients who are overweight. This was reflected in interviews that highlighted that, while weight was a topic that was often talked about during primary care consultations, SHARE-D could help in identifying support needed to make changes. Referring to some barriers to use that were identified (such as patients' current readiness to make lifestyle change), it was highlighted how the flexible and adaptable nature of the aid meant even brief information could be useful to patients at a later date. Participants also suggested how patients could initially go through the aid themselves, prior to a consultation in which it would be discussed with a health professional. The potential for using the aid during telephone or virtual consultations was also discussed. This was influenced by the interviews taking place early during the COVID-19 pandemic, when there was increased use of telephone consultations.

Individual interviews, focusing on these areas and on how SHARE-D could be most effectively delivered, pointed to it being suitable for initiating conversations following abnormal clinical findings and for promoting patient autonomy around healthy lifestyle choices. The support options provided, including a decision to discuss lifestyle change with others after a consultation, were seen as important. The aid was also regarded as useful for identifying potential barriers to engaging with lifestyle change, including fears around recurrent cardiovascular events, as well as musculoskeletal complaints associated with increased or unfamiliar levels of physical activity. Key barriers to use included structural and process issues such as the limited time during consultations and the paper-based format. Given workloads and time constraints in primary care, different approaches were suggested to improve implementation. This included developing a digital version that could be integrated into patient record systems.

Although participants were recruited primarily from one geographical area of the UK, recruitment was purposeful and individuals from a range of settings and characteristics participated, meaning that findings could be transferable in a wider context. One potential limitation is that a formal consensus method, such as the nominal group process or Delphi technique, was not used. However, the mixed-methods approach, including individual interviews, reflecting on both individual and collated survey data, may have allowed for greater exploration of patient views, and for all perspectives to be examined in more depth than would be feasible with other group-based methods. Some interviews were conducted 2-3 weeks after completion of the survey, so this may have influenced recall of the aid. A further limitation is that the authors did not assess health literacy levels and this factor may have impacted on the perspectives of participants in this study. Higher health literacy has been associated with better experiences during SDM and improved capability wellbeing, 33 which is the ability to do and be the things that matter to the individual. 34 Comparison with existing literature These findings accord with previous research that developed and tested the feasibility of the SHARE-D aid. 23 This study led to a consolidation and refinement of the core content of the aid and its presentation and use in primary care. The modifications that have been made to the aid as a consequence of the present study findings include reducing its length, simplifying content, and identifying acceptable approaches to its implementation. A reduction in the content of the SDM aid was made based on the level of agreement on item inclusion. An important consideration is that this could potentially moderate the efficacy of the aid. However, care was taken to ensure that modifications were reflective of patient and healthcare professional expert panel member perspectives and retained core components of the aid, particularly those related to international SDM tool development standards. 35 This is particularly important for SDM aids used in primary care, since reducing content might have benefits in terms of improving the implementation, usability, and acceptability of a tool, relative to a more complex, in-depth tool. 36 There may also be important differences SDM tools used for treatment choice decisions made in secondary care settings and those based around supporting chronic disease self-management, including lifestyle change approaches.",

            "text": "SHARE-D provides a meaningful structure for a focused discussion about lifestyle change in a time-efficient way that could support implementation in general practice. As a part of the 'making every contact count' approach, NHS and general practice policy recommendations encourage the discussion of lifestyle change during routine patient interactions. [37] [38] [39] One study has indicated that discussion aids can be successful in modifying conversations in primary care, leading to an increased number of discussions around physical activity, diet, and medications. 40 In the present study, health professionals were keen to have lifestyle change discussions with patients and saw the value of doing so. Most felt equipped to initiate conversations, and felt they were sufficiently knowledgeable about current dietary advice guidelines and recommended levels of physical activity for patients with increased cardiovascular risk factors. Similar findings were reported in studies where primary care physicians reported having adequate knowledge and understanding about the health benefits for patients associated with achieving recommended levels of physical activity, 41 even though other work has demonstrated that physical activity is less likely to be discussed with patients compared to other modifiable factors, such as smoking or blood pressure. 42 While there is evidence to suggest that brief interventions can be effective in producing small but significant behavioural changes in patients, 43 behaviour change conversations around physical activity can be challenging. 1, 44 Thus, standardised training may be necessary to provide clinicians with effective, evidence-based skills. 45, 46 Health professionals in the present study emphasised factors that limited the opportunity to have conversations about lifestyle, acknowledging that they often felt they lacked information on support options or resources to which patients might be referred, including details of local exercise groups or other relevant community-based organisations. Specific training in SDM and its use in managing chronic conditions have been suggested as potential components for decision aid standards. 35 These findings also highlight the importance of involving patients in decisions about their own lifestyle to promote autonomy. Primary care patients' knowledge, self-efficacy, perceived support from others. and perception that their choices and decisions were being taken into account have been identified as core factors influencing the adoption of healthy lifestyle change. [47] [48] [49] [50] This finding is in line with current draft National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines that underline the importance of discussing risks, benefits, and consequences of care choices so that patients can make informed decisions. 51 This guidance emphasises how decision making can take place before, during, and after appointments, and recommendations have been made to improve awareness, patient activation, and to embed SDM at an organisational level. 51, 52 This process may be facilitated by use of non-complex tools that integrate with existing clinic workflows, and which prompt users to engage so that they fully understand the role of SDM and are at ease with having brief but open discussions about lifestyle change. 53 In this context, it is also important to ensure that the use of decision aids is equitable. There is evidence that regardless of multimorbidity, primary care patients in more deprived geographical areas have shorter consultation times; 54, 55 however, it has been demonstrated that allowing more time can be associated with increased patient autonomy and ability to self-manage conditions. 56 It is therefore recommended that longer appointments, particularly for patients in areas of higher deprivation, are facilitated, 57 and the brief and flexible nature of the SHARE-D aid supports this approach.",

Development of a digital version of the aid and use by other practice staff could minimise the impact on GP workloads.

One potential option would be to link the aid to EHR systems. The impact of SDM aids delivered via EHRs has previously been shown to be feasible and acceptable to users for the management of long-term conditions in a primary care context. 58 Use of EHR-linked patient portals has also been associated with observed improvements in health status monitoring, patient-doctor interactions, overall care quality, and patient satisfaction around decision making; 59-61 however, utilisation with these digital approaches in these studies may have been more closely associated with increased patient age profiles and with female sex.",
