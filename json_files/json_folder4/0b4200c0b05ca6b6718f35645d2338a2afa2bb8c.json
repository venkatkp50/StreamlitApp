SSBs may affect child health during a sensitive period [2] . Although our previous research showed a relationship between SSBs and metabolic index in childhood [3] , chronic diseases are seldom present at such young age. According to a German study, clinical symptom complaints are common among school-aged children [4] . Another study indicated that symptoms such as medically unexplained abdominal pain and headache contributed to more than half of school absences [5] , highly impacting academic performance [6] . It is unclear how these medically unexplained symptoms occurred, but diet advice may affect medically unsolved symptoms in childhood [7] , indicating that these symptoms could be related to food.",

            "text": "SSBs consumption is related to inflammation, as large amounts of dietary sugars increase tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) levels [8] , a higher cortisol release [9] , and higher other inflammatory cytokine levels [10] . An intervention study among children who had nasal congestion symptoms showed that decreased SSB consumption was related to significantly reduced proinflammatory markers and increased anti-inflammatory markers, as well as symptom improvements [11] , which indicated a possible mechanism by which SSBs are related to symptom complaints. On the other hand, high SSB consumption is correlated with mood disorders, such as a higher risk for depression [12] , while mood disorders are also related to somatic symptom complaints [13] [14] [15] . Thus, mood disorders could be the potential mechanism of the SSBs-somatic symptom complaints association. We hypothesize that higher consumption of SSBs among children is associated with more symptom complaints, such as fever and abdominal pain, and we aim to confirm the association in a large sample size population-based study. Data from children aged 6-17 years who consumed SSBs were collected in the autumn semester, while symptom complaints were collected in the following spring semester via school classes. The amount and frequency of SSB consumption were explored by generalized linear models to clarify their potential relationship with symptom complaints. This study adds to the literature by studying SSBs and negative health outcomes among children, using data from a national survey in China. In addition, we established multilayer models; socio-demographic factors; lifestyle, including physical activity, sedentary time, sleep; and early life factors, including whether low birthweight and breastfeeding were adjusted step-by-step, in order to eliminate potential cofounders.",

Multistage stratified cluster random sampling was conducted, and all children and their parents who agreed to join the study were asked to answer a questionnaire containing lifestyle information in the autumn semester of 2013 (September to November), as well as answer a questionnaire that retrospectively collected symptoms in the spring semester 2014. In total, there were 62,517 children aged 6-17 who agreed to participate in the intervention study, and the whole sample of this research came from 29,028 children in the control group. Children were excluded if they lacked data on sugar-sweetened beverage intake (SSBs, n = 4238), symptoms (n = 2505), socio-demographic information (n = 4426), physical activity/sedentary behavior or sleep duration (n = 2817), and breastfeeding/birthweight (n = 2689). There were 12,454 children included in the final analysis ( Figure 1 ). This study was approved by the Sun Yat-sen University Ethics Committee, and all parents/guardians of the children signed the informed consent.",

Finally, sugar-sweetened beverage intake frequency/amount was introduced in adjusted model 3, depending on the outcome. p-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Depending on whether clinical symptom complaints were medically explained (such as infection) or unexplained (functional, which could not be explained by any physical diseases), we explain these associations separately. Referring to clinical symptoms explained by physically related disease, the large sugar content in SSBs provides a higher glycemic index (GI) compared with other liquids [20] . An animal model showed that high glucose levels exacerbate inflammatory effects through the activation of cytokines, such as transforming growth factor (TGF) and the promotion of Th17 cell differentiation [10] and dysregulated immunity homeostasis [21] . Even in terms of the most frequently mentioned chronic diseases in relation to SSBs, obesity and systematic inflammation have been widely observed [22] . Moreover, SSB-related hyperglycemia is associated with infection and its clinically related symptoms [23] . As fever, headache, abdominal pain, etc., were also symptoms [24] , SSB consumption may affect symptoms by inducing infection or chronic systemic inflammation; however, this speculation requires confirmation.",

Sugar-sweetened beverage collection did not exclude nonnutritive sweeteners, which compromised a more solid conclusion regarding sugar and the relationship with symptom complaints. We did not include the consumption of other sweet products; thus, we cannot address the effects of total sugar consumption on symptom complaints. Body mass index or other indicators that could represent weight status were not included in the study; thus, we could not know whether the association between SSBs and symptoms are affected by body weight. The data collection was performed in 2013-2014, and therefore only represents a situation from 7 years ago. Data regarding SSB consumption patterns were collected 6 months before data regarding symptom complaints, and the consumption patterns could have changed during the interim period.
