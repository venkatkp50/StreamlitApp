Imaging diagnostics, especially high-resolution computed tomography, is a diagnostic method widely used in the diagnosis of this disease. It is important to emphasize that not only SARS-CoV-2 infection may manifest as interstitial pneumonia. Other diseases such as other viral, fungal, atypical bacterial pneumonia, autoimmune process, and even cancer can also manifest as ground-glass opacities or consolidations in the imaging of the lungs. In this case report, we described a patient who manifested many symptoms that seemed to be COVID-19. However, all performed antigen and polymerase chain reaction tests were negative. The diagnostics must have been extended. Microbiological and mycological blood cultures and sputum cultures were performed. Blood cultures were negative but in sputum, Candida albicans and Candida glabrata were identified. Targeted therapy with fluconazole was implemented with a satisfactory result. The patient was discharged from the hospital in a good general condition with no complaints.",

It is believed that the virus is acquired from a zoonotic source and is transmitted via airborne respiratory droplets [2] . The symptomatic phase, except for respiratory problems, manifests with fever, myalgia, and smell or taste disorders. The infection may be detected by a rapid antigen test; however, a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is needed to confirm the diagnosis [3, 4] . The specific image of the lungs in high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) could be a useful diagnostic tool in the differential diagnosis. Many studies have also investigated the relationship between lung computerized tomography (CT) scans and patients' prognosis [5, 6] . Typical radiological manifestations presented in HRCT include ground-glass opacities (GGO), consolidations, crazy-paving, and reticular patterns [7] .",
