All included patients had previously undergone polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2, which confirmed their infection with a mean cycle threshold (Ct) value of 18.46 \u00b1 3.8 (12-26).",

Regarding their COVID-19 symptoms, two patients (15.4%) had persistent fever, four (30.8%) had ageusia, and two (15.4%) had anosmia. The majority of them (69.2%) had a mild course of SARS-CoV-2 infection and were prescribed paracetamol (PCM); contrarily, four patients experienced a moderate course of infection -two patients (15.4%) were prescribed chloroquine and other two (15.4%) were prescribed dexamethasone. 3 The mean onset of mucositis emergence was 0.85 \u00b1 0.8 (0-2) days calculated since the day of PCR testing, while its mean duration was 8.62 \u00b1 3.07 (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) days. An 11-item numerical rating scale (NRS) was used to evaluate the manifested intraoral pain where \"0\" denotes \"no pain\" and \"10\" denotes \"pain as bad as you can imagine\". 4 The mean score of pain intensity was 5.08 \u00b1 2.36 (3-9). On intraoral examination, sporadic erythema with minor irritations was found all over the mouth (53.8%), on the buccal mucosa (30.8%), palate (15.4%), and gingiva (7.7%). Depapillation of the tongue was observed in all cases with a tendency to be more localized at the borders (Figure 1 ). This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",
