Previous in vivo observational studies have presented conflicting results, though recent randomized clinical trials have reported no benefit from HCQ amongst hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We examined the effects of HCQ alone, and in combination with azithromycin, in a hospitalized COVID-19 positive, United States (US) Veteran population using a propensity score adjusted survival analysis with imputation of missing data. From March 1, 2020 through April 30, 2020, 64,055 US Veterans were tested for COVID-19 based on Veteran Affairs Healthcare Administration electronic health record data. Of the 7,193 positive cases, 2,809 were hospitalized, and 657 individuals were prescribed HCQ within the first 48-hours of hospitalization for the treatment of COVID-19. There was no apparent benefit associated with HCQ receipt, alone or in combination with azithromycin, and an increased risk of intubation when used in combination with azithromycin [Hazard Ratio (95% Confidence Interval): 1.55 (1.07, 2.24)]. In conclusion, we assessed the effectiveness of HCQ with or without azithromycin in treating patients hospitalized with COVID-19 using a national sample of the US Veteran population.",

From March 1, 2020 through April 30, 2020, 64,055 US Veterans were tested for COVID-19 based on Veteran Affairs Healthcare Administration electronic health record data. Of the 7,193 positive cases, 2,809 were hospitalized, and 657 individuals were prescribed HCQ within the first 48-hours of hospitalization for the treatment of COVID-19. There was no apparent benefit associated with HCQ receipt, alone or in combination with azithromycin, and an increased risk of intubation when used in combination with azithromycin [Hazard Ratio (95% Confidence Interval): 1.55 (1.07, 2.24)].

Non-Hispanic blacks were more likely to receive at least one treatment than other race/ethnicity groups, and those in urban settings were more likely to be prescribed some form of HCQ. Those coming from long-term care or nursing facilities were less likely to initiate either treatment within the first 48 hours of admission.Acute laboratory measurements, such as lactate dehydrogenase and C-reactive protein, were more commonly available on those initiating both treatments.Before weighting, the exposure groups differed with respect to multiple covariates(Table 1). Overall, the GBM was able to balance a large majority of thevariables in the primary analysis model. Complete love and balance plots can be found in Web Figures 2-15. The week of admission variable did not achieve the recommended threshold of 0.1(47), nor even 0.2 for the average standardized mean difference comparing those initiating Both treatments to any of the others. Similarly, the average standardized mean difference for week of admission comparing HCQ alone to Neither or azithromycin alone groups was approximately 0.2. Figure 4 displays the average relative importance or influence of a given predictor in the primary propensity model. Notably total station size and week of admission were the most important factors across all imputations and sensitivity analyses (Web Figures 16-18).

Comparing those exposed to HCQ alone versus neither treatment in the 48 hours following admission, there were non-statistically significant increased risks of both mortality within 30 days of index (HR=1.21, 95% CI: 0.82, 1.76) and intubation within 21 days of index (HR=1.33, 95% CI: 0.82, 2.15).

Given that 11% of the sample added one or more of the treatments in the 24-48 hour window, our use of the 48-hour window may be preferable as it more effectively avoids misclassification. We excluded individuals who died, were intubated, or discharged within the 48 hours, because the patients would not have had enough time to experience benefit or harm from HCQ. While this ensured the circumvention of immortal time bias when defining the group with neither treatment, we recognize that this may present additional limitations.Our results may not generalize to those intubated prior to receiving treatment nor to those with less severe illness who are discharged almost immediately. Compared to the overall US population, VA users are older, mostly male, with more comorbidities and lower socioeconomic status(55). Our results may differ from studies of younger and healthier populations with a higher proportion of women. However, older, male and sicker individuals are at higher risk for severe COVID-19, which warranted the study of this drug early-on, despite historical data indicating that these might also be the individuals most at risk for adverse events from HCQ (3).",
