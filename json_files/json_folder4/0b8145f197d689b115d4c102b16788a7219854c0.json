Due to different harvest times and processing methods, FF can be divided into \"Qingqiao\" and \"Laoqiao\". Clinically, \"Qingqiao\" is used more frequently (Guo et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2019) . At present, 321 chemical components have been isolated from FF, including phenylethanoid glycosides, lignans, flavonoids, terpenes and volatile oils (Dong et al., 2017) . Modern Chinese Medicine studies have found that most of these substances have pharmacological activity (Wang et al., 2018) . Forsythiaside A is a phenylethanoid glycoside and it shows remarkable antiinflammation, antivirus, neuroprotection, antioxidant, hepatoprotection, and antibacterial activity . Forsythin, a lignan substance, mitigates apoptosis and oxidative stress (Du et al., 2020) , has anti-viral and anti-inflammatory activity (Ma et al., 2020) , and improves insulin resistance (Xu et al., 2019) . Rutin is a flavonoid compound with many pharmacological effects, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, neuroprotective (Chua, 2013) , vascular protection (Stanely and Priya, 2010) , and anti-cancer (Ben et al., 2016) . The volatile oil of FF is a primary activeone of the main pharmacological components and has the effects of antiviral, antibacterial, antioxidant (Jiao et al., 2012) , anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, acaricidal (Lee and Lee, 2015) . The basis of the heat-clearing effect of FF in Chinese medicine prescriptions is the antiinflammatory and antioxidant properties. The detoxification effect is attributed to its antibacterial, antiviral and anticancer activities (Wang et al., 2018) . Based on this, FF is the main active ingredient in many widely used classic Chinese patent medicine prescriptions, such as Shuanghuanglian injections (Zhou et al., 2011) and Lianhua Qingwen granules (Hu et al., 2021) . Lianhua Qingwen is also recommended for the treatment of COVID 19 (Hu et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021) . Because FF is widely used, it is necessary to conduct research on this product and its pharmacologically active substances.",

            "text": "The pharmacologically active substances in FF are secondary metabolites. Plant growth, development and reproduction are achieved through material metabolism. Secondary metabolism produces compounds that are often involved in ecological interactions and include pigments, scents, and antibiotics. Secondary metabolites are used in medicine, food, dyes, and agriculture (Srivastava and Srivastava, 2007) . Plant-derived medicinal secondary metabolites are mainly obtained by direct extraction from plants. However, to produce such compounds on a large scale would require medicinal crops to be grown extensively and most are currently not well suited to production agriculture. Also, the content of medicinal secondary metabolites in plants is low and extraction and separation are difficult. New production methods are being adopted, including extraction from plant tissue cell culture and the use of microbial cell factories for production (Jiang et al., 2021) . The use of artificial microbial cell factories is considered feasible, and this approach has been used for the antimalarial drug artemisinin (Ro et al., 2006) , the analgesic drug morphine (Thodey et al., 2014) , the antitumor drug paclitaxel (Chen et al., 2019) , the cardiovascular disease drug tanshinone (Yadav et al., 2020) , and other aromatic secondary products. Efficient synthesis of metabolites is an important prerequisite for constructing a microbial cell factory for the secondary metabolites of FF and realizing efficient utilization of FF. The biosynthetic pathway analysis of secondary metabolites is an important prerequisite to improved production methods. Jiao et al. (2013) found that the oil yield of FF's seeds is about 30% and showed that FF seeds have great potential as a biodiesel raw material resource. FF's contain volatile oils, flavonols, anthocyanins, \u03b2-pinene and other compounds. The synthesis and metabolism of secondary metabolites are mostly related to lipids. Abscisic acid (ABA) is insoluble in water. As a plant hormone, it has physiological functions that include causing bud dormancy, leaf shedding, and inhibiting cell growth, and ABA can promote flavonoid metabolism. Lipid metabolism is a key process in energy homeostasis, carbon storage, membrane structure, cell signaling, transcription and translation regulation, and cell and protein interactions (Chapman and Feussner, 2016) . Therefore, lipids play an important role in plant growth, development, and reproduction (Chapman and Feussner, 2016) . Lipids are unique and functionally specific compared to other metabolites. Therefore, lipid composition and abundance can be used to monitor changes in plants over time and their response to specific stimuli. The lipid components of FF have not been fully studied. Because of the importance of these compounds, a comprehensive analysis and comparison of them in FF is needed. Clarifying the biosynthetic pathways and regulation methods of secondary metabolites in FF will be useful for stabilizing and improving this important product. The content of secondary metabolites, the improvement of the quality of medicinal materials, and the biological preparation technology of secondary metabolites are of great significance. Lipidomics deals with lipids and lipid interactions in biological systems. Lipidomic analysis methods include chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry-based analysis methods. Liquid chromatographymass spectrometry is currently the most widely used method for lipidomics research. Chromatography mass spectrometry uses the separation ability of chromatography and the high sensitivity of mass spectrometry to achieve in-depth analysis of lipids (Xu et al., 2020) . To identify and quantify all lipid components in FF and systematically analyze the lipid composition and expression changes in the growth process of FF, the present study applied high-resolution liquid phase tandem mass spectrometry technology for lipidomic analysis.",

This study makes use of transcriptomics and lipidomics methods to 1) determine the lipid composition of FF over time during normal growth, and 2) screen candidate genes related to the synthesis of lipid secondary metabolites. Results can provide a reference for increasing the content of secondary metabolites in FF, breeding high-quality FF varieties, and realizing large-scale production of secondary metabolites.",

There were five pathways in total. Isoprene is produced by the mevalonate (MVA) and methyl erythritol phosphate (MEP) pathways in the terpene backbone biosynthesis pathway (Ko00900), and 9 DEGs were involved in regulation of these. The MVA pathway starts from 2 acetyl CoA which is catalyzed by AACT and HMGS to obtain 3hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA. This substance is catalyzed by 3hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR, EC: 1.1.1.34) to Frontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org October 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 758326 9 produce MVA, which undergoes phosphorylation and decarboxylation to produce Isopentenyl-PP (IPP). HMGR is upregulated during plant growth and promotes the formation of terpenoid skeletons through the MVA pathway. The MEP pathway, which starts with a condensation reaction between pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate followed by a condensation reaction catalyzed by 1-deosy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (EC:2.2.1.7), generates 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate, 2-C-methyl-d- Frontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org October 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 758326 10 (FPP) under the catalysis of EC: 2.5.1.10. FPP will form geranyl geranyl-PP (GGPP) under the catalysis of EC: 2.5.1.29 with another IPP. IPP, DMAPP, FPP, GPP, GGPP, and other substances are the starting materials to produce terpenoids with different structures and are the backbone of terpenoids. GPP is the precursor of monoterpenes and enters the monoterpenoid biosynthetic pathway (Ko00902). FPP is the precursor of sesquiterpenes and triterpenes and enters the sesquiterpene and triterpenoid biosynthesis pathway (Ko00909). GGPP is a diterpene. The precursors of tetraterpene and tetraterpene enter the diterpene biosynthesis pathway (Ko00904) and the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway (Ko00906), respectively. Gibberellins (GAs) are diterpenoids, and there are five genes involved in their synthesis in the Ko00904 pathway. GGPP is regulated by the gene ent-copayl diphosphate synthase (CPS, EC: 5.5.1.13) in the plastid to generate entcopalyl-PP, and its expression was downregulated and then regulated by the gene ent-kaurene synthase (KS, EC: 4.2.3.19) to generate ent-Kaur-16-ene. KS expression was upregulated. Ent-Kaur-16-ene undergoes a multi-step enzymatic reaction in the endoplasmic reticulum to generate GA12-aldehyde. GA12aldehyde is regulated by different genes to generate GAs. GA 12 produces GA 24 and GA 9 under the regulation of EC: 1.14.11.12, GA 9 produces GA 4 under the regulation of EC: 1.14.11.15, and GA 4 is regulated by the gene EC: 1.14.11.13 to synthesize GA 34 . Among the GAs on FF, the content of GA 36 was the highest, and it is metabolized by two pathways, GA 24 and GA 37 , and can generate GA 4 under the action of P450 enzymes. GA 8 and GA 8 -catabolite are metabolites of GA 1 , and EC: 1.14.11.13 are genes that regulate the metabolism of active GAs. In the Ko00906 pathway, GGPP generates carotene, lutein, and other tetraterpenoids through a series of complex regulatory reactions. Carotene and lutein can absorb light energy and participate in photosynthesis and abscisic acid is a signal of seed maturation and stress resistance. Hormones are synthesized via carotenoid metabolism. Differential genes EC:1.14.14.137, EC:1.13.11.51 and EC: 1.1.1.288 are involved in the regulation of abscisic acid metabolism (Figure 8) .",

CHA is a branch point, l-phenylalanine (L-Phe), l-tyrosine (L-Tyr), l-tryptophan (l-tryptophan, L-Trp) of the aromatic amino acids participate in different branch pathways. PheA catalyzes the production of phenylpyruvate, which is catalyzed by amino acid transaminase to obtain L-Phe. TyrA catalyzes the conversion of pre-benzoic acid to 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, which is then catalyzed by transaminase to obtain L-Tyr. The synthesis pathway of tryptophan is more complicated, starting with chorismate, and generating L-Trp under the catalysis of TrpEG, TrpD, TrpF, TrpC, TrpA and TrpB. l-phenylalanine is produced by the action of phenylalanine lyase, hydroxylase, and CoA ligase to produce 4-coumayl-CoA, which is produced by chalcone synthase (CHI) and flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H) to form dihydroflavonoids. Dihydroflavonols are important precursors of other flavonoids. They are catalyzed by flavonol synthase (FLS), dihydroflavonol 4reductase (DFR), and anthocyanidin synthase (ANS).

For the first time, it was determined that the FF contains 5,802 lipids and that the content of lipid components with pharmacological activity was relatively low. Comparing the lipid changes of FF during the two growth periods in May and July, the content of 139 lipid types changed significantly. Different lipid secondary metabolites are mainly concentrated in pregnenolones and polyvinyls, among which the content of chalcone, dihydrolone, flavanone, flavonol and mactraxanthin 3-(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z, 17Z-eicosapentaenoate) 3\u2032-palmitoleate increased, while the content of afzelechin 7-O-\u03b2-dapiofuranoside, 4\u03b2-(2,4-dihydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl) fisetinidol, and others decreased.

(2017) found that the average content of volatile oil in FF was as high as 3.27%, containing \u03b1-pinene, \u03b2-pinene, limonene, phellandrene, cymene, linalool and terpine-4-ol (Sun et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2014) . The results of the present study show that FF contains rosin alcohol, fumagillin, hydroxy camphor, and other substances, as well as plant hormones such as abscisic acid gibberellin. The terpenoid structural unit is transformed from the MVA and MEP pathways to generate IPP and its isomer DMAPP. The present study found that the synthesis of the terpenoid skeleton of FF is dominated by the MEP pathway and the pathway is regulated by genes EC: 2.2.1.7 and EC: 2.7.7.60. Plant hormones are closely related to the growth process of plants. ABA, also known as dormant or abscisin, causes dormancy of buds, shedding of leaves and inhibition of cell growth. Mass spectrometry detected no significant difference in the content of 7\u2032-hydroxyabscisic acid and (+)-8\u2032-hydroxyabscisic acid. Genes EC: 1.1.1.288, EC: 1.14.14.137 and EC: 1.13.11.51 jointly regulate the metabolism of abscisic acid, which may be related to the growth and development stage of FF when harvested. Abscisic acid is balanced under the dynamic regulation of the three genes state. ABA is synthesized by carotene, and the content of carotene decreases significantly, possibly due to the production of abscisic acid. Gibberellin is a diterpenoid compound with diverse structures, some of which are easily soluble in water and only a few substances have intrinsic activity controlling all aspects of plant growth and development (including seed germination, stem elongation, leaf expansion, flowering and seed development) (Hedden, 2020) . GA 1 , GA 3 , GA 4 and GA 7 have biological activity. The 6 GAs identified were non-biologically active substances. GA 36 had the most abundant content and is the precursor of active gibberellin GA 4 , which may be transformed into an active state under the control of GA 20 -oxidase (GA20ox, EC: 1.14.11.12) and GA 3 -oxidase (GA3ox, EC: 1.14.11.15). At the same time, GA 8 and its metabolites, which are the metabolites of GA 1 , may be metabolic genes in (EC: 1.14.11.13), the gene c83901. graph_c3 was upregulated to promote the catabolism of active GAs and c63052. graph_c0 was downregulated to inhibit the decomposition of active GAs. In short, gibberellin has a high content in July in Qingqiao, and its metabolism was active, which fits with it being an important substance for fruit development.",

            "text": "Flavonoids play are important for attracting insect pollinators, resisting ultraviolet rays, and enhancing disease resistance (Onkokesung et al., 2014) in plants (Agati et al., 2012) . Flavonoids have various biological activities (Ullah et al., 2020) such as antibacterial, antiviral, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and hypoglycemic activity (Cazarolli et al., 2006) . Studies (Hoshino et al., 1999) have reported that the antibacterial effects of certain flavonoid complexes are related to their oxidative division of DNA or damage to bacterial cell membranes. Wang et al. (2004) found that baicalin inhibited HIV-1 induced syncytium formation and HIV-1 p24 antigen and RT product produced antiviral effects. Pereira et al. (2007) found that naringin can significantly reduce the nitrite content and the amount of inflammatory cells in the macrophage inflammation model (Yang et al., 2015; Nishioka et al., 1998) . Flavonoids are based on the C6-C3-C6 structure, and include anthocyanins, flavonoids, flavonols and isoflavones. Pinocembrin, naringenin and eriodictyol are the precursors of other flavonoid derivatives. There are some key enzymes in the de novo synthesis of flavonoids. ACCase (acetyl CoA carboxylase) has a wide range of functions, which can guide the flow of carbon from photosynthesis Frontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org October 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 758326 to primary and secondary metabolites. Among these enzymes, MF (multifunctional) guides the biosynthesis of very long-chain fatty acids and flavonoids in the cytoplasm. PAL is the entrance enzyme of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis . Hu et al. (2011) used a competitive inhibitor 2-aminoindan-2-phosphonic acid (AIP) to specifically inhibit PAL activity in Cistanche suspension cells and found that the content of phenylethanol glycosides was significantly reduced. In the phenylpropane pathway, CHS is a key enzyme in the synthesis of flavonoids, leading the central pathway of phenylpropane metabolism to the branch of flavonoid synthesis. The results of the present study showed that when the expression of anthocyanidin synthase (ANS, EC: 1.14.20.4) was upregulated, afzelechin 7-O-\u03b2-d-apiofuranoside was significantly reduced. This result may be due to the conversion of afzelechin from leucopelargonidin, and ANS can promote the metabolism of leucopelargonidin into dihydrokaempferol and pelargondin, which indirectly leads to a decrease in the synthesis of afzelechin. Perhaps ANS is an inhibitory enzyme of afzelechin synthesis. In addition, the content of quercetin 7,3\u2032,4\u2032-trimethyl ether 3rhamnoside (quercetin 7,3\u2032,4\u2032-trimethyl ether 3-rhamnoside) increased significantly, and there were two influencing factors. On the one hand, the upregulation of ANS expression promotes the conversion of leucocyanidin to dihydroquercetin, which is the precursor of quercetin 7,3\u2032,4\u2032-trimethyl ether 3-rhamnoside. On the other hand, the downregulation of flavonol synthase (FLS, EC: 1.14.20.6) (Park et al., 2019) inhibits the oxidation reaction of dihydrokaempferol, dihydroquercetin and dihydromyricetin. FLS is the key enzyme for the conversion of dihydrokaempferol, dihydroquercetin, and dihydromyricetin to pelargonidin, quercetin, and myricetin. The significant reduction of myricetin 7-glucoside again confirms the effect of FLS. Park et al. isolated the OsFLS gene from rice and showed that the OsFLS gene has both flavonol synthase and flavanone 3-hydroxylase activity, which is consistent with the results of the present study. There are also pharmacologically active substances in FF, such as phenethanol glycosides and lignans, which originate from the shikimic acid pathway and are homologous to flavonoids (Sun et al., 2018) . The results showed that the phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine synthesis pathway (Ko00400), phenylalanine metabolism pathway (Ko00360), the tyrosine synthesis pathway (Ko00350) and the phenylpropane synthesis pathway (Ko00940), and the activity of anthocyanin synthesis pathway (Ko00942), both peaked and declined. The downregulation of these pathways is closely related to the synthesis of active secondary metabolites such as phenethyl alcohol glycosides, lignin, and flavonoids indicating that the accumulation of secondary metabolites reaches the peak during the maturation period of FF in July, when the crop is ready to harvest. The chemical composition and pharmacological effects of Laoqiao and Qingqiao harvested 1 month later differ greatly. Cui et al. (2010) found that the different maturity of FF determines the concentration of chemical substances. Jia et al. (2015) found that forsythin A, forsythin C, cornoside, rutin, forsythin and the gallic acid content is higher than Laoqiao. Bao et al. (2017) found that the anti-tumor activity of Laoqiao on B16-F10 mouse melanoma was significantly weaker than that of Qingqiao. Over time the content of secondary metabolites in FF will gradually decrease and the related pharmacological effects will gradually weaken. During harvesting and processing of FF, a special treatment called \"shaqing\" is required before Qingqiao is used as a medicine. Shaqing, via steaming, boiling and other processes can destroy the metabolic enzymes (Wu et al., 2019) in FF, so that the active substances are retained. Laoqiao is used as medicine only when dried, which is one of the reasons why Laoqiao and Qingqiao have different active ingredients and effects. The best period for harvesting medicinal plants should be the peak period of synthesis and accumulation of secondary metabolites. Traditional Chinese medicine classics and the Chinese Pharmacopoeia record July to August as the harvesting period of Qingqiao. The transcriptome results of FF in July showed that the DEGs of secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transportation, decomposition and metabolism are the most active at that time. This period is the peak of secondary metabolite accumulation, which proves that the harvesting of Qingqiao from July to August is rational for maximum medicinal benefit.",
