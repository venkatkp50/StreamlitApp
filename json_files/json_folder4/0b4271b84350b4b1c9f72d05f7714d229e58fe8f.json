They also used a freestanding respiratory monitor so as to have a continuous display of patientspecific airflow, VT, airway pressure, and capnography during ventilator sharing. In addition, the indications for this approach were cautiously limited to a 48-hour time span. The authors precluded the use of anesthesia machines for ventilator splitting owing to technical reasons.",

            "text": "The practical limitations of ventilator sharing, however, cannot be overlooked. First, the need for an unoccupied rescue ventilator within each cluster of ventilator-sharing patients, for example, may perhaps defeat the purpose of putting two patients on the same machine. Furthermore, this strategy impedes weaning from mechanical ventilation, a fundamental step to get rid of a ventilator. Ventilator sharing also demands additional patient care, adding even further strain to health systems with already limited resources. And besides the shortage of ventilators, there is also a shortage of personnel with sufficient physiological background and skills to manage severely hypoxemic individuals under mechanical ventilation (6, 7) . The clinical approach itself is daunting. Beitler and his colleagues explained that whenever patients were on ventilator-sharing mode, patient care was assured by the usual clinical team and a consult of either of two intensivists familiar with the system who alternated around the clock. They also pointed out that \"In acute ventilator shortages, after exhausting alternatives, ventilator sharing is a reasonable stopgap..\" What they meant by \"exhausting alternatives\" is somewhat vague. One may wonder if, as a temporizing measure, manually bagging patients-this time with the only innovation being the addition of a positive end-expiratory pressure valve-would also be a reasonable alternative. After all, manually bagging patients by volunteers was successful during the polio epidemics in August 1952 in Copenhagen (8): mortality dropped from near 90% to ,30%. It was a dramatic moment, and its consequences constituted a turning point in the history of medicine (9) . Delivering \"gentle\" and noninjurious ventilation, however, may be more challenging in conditions of acute lung injury than in pure ventilatory failure. An additional strategy might be to have a repository of old ventilators that could be used to provide life-saving treatment in an acute shortage (10) . Appropriate upkeep of these machines is possibly more practical than trying to manufacture new ventilators from scratch in a moment of crisis. One may remember that old pneumatic systems, in spite of their limitations, had much longer half-lives than their more modern \"electronic\" counterparts.",
