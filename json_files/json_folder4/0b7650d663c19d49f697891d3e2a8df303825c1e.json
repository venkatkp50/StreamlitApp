Both councils fulfil the seven core regulatory functions enunciated in the regulatory function framework. 18 These functions are nursing and midwifery legislation; accreditation of preservice education; existing registration system and the use of registration data; licensure process; scope of practice; continuing professional development and professional misconduct and disciplinary powers. [16] [17] [18] [19] Both councils play a critical role in ensuring quality-nursing education through the accreditation of preservice education, the licensure process and the scope of practice regulations, 16 17 which in turn play an important role in providing high-quality care.

In South Africa, the only published study we could find was the 1994 postal survey by Uys to determine the views of key nursing policy actors on the composition, functioning and stakeholder relationships of the SANC, and the apartheid established homeland nursing councils. 32 The study obtained a 42% response rate, and found an overall neutral attitude towards the councils. 32 Respondents reported objections against the process of electing members and of developing regulations, and the people involved in disciplinary hearings. 32 Although useful information was obtained, Uys' study is dated, predating democratic transformation of the SANC.",

In contrast, the heads of NEIs in Ghana scored the N&MC 7.1 and 7.2 for overall functioning and effectiveness, respectively, which are good scores. There are several possible reasons for the differences in the overall mean scores for functioning and effectiveness between SANC and the GN&MC. First, it could reflect the differences in the demographic characteristics of the study participants in the two countries. The South African participants had both more years of work experience and as nurse educators, and therefore had more experience of interacting with the relevant council. In South Africa, there were also more respondents from private NEIs. Second, Likert scales tend to be influenced by culture and/or the differences in geographical settings, 42 43 and hence could explain the different scores obtained for the two nursing regulators. Finally, the different scores might reflect the reality of SANC's functioning and effectiveness, as the regulator has been criticised previously for its dysfunctionality and suboptimal leadership. 14 44 The functional area of policy-making measured eight items that ranged from the existence of a strategic plan to defining nurses' scopes of practice. NEIs in South Africa scored SANC below average for this functional area, and for the majority of items (table 2) . These scores are not surprising as SANC has been criticised for the inertia and delays in the finalisation of nursing education reforms and scopes of practice. 44 45 The N&MC obtained a mean score of 7, which could be due to its reform efforts in the preceding 5 years, including decentralisation to 10 regional offices and digitisation to improve service delivery. 46 47 The heads of NEIs are key stakeholders in ensuring the production of a quality nursing workforce to achieve UHC and meet population health needs. 1 One of the core mandates of N&MC is to update and issue education and practice regulations to ensure the health ",

The study measured the accreditation of NEIs, nursing programmes, clinical training facilities, as well as reaccreditation. These are the core responsibilities of the heads of NEIs that require optimal functioning of the nursing council. The SANC obtained the lowest mean score of 4.10, compared the score of 7.40 of the GN&MC. The finding is not surprising as the SANC is overwhelmed with the phasing out of the legacy qualifications and phasing in of the new qualifications. 45 A 2014 policy analysis study highlighted the slow progress in implementing nursing education reforms, weak governance by the SANC, insufficient commitment and poor planning for implementation. 41 Evidence suggests that the situation remained largely unchanged in 2019. 48 The functional area of examination measured oversight on examination by NEIs, conducting national examinations and monitoring of community or national service for newly trained nurses. SANC obtained an overall score of around 5, while the score for the N&MC was close to 8. The item within the functional area that scored lowest was the monitoring of community service, which is compulsory in South Africa for newly qualified nurses. The differences in the scores for the two councils could be because of the perceptions of insufficient guidance from the SANC on community service for newly qualified professional nurses that was found in a South African province. 49 The N&MC obtained a good score of 8.27 for registration, which could reflect their efforts in using digital technology and creation of regional offices where nurses could register without having to travel to the head office. 46 47 In contrast, the SANC obtained an average score of 5.96. Although SANC has implemented an alternative online registration to augment the onsite services provided, the low score could be due to the reported difficulties of NEIs and nurses with their registration. In addition, the Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa has protested again the SANC's decision to maintain centralised services, and refusal to establish regional offices. 50 Although the N&MC obtained the lowest average score of 6.45 for the functional area of legal and disciplinary action, it was significantly higher than the SANC's average score of 5.52 (p=0.03). These average scores for both regulatory bodies suggest the need for improvements in this functional area. In light of the criticality of the nursing workforce, some scholars have recommended government resource allocation to nursing regulators to enable these institutions to fulfil their responsibilities. 51 52 The mandate of all regulatory bodies is to protect the public against harm. 5 22 An essential aspect of regulation is the availability of the nursing register to the public and employers to verify the qualification and/or competence of nurses. The SANC obtained a significantly higher score (6.44) , compared with the N&MC (4.85) on the availability of the nursing register to the public.",

However, there is need for continuous improvement in all functional areas of these nursing regulators. We could not find studies on similar initiatives as the ARC 5 that provide a forum for nursing regulators to share experiences and learn from each other. For example, the N&MC in Ghana introduced online licensing examination and established regional offices to enhance access and improve efficiency. 50 53 Although a different context, SANC could learn from these experiences of the Ghana N&MC. Furthermore, the WHO Africa regional office or the health desk of the African Union might provide appropriate forums for the sharing of good practices between or among nursing councils. This is important in light of the global goal of UHC, and the criticality of the nursing workforce to achieving this goal. 1 4 CONCLUSION Both the N&MC and SANC are well-established regulators and are vital to ensure that the nursing workforce in each country is able to deliver quality healthcare, thereby contributing to UHC and population health improvements. The findings of this novel comparative study suggest that concerted efforts are needed to improve the functioning and effectiveness of the regulators, especially in South Africa. The six functional areas and 28 items could guide the necessary improvements in regulator Open access functioning and effectiveness, in partnership with relevant stakeholders.",
