Here we report the colorimetric detection of spike (S1) protein of SARS-CoV-2 based on excellent peroxidase-like activity of Au@Pt nanoparticles, with merits of rapidness, easy operation, and high sensitivity. The Au@Pt NPs were fabricated by a facile seed-mediated growth approach, in which spherical Au NPs were premade as seeds, followed by the Pt growth on Au seeds, producing uniform, monodispersed and porous Au@Pt core-shell NPs. The as-obtained Au@Pt NPs showed a remarkable enhancement in the peroxidase-mimic catalysis, which well abided by the typical Michaelis-Menten theory. The enhanced catalysis of Au@Pt NPs was ascribed to the porous nanostructure and formed electron-rich Pt shells, which enabled the catalytic pathway to switch from hydroxyl radical generation to electron transfer process. On a basis of these findings, a colorimetric assay of spike (S1) protein of SARS-CoV-2 was established, with a linear detection range of 10-100 ng mL -1 of protein concentration and a low limit of detection (LOD) of 11 ng mL -1 .",

            "text": "In recent years, the rapid development of nanozymes based on enzyme-like activity of inorganic nanomaterials, especially metallic nanoparticles/nanoclusters containing biocompatible elements (e. g., Au and Pt), has gained considerable attention, owing to potential applications in biomedical fields [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Under mild reaction conditions (e. g., physiological temperature and aqueous phase media), these metallic nanomaterials could catalyze the oxidations of chromogenic enzyme substrates with environmentally benign oxidants including molecular oxygen (O 2 ) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), exhibiting same behavior as oxidases and peroxidases. Besides eco-friendliness of the catalytic system, many of metallic nanozymes demonstrated simplicity of preparation and satisfactory stability, which overcome several intrinsic drawbacks of enzymes [6] , thus attractive for both biochemical industry and laboratory research. For example, via a simple NaBH 4 reduction method, Ahmed et al. obtained the positively-charged cysteamine stabilized Au nanoparticles [7] , which exhibited good peroxidase-like activity in the oxidation of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), yielding typical blue products readily observed by naked eyes. After conjugation of Au nanoparticles (NPs) with influenza virus-specific antibodies, a colorimetric assay was successfully applied to the detection of clinically isolated influenza virus (H3N2), which afforded a LOD of 11.62 plaque forming units (PFU) mL -1 , two orders of magnitude sensitive than conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the commercial kit. Therefore, with advantages of convenience, reliability, and practicality, metallic nanozymes provide a useful platform for colorimetric biosensing.",

For global spread epidemic, the accurate diagnosis with rapidity, simplicity, and low cost, is the primary focus of attention. Several diagnostic methodologies based on plasmonic photothermal effect and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) sensing transduction [13] , reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [14] , electrochemical [15] , graphene-based field-effect transistor (FET) [16] , and immunofluorimetric assay [17] , have been developed. Despite high sensitivity, the first one fails to achieve desired reproducibility in large batches of testing, while others require specific conditions, high testing costs and professional analytical skills, thus unfavorable for point-of-care (POC) test. Intriguingly, Ventura et al. proposed a colorimetric method based on Au NP interaction induced by SARS-CoV-2, which gave rise to the variation of extinction spectrum of corresponding solution in a few minutes, demonstrating potential applications of colorimetric assays in fast and reliable detection of SARS-CoV-2 [18] . To develop a colorimetric assay based on metallic nanozymes for spike (S1) protein of SARS-Cov-2 is anticipated for the POC diagnosis, but less explored to date.",

To access the Au@Pt NPs, the uniform and monodispersed Au NPs as seeds were first prepared, followed by in situ reduction of the Pt 4+ ions on the surface of Au NPs, creating a core-shell nanostructure with porous characteristics. Interestingly, the as-obtained Au@Pt NPs showed remarkably enhanced peroxidase-catalysis. Importantly, the introduction of Pt atoms into Au NPs leaded to a significant change in the enzyme-catalysis pathway, from reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation to fast electron transfer (ET) process. Benefiting from outstanding peroxidase-like activity of Au@Pt NPs, a colorimetric assay for detection of S1 protein of SARS-Cov-2 was then proposed, on a basis of ELISA described as follows (see details in experimental section). Firstly, the as-obtained Au@Pt NPs were functionalized by the antibodies. Afterwards, the capture antibodies were immobilized onto the 96-wells plate, in which the detected antigen was anchored to the specific sites and the bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used to block the remaining unbound sites. Finally, the antibody-functionalized Au@Pt NPs were introduced to attach the antigen, which catalyzed TMB oxidation and realized the detection of the target antigen. The work provides a colorimetric assay based on the metallic nanozyme-catalysis for sensitive detection of S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2. ",

These results indicate TA molecules were partially oxidized by \u2022OH radicals, deriving from self-decomposition of instable H 2 O 2 . However, the FL intensity of the solution at the same wavelength significantly decreased after addition of NPs (red curve, Fig. 6C ). To investigate whether the decrease in FL intensity was related to catalytic decomposition of H 2 O 2 by the Au@Pt 3.15 NPs, the EPR experiments were performed, with CTPO as spin trap for oxygen. As shown in Fig. S6A , compared to the control experiment, the super hyperfine structure in the EPR spectra became weak in the presence of 0.5 mM of Au@Pt 3.15 NPs, which further became smooth when the concentration of Au@Pt 3.15 NPs was increased to 5 mM, indicating production of more O 2 gas. Thus, the At the same time, the possible ET process was investigated by oxidation of reduced cytochrome C (red-CytC), an active electron acceptor bears characteristic absorption peaks at 520 and 550 nm [33] . After co-incubation of red-CytC and NPs, these peaks disappeared while a new peak appeared at 530 nm assigned to the oxidized CytC (Fig.   6D ), indicating electron transfer from the substrate to the catalyst. Meanwhile, the electronic structure of the Au@Pt 3.15 NPs was studied by XPS. Compared to the Au 4f 7/2 core level BE (84.3 eV) in the Au NPs (Fig. S8) , the Au@Pt 3.15 NPs exhibited a positive Au 4f 7/2 core level BE shift (0.4 eV), suggesting the electronic structure of Au atoms was modified by Pt atoms. The increase of BE in the Au@Pt 3.15 NPs indicates that electrons transferred from Au atoms to Pt atoms, leading to formation of electron-deficient Au cores but electron-rich Pt shells, and thus favorable for adsorption and activation of TMB molecules. The Au cores provided electrons for the Pt atoms on the shells, which brought a substantial change in the catalytic pathway of the Au NPs, that is, from intrinsic ROS generation to fast ET, ultimately facilitating catalysis of the Au@Pt 3.15 NPs.",

As listed in Table S3 , present ELISA kit gave a LOD with a value of 11 ng mL -1 , lower than the HRP conjugated one (19 ng mL -1 ), HRP conjugated monoclonal antibodies (37 ng mL -1 for F26G18 or 19 ng mL -1 for F157) [34] , and other methods such as electrochemical (14 ng mL -1 ) [35] . Therefore, present assay showed high sensitivity. The selectivity of our method was further examined. From Fig. 8 , the solution containing S1 protein presented the largest absorbance, showing a brown color easily observed by naked eyes. However, in the control experiments involving other proteins (e. g., nuclear protein, glucose oxidase, collagen, BSA, \u03b1-amylase, and lysozyme), none of them gave significant absorbance, with light yellow color of solutions. Thus, the established assay demonstrated good selectivity towards S1 protein. ",

Meanwhile, direct evidence of \u2022OH generation by the Au@Pt 3.15 NPs was not obtained by EPR, in which no signal was observed (Fig. S6B).

In the presence of Au NPs, there was a slight decrease in the absorbance of solution of Rh B (Fig. S7A), while an increase in the fluorescence intensity of solution at 440 nm was observed for TA oxidation (Fig. S7B). The results indicate partial oxidation of Rh B and TA molecules, as a result of generation of \u2022OH radicals by the Au NPs. The observation was also proved by EPR, in which the Au NPs gave a four-line signal with a 1:2:2:1 peak-to-peak intensity pattern (Fig. S6B), characteristic of adduct of \u2022OH and DMPO [1], suggesting capability of generating \u2022OH radicals by the Au NPs. Thus, different from the Au@Pt 3.15 NPs, the Au NPs followed a pathway of ROS generation during catalysis. Additionally, considering the dissolved O 2 in buffer, other possible ROS like 1 O 2 and O 2 \u2022\u2212 radicals were also studied by EPR. However, neither of them was identified for both Au and Au@Pt NPs, since no obvious change of EPR signal compared with those of control experiments (Figs. S6C and 6D).
