We included all patients (aged \u226518 years) admitted to participating ICUs with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection before April 28, 2020. Patients who were moribund or had life-support measures withdrawn within 24 h of ICU admission, prisoners, patients with pre-existing mental illness, neurodegenerative disorders, congenital or acquired brain damage, hepatic coma, drug overdose, suicide attempt, or those who were blind or deaf were excluded. We collected de-identified data from electronic health records on patient demographics, delirium and coma assessments, and management strategies for a 21-day period. Additional data on ventilator support, ICU length of stay, and vital status was collected for a 28-day period. The primary outcome was to determine the prevalence of delirium and coma and to investigate any associated risk factors associated with development of delirium the next day. We also investigated predictors of number of days alive without delirium or coma. These outcomes were investigated using multivariable regression.",

The median age of patients was 64 years (IQR 54 to 71) with a median Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II of 40\u00b70 (30\u00b70 to 53\u00b70). 1397 (66\u00b79%) of 2088 patients were invasively mechanically ventilated on the day of ICU admission and 1827 (87\u00b75%) were invasively mechanical ventilated at some point during hospitalisation. Infusion with sedatives while on mechanical ventilation was common: 1337 (64\u00b70%) of 2088 patients were given benzodiazepines for a median of 7\u00b70 days (4\u00b70 to 12\u00b70) and 1481 (70\u00b79%) were given propofol for a median of 7\u00b70 days (4\u00b70 to 11\u00b70). Median Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale score while on invasive mechanical ventilation was -4 (-5 to -3). 1704 (81\u00b76%) of 2088 patients were comatose for a median of 10\u00b70 days (6\u00b70 to 15\u00b70) and 1147 (54\u00b79%) were delirious for a median of 3\u00b70 days (2\u00b70 to 6\u00b70). Mechanical ventilation, use of restraints, and benzodiazepine, opioid, and vasopressor infusions, and antipsychotics were each associated with a higher risk of delirium the next day (all p\u22640\u00b704), whereas family visitation (in person or virtual) was associated with a lower risk of delirium (p<0\u00b70001). During the 21-day study period, patients were alive without delirium or coma for a median of 5\u00b70 days (0\u00b70 to 14\u00b70). At baseline, older age, higher SAPS II scores, male sex, smoking or alcohol abuse, use of vasopressors on day 1, and invasive mechanical ventilation on day 1 were independently associated with fewer days alive and free of delirium and coma (all p<0\u00b701). 601 (28\u00b78%) of 2088 patients died within 28 days of admission, with most of those deaths occurring in the ICU.",

Since the pandemic began, it is estimated that around 1\u00b75 million patients have been admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide, of whom, 750 000 patients have required mechanical ventilation for viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 3, 4 COVID-19 has been shown to cause acute organ dysfunction; however, brain dysfunction has not been systematically studied in large representative populations of ICU patients. [5] [6] [7] Coma and delirium are serious manifestations of acute brain dysfunction, which often accompany systemic critical illness, and delirium has been associated with poor outcomes in critically ill patients without COVID-19, including mortality, cognitive dysfunction, and subse quent dementia in survivors. 8 Previously, delirium has been reported to affect up to 70% of patients who require mechanical ventilation, 9 but a 2018 multicentre study that adhered to guidelinerecommended practices 10 reported delirium prevalence rates of less than 50%. 11 Data from smaller cohorts of mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 have suggested that these practice guidelines are not being adhered to, and patients are often prescribed higher doses of sedatives and analgesics than patients without COVID-19. 12, 13 This approach might be secondary to concerns that the acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19 is markedly different from acute respiratory failure due to bacterial pneumonia or other causes of sepsis, 14 reports of propofol shortages, the use of non-ICU trained staff to treat patients during surges in patient numbers, prolonged use of neuromuscular blockade, and concerns regarding propofol infusion syndrome, selfextubation, and proning. [15] [16] [17] Although most previous studies of neurological manifestations of COVID-19 7 did not systematically evaluate patients for delirium despite the availability of validated monitoring tools, one small ICU study reported a delirium prevalence of 84%, 12 whereas a delirium prevalence of 11-12% has been reported among the general population of hospitalised patients with COVID-19. 18, 19 Although the true prevalence of delirium in critically ill patients with COVID-19 is unknown, patients with COVID-19 are at high risk of delirium due to systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation, other organ system failures, increased risk of thrombosis, and the effects of deep sedative strategies, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and social isolation from families. 12, 20, 21 We aimed to elucidate sedation practices, ICU resource constraints, the prevalence of coma, and the prevalence",

Delirium has also been shown to be a significant predictor of acquired dementia after critical illness. This study of a large, representative sample of critically ill patients shows that clinicians have reverted to outdated and potentially harmful treatment strategies of deep sedation with widespread use of benzodiazepine infusions, immobilisation, and isolation from families because of the COVID-19 pandemic; these changes in clinical practice are associated with significantly higher prevalence and duration of delirium and coma, portending a major risk for ICU-related dementia and survivorship. Since no pharmaceutical therapies are available for the treatment of COVID-19 at present, this study provides evidence that clinicians should aim to use supportive and proven therapies that avoid deep sedation with benzodiazepine infusions, and facilitate safe in-person or virtual visitation for patients with COVID- 19. of, and risk factors for delirium in the ongoing pandemic to guide clinicians and mitigate delirium and associated long-term cognitive consequences for patients with COVID-19 in the future.",

Ventilatorfree days indicates the number of days the patient was alive and free of the mechanical ventilation (invasive or non-invasive) in a 28-day period.

Some percentages do not sum to 100 because of rounding. Summary statistics were reported for non-missing values. PaO 2 =partial pressure arterial oxygen. FiO 2 =fraction of inspired oxygen. *Six patients were aged >90 years and thus their ages were rounded down to 90 years when entered into the database to maintain regulatory rules for de-identified data; in accordance with country regulatory rules, for 44 patients included at two participating sites, age values were rounded to the nearest ten. \u2020Race was recorded as entered into the electronic health record; 56 (2\u00b77%) of 2088 patients had no race reported in the medical record or the participating site could not report their race due to regulatory limitations, thus these patients were included in the other category. \u2021Scores range from 0 to 33, with higher scores indicating a higher burden of coexisting illness. \u00a7Scores range from 0 to 163 with higher scores indicating greater severity of illness; a median score of 40 represents a patient population with moderate severity of critical illness. \u00b6Defined as a PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio of 200-300. ||Defined as a PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio of 100-199. **Defined as a PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio of <100. \u2020 \u2020Other diagnosis represents patients who were admitted to the hospital and required treatment in the intensive care unit for a reason other than COVID-19, who then tested positive; such diagnoses included diabetic ketoacidosis, acute myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, post-operative surgery surveillance, acute kidney failure, and acute gastrointestinal bleeding. \u2021 \u2021Infusions included remifentanil, sufentanil, fentanyl, morphine, and hydromorphone. To evaluate risk factors for delirium and coma-free days (calculated as the number of days alive without delirium or coma during the 21 days after ICU admission), we used a proportional odds logistic regression model. Since delirium and coma-free days is a continuous, ordinal outcome that is non-normally distributed, a proportional odds logistic regression model for ordinal dependent variables was considered the best choice, as prespecified in the statistical analysis plan. Proportional odds assumptions were evaluated using graphical methods and were met satisfactorily. Covariates for this model were chosen a priori and included baseline variables including age, sex, SAPS II score, baseline vision or hearing impairment, smoking and alcohol abuse, and ICU day 1 data for respiratory support type, vasopressors, position (prone vs supine), restraint use, deepest sedation level (in RASS equivalents), and exposure to sedatives, opioids, antipsychotics, and oral anxiolytics or hypnotics.",

We found that more than 80% of patients had coma and more than 50% developed delirium. These results build on the initial retrospective reports from Wuhan, China, which reported that 40 (45%) of 88 patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19 had nervous system symptoms, with 13 (15%) having impaired consciousness. 7 Similarly, in a small cohort, Helms et al 12 reported that 118 (84%) of 140 patients had delirium or abnormal neurological examination that highly correlated with time on ventilation. More recent cohorts of critically ill patients have reported combined durations of coma and delirium of less than a week, however, in this large COVID-19 cohort study, we found that patients had combined acute brain dysfunction for almost 2 weeks. In the MIND-USA study, 11 the median duration of coma was was 1 day and that of delirium was 4 days, for a total of 5 days. In contrast, in our cohort, the median duration of coma was 10 days, and 3 days for delirium. We also found that more than 50% of patients had a median of 2 days of hyperactive delirium (IQR 1\u00b70-4\u00b70), which is higher than that reported previously. 35 Such prolonged periods of acute brain dysfunction have negative implications for impaired survivorship of patients with COVID-19. Patients with acute brain dysfunction are at high risk of developing ICU-associated dementia and associated post-intensive care syndrome, which affects quality of life 8,36,37 and should be avoided by using lighter targeted sedation if possible. All patients who had at least 90% delirium or coma assessments during their index ICU stay and 2 days of ICU stay were included in this analysis (n=2049). Other states, such as comatose, awake without delirium, deceased, and discharged (from index ICU) were considered as competing risks for this multinomial regression analysis. Risk factors with scores greater than 1 (and not crossing 1) were associated with a statistically higher risk of delirium the following day. ICU=intensive care unit. OR=odds ratio.

            "text": "Although SARS-CoV-2 infection was initially hypothesised to contribute directly to neurological symptoms, it seems more likely that neurological effects are caused indirectly by factors such as low blood-oxygen levels, coagu lopathy, exposure to sedative and analgesic drugs, isolation, and immobility. 12, 38, 39 Heavy sedation, especially with benzo diazepines, 10, 40 is generally considered to increase risk of delirium and coma during acute illness, and often protocol-driven efforts to minimise sedation when managing acute respiratory failure have led to reductions in acute brain dysfunction. 29, 41, 42 Early reports during the pandemic advocated neuromuscular blockade and deep sedation to treat patients with COVID-19 who have ARDS. Our data reflect this management strategy with a high proportion of patients given benzodiazepines (64%) and propofol (71%), both for a median of 7 days. Patient factors, such as increased ventilator-patient dyssynchrony, need for higher positive end expiratory pressures, agitation, and the decision to prone patients, might have also contributed to deeper sedation. The prolonged use of deep sedation could also be secondary to the increased number of ICU patients observed at our sites, the need to utilise non-ICU-trained staff, and inadequate resources with regards to providers, equipment, and sedatives. Our results indicate that regardless of the indication, prolonged sedation is not without consequences, and such findings provide an opportunity to improve care for future patients.",

            "text": "Our results support avoidance of benzodiazepine sedative infusions, which were associated with a 59% higher risk of developing delirium. When possible, health-care providers should adhere to current sedation guidelines for mechanically ventilated patients, even those with COVID-19, which recommend limiting neuromuscular blockade, avoidance of continuous infusions of benzodiazepines, light levels of sedation, frequent awakening and breathing trials, and mobilisation; these practices improve short-term outcomes and might also reduce the risk of post-intensive care syndrome, which affects a high proportion of acute respiratory failure survivors. [43] [44] [45] This is in line with earlier recommendations from Fan and colleagues, 16 who recommended that clinicians should adhere to evidence-based practices and manage the mechanical ventilation needs and associated needs of patients with COVID-19 in a similar manner to those without the disease. As our ability to care for patients with COVID-19 improve, with better strategies to combat the virus itself and associated sequelae, and health-care systems prepare for subsequent waves of infection, it is crucial for ICU practitioners to move away from deep sedation towards the use of lighter sedation when patient-related factors and logistical issues permit its safe use, for optimum patient recovery.",

            "text": "Our study had several limitations that warrant consideration. Because all data were collected during a short time period in May, 2020, changes in the routine care of patients with severe COVID-19 might have All patients who had at least 90% delirium or coma assessments during their index intensive care unit stay were included in this analysis (n=2062). Risk factors with an OR of less than 1 indicate a negative patient outcome (fewer days alive and free of brain dysfunction coma or delirium). OR=odds ratio.

However, since only a few months have passed since the study was completed, the results are likely to remain highly relevant. The retrospective study design meant that clinical assessments, which might be less sensitive than prospective research assessments, were used to detect delirium and coma. Medical teams did these assessments prospectively as part of routine care using validated instruments, and the inclusion of ICUs at 69 sites across 14 countries greatly enhanced the generalisability of study findings. Furthermore, we did not collect any neuroimaging data to further substantiate our findings. We also did not collect data on acute kidney injury, and therefore were unable to evaluate the associations of acute kidney injury and delirium in this population. Additionally, we did not collect data on sedative doses, sedation goals, or the rationale for sedation choices, but can speculate on the basis of reports 13 that suggested use of deep sedation and neuromuscular blockade, compounded with resource constraints, led to some of the choices made. The timing of delirium assessments and daily sedation cessation were also not tracked. Although it is possible that we might have over estimated delirium prevalence slightly if done while patients were on sedative medications, 47 rapidly resolving sedativeinduced delirium is rare (approximately 10%) 48 and most cases of delirium persist even with daily awakening trials. Additionally, we did not include patients with known history of brain conditions and doing so might have resulted in an underestimation of delirium prevalence. Patients were not screened for coma or delirium after discharge from the ICU and thus during the days after index ICU discharge until the day of death or the end of 21 days (whichever occurred first) patients were considered to be awake without delirium; as a result, we might have under-reported the duration of delirium. We chose a 2-week period for data collection to allow sites to enrol all patients with COVID-19 who met study eligibility criteria and to ensure that up to 28 days of data would be available by database closure date. Although we enrolled more than 2000 patients, data collection was not possible for 1036 additionally eligible patients. Exclusion of these patients could have led to some bias in our results, although the variability in enrolling patients between study countries did not vary greatly. As in any observational study, we cannot determine causality when examining factors associated with delirium and coma in patients with COVID-19. We did not record whether coma was intentionally drug induced or secondary to a patient's disease process. However, our results are consistent with the findings of numerous previous studies of delirium and coma in acute respiratory patients without COVID-19, and are key for health-care teams to formulate quality improvement decisions for COVID-19 moving forward, using evidence collected before the current pandemic 16 and large multinational studies, such as ours, to identify potential modifiable risk factors.",
