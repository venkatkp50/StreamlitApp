The exposure to backlit screens before falling asleep leads to negative consequences on sleep health through its influence on the circadian system. We investigated the relationship between the changes in evening screen exposure and the time course of sleep disturbances during the home confinement period due to COVID-19. Methods: 2123 Italians were longitudinally tested during the third and the seventh week of lockdown. The web-based survey evaluated sleep quality and insomnia symptoms through the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Insomnia Severity Index. During the second assessment, respondents reported the changes in the backlit screen exposure in the two hours before falling asleep. Results: Participants who increased electronic device usage showed decreased sleep quality, exacerbated insomnia symptoms, reduced sleep duration, higher sleep onset latency, and delayed bedtime and rising time. In this subgroup, the prevalence of poor sleepers and clinical insomniacs increased. Conversely, respondents reporting decreased screen exposure exhibited improved sleep quality and insomnia symptoms. In this subgroup, the prevalence of poor sleepers and clinical insomniacs decreased. Respondents preserving their screen time habits did not show any change in the sleep parameters. Conclusions: Our investigation demonstrated a strong relationship between the modifications of the evening electronic device usage and the time course of sleep disturbances during the lockdown period. Interventions to raise public awareness about the risks of excessive exposure to backlit screens are necessary to prevent sleep disturbances and foster well-being during the home confinement due to COVID-19.",

            "text": "During this unprecedented situation, governments across the globe implemented extraordinary measures to reduce the spread of the contagion and the pressure on the healthcare systems. From 9 March to 4 May 2020 a total lockdown was imposed in Italy, involving a large-scale closure of most work activities, social distancing, and a home-based quarantine imposition to the general population. The home confinement measures had a substantial negative impact on global mental health and psychological well-being. 1, 2 The considerable impairment of the daily routine had consistent repercussions on sleep health and circadian rhythms, as documented by several studies. [3] [4] [5] [6] However, evidence on the time course of sleep disturbances during the extended period of restraining measures is scarce. 7 The forced social isolation and the limitations of the outdoor activities led to a worldwide increase in web-based social communication. [8] [9] [10] Electronic devices daily usage increased [11] [12] [13] to compensate for the limited social interactions, fill free time, and ward off boredom. The implementation of these habits may have helped to cope with the challenging and stressful isolation period. Nevertheless, the increase of screen exposure in the hours before bedtime could have determined adverse consequences on sleep health. The sleep rhythms are intimately linked with the ambient light, which represents a crucial regulator of the biological clock. Human eyes comprise non-visual photoreceptors that are primarily responsive to ~450-480 nm light within the blue portion of the spectrum. 14, 15 The activation of this system leads to a suppression of the melatonin release, which is a key sleep-related pineal gland hormone. 16 The evening exposure to short-wavelength-enriched light has alerting effects and detrimental consequences on sleep. 17, 18 Nowadays, most screens of modern electronic devices (computer, smartphone, tablet, television) are equipped with light-emitting diodes (LEDs) having a peak wavelength in the blue range of ~460 nm. 19 .

[20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] The impact of screen exposure before falling asleep on the melatonin secretion was confirmed by several studies that experimentally manipulated the evening exposure to tablet, 28 eReader, 29 and computer screens. 19, 30 These investigations also reported decreased objective and self-reported sleepiness, higher sleep onset latency, and altered sleep architecture. Conversely, other studies showed protective effects of blocking blue light emissions on melatonin regulation 31 and sleep quality, both in healthy 32 and clinical insomniac subjects. 33, 34 Based on this evidence, the present study aimed to shed light on the relationship between the longitudinal changes of sleep disturbances between the third and the seventh week of home confinement in Italy and the retrospectively reported modifications of the exposure to electronic devices before falling asleep during the same lockdown period. We hypothesized that the changes in electronic device usage could be a crucial mediator of the lockdownrelated sleep alterations over time. We expected that individuals that increased their screen exposure should have shown the largest sleep impairments and the most marked alterations of the sleep/wake schedule. On the other hand, subjects that reduced screen time should have exhibited a positive time course of sleep disturbances.",

Nevertheless, the two interpretations are not mutually exclusive, and a bidirectional model of causation has been suggested. 58 We propose that a vicious circle during the confinement period was established, in which the increased screen exposure before falling asleep negatively impacted the sleep parameters, which in turn supported the overuse of electronic devices after the sunset.",

To date, the feared risk of a second wave of contagion is increasingly becoming a concrete reality, and hundreds of thousands of people are subjected to home confinement measures worldwide. In light of our results, the above-mentioned interventions focused on sleep hygiene are fundamental to counteract the occurrence and exacerbation of sleep disturbances and foster the general well-being during the home confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint",

The ISI is a validated instrument used to assess the severity of insomnia symptoms.
