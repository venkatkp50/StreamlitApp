Production of final drug substance is a challenge and can take up to one year as a result of scarce, long lead-time raw materials and several low yielding steps. 3 Due to issues of pricing and licensing, countries are left questioning who will or will not have access to the drug. 2c A more robust supply chain can be developed by inventing from inherently available building blocks (commodities) and increasing the route's yields and throughput. We call this \"Supply Centered Synthesis\" (SCS). 4 The topic of supply chain security was examined within the construct of remdesivir's pyrrolotriazine synthesis (Figure 1 ). The triazine passes through several low yielding steps, and as an early raw material, large quantities are required. Possibly a preferred route could help overcome recent challenges related to supply and price. The only full route to the base triazine 1 was published by Bayer Healthcare 5,6 despite the biological importance of the pyrrolo[2,1-f ][1,2,4]triazine framework. 7 The sequence above nicely supplied preparative quantities of triazine (50 g scale); however, some aspects of the route warrant improvement.",

Hydrazine is protected as a carbazate, and then carbamate 2 must be deprotected to reveal amine 3. This creates mass inefficiency, adds to the step-count, and decreases overall yield. 3. 2,5-Dimethoxytetrahydrofuran and tert-butyl carbazate are not commodity materials. 2,5-Dimethoxytetrahydrofuran is made in two steps from furan. 8 tert-Butyl carbazate is made in four chemical steps from tertbutanol and ammonia. 9 Derivatizing commodities requires additional chemical processing and creates waste. The ideal synthesis would increase overall yield, proceed from commodity materials, and reduce step count, thus strengthening the remdesivir supply chain. This work describes investigation of the bond-forming steps to do so from pyrrole which is abundant and made commercially in one step from furan. 11 Formyl groups are easily installed in the 2-position of pyrroles, 12 and aldehydes can be oxidized to nitriles via aldoxime intermediates. 13 Moreover N-amination of pyrroles and indoles, though challenging, are known. 14 The hypothetical synthesis would intercept the penultimate intermediate 3 at this point, and the demonstrated literature condensation with formamidine acetate would render triazine 1. One could foresee how these transformations could be executed with reagents having high atom economy and market availability. 15 Perhaps efficiency could be further increased by reducing the step count and thus eliminating associated workups.",

            "text": "Results and Discussion. I. A One-Pot Oxidative Vilsmeier Cascade. This effort began with functionalization of pyrrole ( Figure 2 ). Perhaps isolation of the aldehyde or aldoxime intermediates is unnecessary. 2-Formyl pyrrole is a low melting solid not easily distilled or recrystallized in good yield. Moreover, waste will be generated in the process of purifying the aldehyde, aldoxime, or other intermediates. The iminium chloride salt could possibly be used to form nitrile 4 directly in a one-pot process. Residual POCl 3 and related species would need to be quenched due to chemical incompatibility with hydroxylamine; however, the HCl generated in the course of the quench could be used as a catalyst for the dehydration of aldoxime. 16 The POCl 3 quench should be monitored to ensure completion. 17 This concept was validated experimentally with surprising simplicity by adding water or ethanol prior to adding the hydroxylamine salt to give the product in >80% assay yield (AY) (entries 1\u22122). A recent paper nicely demonstrated use of DMPU\u00b7HCl as a key additive, but in our case, DMF as solvent worked sufficiently well. 16c The yield was further improved to >90% AY by activating the oxime formed in situ with acetic anhydride and base (entries 3\u22126). Distillation provided pure material for downstream investigations (entries 8\u22129). There are very few examples of one-pot nitrile formation via strategies that make use of an oxidative Vilsmeier cascade, and this avoids the use of costly and high molecular weight iodine. 18 II. Assessing Amination Feasibility. The conditions of Hynes Jr. were used as a starting point to explore the critical amination ( Figure 3 ). Chloramine was made from bleach and ammonia and then extracted into MTBE. Pyrrole 4 converted cleanly to the N-amino product (95% AY) resolving the discrepancy between moderate isolated yield and high conversion. 14b,19 This serves as a drop-in replacement for 3 and improves yield to 88% as compared to 41% by the literature route. Unfortunately the reaction conditions are highly dilute (1 wt %) as a function of extracting monochloramine from water into MTBE, thus limiting overall throughput and jeopardizing supply. For this reason, strategies which would increase throughput of N-amino-2-cyanopyrrole were needed. This was also the likely conclusion of Bristol Myers Squibb, whose subsequent disclosures focused on improved efficiencies via in situ chloramine production in a biphasic mixture 20 and production of gaseous chloramine to negate the need for dilute organic solution. 21 Amination attempts with the biphasic conditions were unsuccessful, and we did not have access to the degree of engineering required for gaseous chloramine generation; however use of solid aminating reagents such as O-(4-Nitrobenzoyl)hydroxylamine provided a means to run reactions at 15\u221220 volumes, thus greatly increasing product throughput. 22 This reagent has been used at scale; 14d however, neither aminating reagent is available at commodity levels, they are not atom economic, and there are safety concerns with use of these reagents at increasing temperatures and concentrations. 23 Complements to these existing strategies were thus the focal point of remaining efforts.",

It is desirable to keep the pH above 8, use NH 4 Cl in place of NH 4 SO 4 , and cool the reaction during synthesis. Here, the pH is kept \u226512 at all stages of reaction. Facilities should carefully assess production prior to scaling. III. Increasing Amination Space\u2212Time Yield. The remainder of the investigation centered on use of monochloramine. It is an optimal reagent to install the nitrogen atom because atom economy is high, and it is made from simple ingredients which can be accessed anywhere in the world, bleach and ammonia. To render monochloramine accessible, the volumes of extraction solvent (MTBE) must be mitigated. 0.5\u22120.9 M NH 2 Cl/MTBE solutions were produced which were five to ten times stronger than the reported value.

            "text": "Effective cycle time for this operation can be achieved because MTBE is easily removed from reaction solution due to its low boiling point (55\u00b0C), and because the amination of pyrrole is very rapid, occurring in less than 5 min. This presents a reasonable path toward manufacturing, and 90% of solvent was recycled. Aminated pyrrole was made in 90% assay yield, and this result was scaled 100\u00d7 to 10 g without change in performance. The amination investigation was concluded with preliminary exploration of strategies which might address the hazards of NaH and DMF mixtures. 22, 26 Preliminary calorimetric data to be released in a follow-up publication indicated low thermal risk; however, the hazard can be eliminated by replacing DMF with diglyme (97% AY).",

Further, the concept of on-demand chloramine fits perfectly within a scheme designed to capture and recycle solvent, thus limiting waste and improving throughput. High concentration aqueous chlora mine solutions have been produced for on-site water treatment and manufacturing via a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) at concentrations up to 2 M. 28 The conditions of Hynes were modified for continuous synthesis and separation to demonstrate proof of concept. Chloramine was simultaneously made and extracted into MTBE in a CSTR with a 10 min residence time. This biphasic mixture flowed into a gravity separator. Steady state was reached within 30 min, and titration of the MTBE layer showed that \u223c0.45 M chloramine was produced as compared to a 0.52 M solution made in batch.",

For efficiency's sake the synthesis was telescoped through to the triazine rather than isolate at this stage ( Figure 6 ). Prior experience with hydroxypropyl adenine (HPA) suggested that DMF might be a good solvent for the condensation reaction of the aminonitrile with formamidinium acetate. 29 Formamidine acetate was added to the amination reaction mixture and heated to form the triazine. This provided 1 in 75% AY over two steps. A quick solubility study suggested that water or MTBE would be appropriate antisolvents. In situ concentration of reaction mixture followed by addition of water afforded the desired triazine in >60% IY over two steps.",
