            "text": "Mzuzu is one of the four cities in Malawi, with a population of 221,272 (National Statistics Office, 2018). Mzuzu health centre also known as Mapale or Mzimba North Health centre is stituated at the City centre of Mzuzu city while Mzuzu Central Hospital is situated at around 4 km Northwards of the city. The health centre currently serves almost the whole city as a primary health care point while the central hospital is regional referral tertiary hospital serving six districts in the northern region, over hundred health centres and serving a population of over 1.9 million people. It also serves as a secondary healthcare facility for the local (Mzuzu city) population. The majority (98.0%) of our participants were from Mapale health centre. The Central hospital initially served as a primary healthcare facility also but prior to commencement of the study the local health authority decided to maintain it as a secondary care facility only. Therefore it introduced a \"bypass fee\" where patients who attended the hospital clinics without being referred from a health centre/district hospital were charged MK 1,500 (approxmately 2 Euros). This led to Mapale becoming the main site of recruitment due to the focus on recruiting patients from primary care and before they had 8.5% (6.6-10.7%). Survey data indicates 64.8% of HIV-infected mothers and 46.9% of HIVexposed infants received some form of antiretroviral prophylaxis 2 .",
