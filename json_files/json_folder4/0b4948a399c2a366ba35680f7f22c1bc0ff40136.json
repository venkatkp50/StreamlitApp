            "text": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for two highly effective Sars-CoV-2 (COVID-19) vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. More recently, EUA was granted for the Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccine which uses traditional virus-based technology. In this vaccine, researchers added the gene for the coronavirus spike protein to modified Adenovirus 26 and named it Ad26.COV2-S. Nearly 7 million doses of the Ad26.COV2-S have been administered as of mid-April 2021. Recently the Federal Drug Administration and Center for Disease Control and Prevention reviewed data involving six reported cases in the United States of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia in people who received the vaccination. All cases were in women between 18 and 48, with symptoms developing six to 13 days after vaccination. A recent study in the United Kingdom reported similar events in 23 patients age 21 to 77, 61% of which were female, with cases of presumed vaccine induced thrombosis and thrombocytopenia occurring six to 24 days after vaccination. We report a 62-year-old female who presented to the emergency department (ED) with acute onset of altered mental status. She had received the Ad26.COV2-S vaccine 37 days prior to ED presentation. She developed thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and no other cause was found. To our knowledge this is the first case in the United States of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura after receiving the Ad26.COV2-S COVID-19 vaccine.",

On hospital day #2 platelets were 11,000 k/\u03bcL, BUN 66 mg/dL and creatinine 6.00 mg/dL. Her liver function tests were abnormal with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 982 U/L and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 231 U/L. Her fibrinogen increased to 619 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase was >2500 U/L, and her high-sensitivity troponin was found to be 2408 ng/L. Hemoglobin dropped from 14 g/dL on admission to 8.2 g/dL on American Journal of Emergency Medicine xxx (xxxx) xxx hospital day #2. Her anti-platelet factor 4 test, double stranded DNA antibody test, and compliment component 3 were normal. Direct coombs was negative. Compliment component 4 was slightly low at 12 mg/dL and ADAMTS13 activity was <12%. Leading diagnostic considerations included thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), hemolytic uremic syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation of uncertain etiology, and vaccine induced prothrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) which has been described related to the BioNTech ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine [1] . Once in the medical ICU plasma exchange and high dose steroids were initiated due to worsening platelets. When her haptoglobin and ADAMTS 13 results were abnormal, the diagnosis of TTP was confirmed. While hospitalized the patient required hemodialysis, packed red blood cells for anemia, plasma exchange, and 10,000 mg of methylprednisolone daily.",

In almost every patient, high levels of antibodies to platelet factor 4 (PF4)-polyanion complexes were identified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), as well by assays based on platelet activation, which, when tested, was enhanced by addition of PF4. In contrast to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, binding of antibody to PF4 occurred in the absence of heparin. This serologic pattern mirrors findings in patients with \"atypical\" or \"autoimmune\" heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, in whom thrombi develop in the absence of known previous exposure to heparin, but the distribution of thrombi in patients with that condition clearly differs from that in patients with VITT. In VITT, the majority of cases of thrombosis are in the cerebral veins [2] . On the basis of these reports, the diagnosis of VITT should be confirmed with an approved P4 ELISA. Our patient was PF4 negative.",
