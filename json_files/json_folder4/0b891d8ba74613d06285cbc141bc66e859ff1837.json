Yuen et al. 1 propose implementation of virtual surgical training using Web-based and electronic technology in an attempt to address the current training gaps caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic. While we agree with the authors' suggestions of online patient conferences, virtual sit-down didactics, utilizing smart devices for rounds, telemedicine-assisted clinical visit appointments, and live-streaming surgeries via headlights, 1 we believe there are further suggestions and factors to be taken into consideration to enhance remote surgical training.",

In their study, by sending texts to medical students and general surgery residents about observed cases or patients from rounds, they instigated \"academic epinephrine\" as an educational stimulus induced at an unexpected time. 2 This method of teaching was effective, and the authors received positive feedback from trainees. Other examples include utilizing smart device questions [through Poll Everywhere (San Francisco, Calif.) or Kahoot! (Oslo, Norway)] during educational hours and didactic meetings to assure trainee participation. Lastly, surgical videos, webinars, and surgical and anatomical application software (such as Touch Surgery; Touch Surgery Labs, London, United Kingdom) can be utilized to maintain trainee surgical skills.",

In a study focusing on telemedicine in cleft palate care and cost analysis, for patients living in the United States, 239 miles per visit were saved by patients using telehealth; the costs of travel, lodging, and lost wages due to missing work for appointments should also be conserved. 4 Thus, telemedicine not only enhances surgical training but also benefits patients. Such benefits would be enhanced in indigent communities and for underserved populations (e.g., transgender patients). It can improve accessibility of care and medical services for the populations in need.",

By offering preoperative and postoperative telehealth services, patients are required to travel only for the procedure, while receiving the rest of their care through this medium. This would address the health disparities some patients may experience due to geographical barriers. In addition, by being allowed to participate in these telehealth appointments for gender affirmation surgery, trainees will gain experience in this important field of plastic surgery.",

Although nothing can replace intraoperative observation of and assistance with cases by trainees, especially with the recent bans on elective surgery being lifted, video conferencing for students and residents in training is an invaluable addition to patient care.",
