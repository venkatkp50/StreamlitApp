            "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the global pandemic of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) on 11 March 2020 [1] . The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an unusual life, symbolized by the isolation and confinement of wearing a mask and social distancing [2] . To respond to the severity of COVID-19, the Korean government has raised the infectious disease crisis level to \"severe\". It has strengthened the early detection of infected patients, screening clinics, and quarantine regulations to block inflow and spread [3] . The government has established and implemented a policy to curb the spread of COVID-19 by applying intensive social distancing rules in religious facilities, PC rooms, and indoor sports facilities to prevent group infection [3] . The Korean Ministry of Education is currently delaying the opening of all kindergarten, elementary, middle, and high schools as well as universities across the country to protect students from COVID-19 [4] . These lockdowns are affecting people's work, education, travel, and leisure, thus including their level of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) [5] . Reduced the body composition, muscular strength, and balance ability of adolescents [6] , increased the obesity rate [7] , and affected mental health [8] was reported severe concerns during non-face-to-face classes due to Lifestyle behaviors, such as PA and SB among adolescents, may be affected by school closures and long-term confinement at home during the COVID-19 pandemic [9] . Likewise, in Korea, isolation from the family for a long time and the delay in normal school life pose a great threat to the physical and mental health and daily life of middle-school adolescents [10] . In general, schools are well equipped to promote health-related physical fitness and PA among adolescents, as they spend 6-7 h a day at school for 40 weeks of the year; there are facilities, equipment, curricula, and physical education (PE) experts who can intervene in health promotion [11] . Furthermore, these environments can help adolescents meet the recommended daily 60 min of moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and develop the knowledge, skills, and confidence to continue PA in the future [12] . MVPA is important for maintaining and improving health-related fitness (i.e., body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength, endurance, and flexibility) [13] . Therefore, the change in PE class methods, i.e., an online method of class delivery in response to school closure, may lead to a decline in the physical fitness of adolescents.",

The change is making physical education teachers adapt quickly to the new class environment, which demands a devoted effort [15] . In addition, the support of the government and educational institutions through policies is required, due to the deterioration in adolescent health [9, 16] . In France, teachers have strengthened all policy capabilities to increase students' outof-school PAs; however, in Italy and Turkey, guidelines have proposed a reduction in out-of-school PA [17] . The Korean Ministry of Education has provided physical education teachers with options for online physical education classes to choose physical activity types: (1) asynchronous online class (content-focused class), (2) synchronous online class (real-time bilateral class), and (3) assignment-oriented class [4] . However, teachers in charge of practical classes, such as PE, have difficulty in selecting an online class type that can cope with field-oriented active classes. Additionally, the selection of teaching methods in PE depends on the PE teachers; therefore, the influence on students may differ according to the nature of the online PE classes. Therefore, based on the online teaching method chosen, PA will be emphasized or restricted.",

Tabata exercise is considered a suitable form of exercise for adolescents who need MVPA activity because it can be performed at high intensity in a short period while including the four conditions mentioned above [19] . In previous studies, it was reported that face-to-face Tabata exercise [20] and online home-based exercise programs [21] have a positive effect on increasing physical activity in adolescents. PE is the only subject that includes PA in the Korean middle school education curriculum [22, 23] . PA during PE classes can significantly influence the growth of adolescents, such as improving their physical strength, health, and athletic ability. Thus, it is necessary to investigate the effects of online PE classes during COVID-19. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of an online PE class on middle-school students' physical fitness.",

Tabata training is a type of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) in which participants exercise for 20 s and rest for 10 s. Eight motions are performed per session, and it consists of three sessions of 14 min. For the present study, each session was given a 1 min rest, and a 10 s low-intensity exercise form (walking in place) was given after 20 s with maximum exercise intensity (RPE 15 or more) [20] . Before exercising, the students performed a warm-up exercise (dynamic stretching) for 10 min and a cool-down exercise (static stretching) for 10 min post-exercise. The time for online class net environment check, attendance check, and notice was included (6 min) since the exercise program applied to the synchronous online class was conducted in a regular class format. The PE teacher motivated the students to perform as many exercise movements as possible. For 10 weeks, 40 min of class was conducted twice a week (see Table S1 ).",

The situation of COVID-19 requires a survey on the effects of transitions in the PE class environment of Korean middle school students, from face-to-face to online classes. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of synchronous online PE classes for Tabata training and PE-centered asynchronous online class on the physical strength of adolescents. For the first time, we designed a new study based on Tabata training adopted by Domaradzki et al. [20] and established the relationship between the effects of Tabata training exercise in online classes and the physical fitness of adolescents. The present study showed that the synchronous online class, which was conducted on Tabata training twice a week for 10 weeks, had positive effects on body composition, muscle strength, and balance.",

Racil et al. [32] reported that the 10-week HIIT was more effective than moderate-intensity interval training in the body composition of obese adolescents. Domaradzki et al. [20] reported that high-intensity Tabata training for 10 weeks had a positive effect on the body composition of overweight adolescents and body composition changes in normal-weight adolescents. This study was conducted to verify the effect of high-intensity Tabata training, which is centered on resistance exercise, on adolescents who have normal weight in online PE classes. As a result of checking the body composition after 10 weeks of online PE classes, the interaction effect between the times and the groups was shown in the muscle mass, and a significant difference between the time points, BMI, and body fat was confirmed. Therefore, Tabata training positively affects body composition in online PE classes, a finding that is similar to previous studies. However, unlike previous studies, the BMI and body fat in both groups increased; the increase is believed to be related to a decrease in overall PA and changes in the eating habits of adolescents [16] . In particular, the reason for the increase in BMI, body fat, and muscle mass in SOCG is the Tabata exercise program since there was no difference in eating habits compared to AOCG; however, there is a possibility that the muscle mass increased after exercise. Based on our findings, it is necessary to specifically review the variables that have the greatest influence on body composition during COVID-19 in future studies by adding PA and eating habits.",

A decrease in muscle strength in adolescence has been shown to affect the increase in muscle-to-fat mass ratio (MFR) [33] , deformation of the musculoskeletal system [34] , and cardiovascular disease and mortality in middle age [35] . Therefore, online PE classes should be conducted to maintain the physical activity of adolescents, even during COVID-19. Our study focused on improving the physical fitness of adolescents, especially their strength. It focused on increasing vigorous PA, which is pointed out as a disadvantage in online classes. The results confirmed that there was a difference in muscle strength according to the teaching method used. Particularly, the hip and knee muscle strength improved in the SOCG. In previous studies, Tabata training was applied to school PE classes, and it was effective in improving the strength and physical fitness of the students participating in the study [20, 30] . However, this study applied Tabata training to online PE classes for the first time. This proved that Tabata training effectively maintains and improves students' muscular strength in online PE classes. Moliner-Urdiales [36] emphasized high-intensity PA to strengthen adolescents' lower body strength and argued that it is necessary to consider PE class time in schools. Our program is suitable for online PE class methods, improving the physical strength of adolescents during COVID-19 as a basis for improving lower body muscle strength. As the research results suggest, out-of-school PA for students should be emphasized, and real-time online physical education classes can be an alternative to increase out-of-school PA.",

The balancing ability of adolescents is affected by their physical fitness level [37] and isometric strength of the lower extremities [39] , being closely related to lower extremity injuries in adolescents [40] . Particularly, sedentary life can reduce adolescents' posture control and balance ability [41] , and a decrease in physical strength related to balance can weaken the ability to sense body position in space, increasing the duration of compensation exercises for body stabilization. The balance of Korean adolescents decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic period, and there was a difference according to gender [6] . Chtourou et al. [42] should focus on restoring motor function through muscle strength, balance training, and routine activities during COVID-19. Training is needed to recover the damaged balance due to a reduction in exercise and proprioceptive sensation [43, 44] . A previous study reported that high-intensity intervaltype exercise is effective in improving the dynamic balance ability of the general public [45] ; particularly, it is effective in improving the overall reach of YBT in subjects with sedentary type 1 diabetes mellitus [46] , and in sedentary university students [47] .

Although various online PE methods have been applied to adolescents in Korea, our research results suggest that synchronous online PE classes are more effective in increasing PA and maintaining physical fitness levels in adolescents. When the COVID-19 situation improves slightly, students will return to school and participate in various sports activities. Adequate strength and balance skills are essential to participating in various sports, and our program should be adapted to the youth as a beneficial fitness training to prepare them for post-COVID-19 times to prevent sports injuries.",

In particular, the fact that there was no effect on cardiorespiratory fitness was related to students' concentration during in-class participation and the type of exercise program. Second, we did not directly measure the PA level of adolescents, which is also considered a limitation of this study. Third, although various types of online PE classes are being introduced in Korea, this study only analyzed the effects of two online PE methods. Further studies should investigate the amount of change in PA among adolescents during the pandemic, program interventions of various types of exercise on online PE classes, and the effect between genders.",

As a result, the physical composition, muscle strength, and balance ability of these adolescents improved. In conclusion, a synchronous online PE class can be considered a suitable online PE method for adolescents during COVID-19. An exercise program of less than 40 min (regular class time is 40 min), a PE teacher's understanding of exercise, the concentration of students participating in online PE classes, an appropriate network environment and appropriate equipment are required to conduct successful synchronous online classes. Most importantly, the role of physical education teachers in a situation such as COVID-19 must change from that of a physical education instructor to that of a PA planner. In addition, real-time online physical education classes are one way to emphasize out-of-school PA. Further, each country's policy stance must be consistent to activate out-of-school PA. Further studies should develop an exercise program to be applied to online PE classes other than Tabata training, and a program should be created to check whether the youth participating in online PE classes perform the exercises correctly. Moreover, a future online PE system should be established to prepare for the upcoming second wave of COVID-19.",
