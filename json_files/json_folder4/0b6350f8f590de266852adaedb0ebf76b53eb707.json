            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is responsible for the worldwide unpredictable pandemic situation. To date (9 November 2021), statistical data indicated~250 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and over 5 million deaths globally (https://ourworldindata.org, accessed on 9 November 2021). COVID-19 patients typically exhibit clinical symptoms such as a fever, headache, dry cough, shortness of breath, and severe fatigue [1, 2] . Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome commonly manifests as a variety of persistent symptoms, such as severe fatigue, shortness of breath [3] , headache, and attention disorder [4] , that occur beyond 4 weeks from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms [5] . Recently, Mehta et al. [6] suggested that the residual abnormalities in health status after Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 1992 2 of 14 COVID-19 might, in part, be a consequence of the acute phase, pathological immune system response to ongoing infection known as the \"cytokine storm\". In addition, it has recently been reported that viral infection induces an excessive proinflammatory response, including increased oxidative stress and apoptosis, which may be contributing factors to the etiology and pathogenesis of COVID-19 [7] . Similarly, Cumpstey et al. [8] described COVID-19 as a redox disease because an inflammation-driven \"oxidative storm\" alters the redox landscape, eliciting mitochondrial, metabolic, endothelial, and immune dysfunction. Importantly, Xu et al. [9] reported that augmented airway resistance, already associated with elevated proinflammatory interleukin-6 [10] , may be considered a contributing factor that causes the increased mechanical work of breathing and leads to dyspnea and further COVID-19 progression.",

Interestingly, Smith [13] formulated the \"cytokine hypothesis of overtraining\" more than 20 years ago, highlighting the negative role of elevated circulating proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1\u03b2, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha) on whole body regulation, inducing \"sickness\" behavior and a decline in performance.",

According to the operation manual, the H 2 generator provides H 2 at 99.99% purity, produced via purified water electrolysis using a membrane electrode assembly/proton exchange membrane. Inhalation of 100% H 2 produced by a H 2 generator through a nasal cannula, even at low flow rates (250 mL/min), was demonstrated to be an effective method of H 2 administration [43] . Participants could not distinguish between the inhalation of H 2 and placebo because H 2 is colorless, odorless, and tasteless [29] . H 2 or placebo were inhaled during two (morning and afternoon) 60-min home sessions under resting conditions. To our knowledge, there is a lack of studies from which the optimal duration of H 2 inhalation for rehabilitation after COVID-19 can be derived. In general, rehabilitation after COVID-19 ranged from 5 days to 6 months [44] . In sports medicine, the duration of H 2 administration prior to exercise ranged from 30 min to 4 weeks [45] . Therefore, we chose a 14-day H 2 /placebo intervention as a compromise to keep the duration long enough to reveal a detectable effect on physical and respiratory outcomes, yet acceptably short for study compliance.",

An analysis of variance (ANOVA) with intervention and sex factors was used for the age variable.

The significance of the change value from zero was evaluated using a one-sample t-test.

The association between the 6 MWT change and the changes in respiratory variables (FVC, FEV1, and FEV1/FVC) was evaluated using the Pearson's correlation coefficient.

            "text": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first randomized, placebo-controlled study to examine whether home-based H 2 inhalation therapy (2 \u00d7 60 min/day, for 14 days) could improve respiratory and physical function during early recovery in acute post-COVID-19 patients. The main findings of this novel study are as follows: H 2 inhalation compared to placebo induced an (1) There is a growing body of evidence that physical function is impaired following both COVID-19 [12, 16] and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [46] that persists for several weeks or months post-infection. It has been well documented that a sedentary lifestyle is generally associated with lower physical fitness [47] . In this regard, a considerable reduction in the amount of physical activity due to quarantine and social contact restrictions, due to the COVID-19 pandemic [48] , may have a negative deconditioning effect on physical functioning that is similar to the effects of a sedentary lifestyle in COVID-19 patients. The 6 MWT is widely accepted as \"a gold standard\" for cardiorespiratory capacity, primarily in patients with chronic respiratory disease [18] , and has been considered as an appropriate test to triage COVID-19 patients [14] . Our results showed that pre-intervention distance covered during the 6 MWT was 679 m (107%) for males and 666 m (114%) for females according to reference values adjusted for age and sex [40] . Our cohort of acute post-COVID-19 participants exhibited generally good physical function, despite still experiencing persisting symptoms, such as fatigue, dyspnea, or muscle soreness (Table 4) , up to 26 days, on average, after a positive PCR test. Townsend et al. [49] , who assessed patients aged~50 years and with greater COVID-19 severity, reported a 6 MWT distance of~460 m, which was below the healthy population performance level [50] . Surprisingly, the 6 MWT result was not associated with either initial disease severity or respiratory complications after 75 days of diagnosis [49] . On the other hand, Blanco et al. [51] reported a significantly better result for the 6 MWT (~577 m) in older patients (~55 years old) with less severe COVID-19 up to 104 days after the onset of symptoms. In another study, Baranauskas et al. [52] found no significant differences in physical function between post-COVID-19 patients and the control group; however, the post-COVID-19 patients had impaired postexercise autonomic cardiac regulation up to 3 months after diagnosis. Based on our results and the above evidence from the literature, deteriorated post-COVID-19 physical function tends to improve a few weeks or months after the onset of symptoms, but residual health abnormalities associated with infection may still persist. Impaired physical fitness, as well as long-lasting fatigue, during post-acute COVID-19 phase may have a common denominator-oxidative stress. Coronavirus induced oxidative stress and its related negative consequences on cellular homeostasis, including a redox dysbalance, and deteriorated mitochondrial functions and ATP productions [8, 11, 53] , which have long been associated with both fatigue [54] and with decline in physical fitness [55] . In this context, H 2 has repeatedly been considered a strong selective antioxidant [20, 21] with the ability to protect mitochondrial respiratory function and ATP production [20, 56, 57] , as well as being a suitable agent for the treatment of temporary and chronic forms of oxidative-stress-associated fatigue [58] . The most important finding of the present study is that 14 days of H 2 inhalation, performed at home, resulted in an improvement in physical function compared to the placebo group, irrespective of sex and age. Specifically, the distance covered during the 6 MWT was extended by 64 m after H 2 therapy, whereas there was only a 9 m increase in the placebo group. An increased distance of 30 m for the 6 MWT has previously been established as the minimal clinically important improvement in adults with chronic respiratory diseases [18] . Hence, we suggest that 2 weeks of daily H 2 inhalation resulted in a clinically relevant improvement in physical function in our cohort of acute post-COVID-19 patients. From an improved physical fitness standpoint, the antifatigue effect of H 2 demonstrated in the present study has already been documented in other studies examining different modes of exercise in a healthy population [26, 27] , well-trained athletes [25, 45, 59] , and animal models [24] . The antifatigue effect of H 2 supplementation was explained by its ability to stimulate oxidative metabolism, reduce oxidative stress, adjust the cellular redox environment and improve immune function. Interestingly, the improvements in 6 MWT distance and in the respiratory variables were independent of sex and age. It appears that the law of initial values did not play a role here. If the law of initial values were valid, then the improvement should depend on the pretest value and, therefore, on age, because the 6 MWT distance, FVC, and FEV1 were age-dependent (Table 3) . However, this result should be interpreted with caution as it may be due to insufficient sample size. In addition, the changes after 14 days of H 2 inhalation may be dependent on the severity of COVID-19. Therefore, further studies with a larger sample size stratified by COVID-19 severity are needed to verify this result.",

However, only the H 2 group demonstrated a clinically relevant improvement in distance walked. In this situation, one would expect that a faster walking pace would be associated with a higher RPE. Borg's RPE has traditionally been interpreted as reflecting a complex feedback mechanism that is modulated by a variety of physiological functions, including HR rhythm, minute ventilation and breathing frequency, muscle and joint stiffness, and central fatigue [60] . Therefore, we suggest that daily H 2 inhalation could induce a higher perceived tolerability (resistance) to increased walking pace in our acute post-COVID-19 patients. In addition, our results show that H 2 gas inhalation had a beneficial effect on respiratory function, and the H 2 -induced improvement in FVC was associated with gain in cardiorespiratory capacity. We propose that the positive functional changes induced by H 2 inhalation may be attributed to the higher perceived tolerability to the cardiorespiratory test in our participants. An increased tolerability to high exercise intensity was previously reported by Botek et al. [61] , who found a lower lactate response and improved ventilatory efficiency after pre-exercise H 2 application.",

[36] , who applied 6 L/min of H 2 -O 2 (66%-33%) in an experimental group of COVID-19 patients and a similar dose of O 2 in a control group. H 2 -O 2 inhalation resulted in a significantly reduced disease severity, including reduced dyspnea, coughing, chest distress, and pain. Improvements were rapid and were demonstrated after the second and third days, as well as at the end of the treatment, compared to the control group. The clinical benefits of H 2 -O 2 administration have been attributed to the ability to reduce inspiratory efforts due to a considerably lower resistance to air when passing through the respiratory tract [62] . Lau et al. [63] showed that 6 weeks of a well-supervised exercise training program in~40-year-old patients recovering from SARS induced a significant improvement in the 6 MWT distance of 77 m (baseline distance 590 m). This improvement in walking distance is almost the same as our result; however, H 2 therapy is potentially a threefold more time-efficient rehabilitation approach than exercise training when it comes to improving 6 MWT performance for acute post-COVID-19 patients.",

Therefore, studies investigating the combination of H 2 administration with other rehabilitation programs would be important future work. H 2 administration seems to be a healthy, safe [20, 29, 65] , well-tolerated therapeutic approach with no clinically significant health issues reported in animal model [37, 43] .
