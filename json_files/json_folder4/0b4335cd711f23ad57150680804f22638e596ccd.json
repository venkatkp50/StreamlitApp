Self-management interventions can teach patients skills and behaviours to manage their disease. Technology-mediated interventions have the potential to provide easily accessible support for disease self-management. We evaluated the effectiveness of a web-based self-management intervention, focused on physical activity promotion, on exercise capacity in COPD. This 6-month randomised controlled trial (NCT02099799) enrolled 153 persons with COPD at two US sites (VABoston, n=108; VABirmingham, n=45). Participants were allocated (1:1) to the webbased self-management intervention (physical activity promotion through personalised, progressive step-count goals, feedback, online COPD-related education and social support via an online community) or usual care. The primary outcome was exercise capacity (6-min walk distance (6 MWD)). Secondary outcomes included physical activity (daily steps per day), HRQoL (St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire Total Score), dyspnoea, COPD-related knowledge and social support. Change in step-count goals reflected intervention engagement. Participants' mean age was 69 (SD=7), and mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s % predicted was 61% (SD=21%). Change in 6MWD did not differ between groups. Intervention participants improved their mean daily step counts by 1312 more than those in the usual care group ( p<0.001). Groups did not differ on other secondary outcomes. VABirmingham participants were significantly more engaged with the intervention, although site did not modify the effect of the intervention on 6MWD or secondary outcomes. The intervention did not improve exercise capacity but improved physical activity at 6 months. Additional intervention modifications are needed to optimise its COPD self-management capabilities.",

Patients with COPD are limited in their exercise capacity, which can result in deleterious downstream effects including reduced physical activity and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) [4] . With no cure, proactive self-management of COPD is critical to maintaining or improving health outcomes [5] . Ultimate goals of COPD self-management include optimising and preserving exercise capacity, reducing symptoms and functional impairments in daily life, and increasing emotional and social well-being, and HRQoL. Self-management interventions for COPD are often multicomponent, structured and personalised programmes with goals of motivating, engaging and supporting patients to adopt positive health behaviours (e.g. physical activity) and develop skills to better manage their disease [6, 7] . Technology-based platforms may offer a promising approach to promote disease self-management and bring interventions directly to patients [8, 9] . Such solutions are particularly relevant during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic when many in-person programmes are closed. Rigorous examination of how effective technology-based self-management interventions are in promoting key COPD outcomes, such as exercise capacity, is needed [10] .",

In the current randomised controlled trial (RCT), we extend our previous work in two ways: 1) the duration of the intervention was increased to 6 months to assess if it could improve exercise capacity in addition to physical activity; and 2) we enrolled COPD participants at two geographically distinct study sites to assess response to the intervention in a heterogeneous cohort. Our primary hypothesis was that participants assigned to the intervention would demonstrate significant improvements in exercise capacity compared to controls at 6 months. Our secondary hypothesis was that participants in the intervention group would demonstrate significant improvements in other COPD self-management outcomes (HRQoL, dyspnoea, physical activity, disease education, social support and occurrence of acute exacerbations) compared to controls. Some of the results of this study have been previously reported in the form of an abstract [18] .",

The intervention showed no significant change in the primary outcome, exercise capacity, despite having participants enrolled in the study for a duration of 6 months, which is longer than our prior work [11, 13] . Extending our previous work at a single site [11, 13] , this dual-site study demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful increases in daily physical activity (1312 steps/day) in the intervention compared to the control group, independent of lung function and site. This change exceeds findings from both our prior studies (779 [11] to 804 [13] steps/day) and the minimum clinically important difference for daily step counts in COPD [32, 33] . There were no significant changes in HRQoL, dyspnoea, COPD knowledge, social support or acute exacerbations compared to controls. We hypothesised that use of the web-based intervention across 6 months would significantly improve exercise capacity, demonstrated by increased 6MWD. While we found strong evidence that our intervention improved physical activity, this improvement did not translate to improved exercise capacity. Previous research has shown weak correlations between exercise capacity and physical activity [30] . Exercise capacity, as measured by the episodic 6MWD, represents what the patient can do. Physical activity, integrated over time and in the home environment, represents what the patient does do, accounting for many factors (e.g. psychosocial, environmental) other than the underlying COPD that may impact physical activity [31] .",

Our self-management intervention did not include an aerobic exercise training component as the goal was to promote walking, which most patients with COPD can do. The importance of exercise training can be seen in the PHYSACTO trial [33] , which examined the effects of a self-management intervention coupled with placebo or tiotropium/olodaterol and with or without high intensity, in-person exercise training. The combination of a self-management intervention with pharmacological treatment and exercise training resulted in the greatest improvements in exercise capacity compared to self-management with placebo, or self-management with pharmacological treatment (and no exercise training) [33] . Similarly, a community-based exercise programme (including walking, cycling and strength exercises) coupled with a self-management programme (COPE-active) resulted in significant between-group differences in both exercise capacity and physical activity after 12 months [34] . An important difference between the current study and the PHYSACTO and COPE-active trials is that our self-management intervention, fully automated and remotely delivered, could be accessed by those who cannot attend in-person programmes.",

Our technologymediated intervention increased physical activity but not exercise capacity; this is in line with other technology-mediated trials which also used a more self-guided internet-mediated physical activity intervention [35] . In a contrasting example, VORRINK et al. [36] had participants who recently completed pulmonary rehabilitation use a smartphone app-mediated physical activity intervention for 12 months, with a physiotherapist-facing component that allowed for personalised text messaging. In that study, participants decreased physical activity but were able to maintain their post-rehabilitation exercise capacity levels [36] . DEMEYER et al. [37] found increases in both physical activity and 6MWD in an intervention that included interviews with the investigator to discuss motivation, barriers, favourite activities and strategies to become more active. In addition, automatically updated goals could be changed by the research staff, and participants received text messages with activity proposals from the investigator, taking local weather into account. In our study, we had contact with the participant only when we called them weekly to give them their step-count goals and during the 3-and 6-month study visits. Taken together, it appears that technology-mediated interventions can be more widely accessible, but conventional in-person programmes, or a combination of both, may be more motivating and engaging given the accountability of in-person contact with healthcare professionals. Since one size does not fit all, it is important to develop and evaluate as many interventions as possible to give patients choices to support their exercise capacity, physical activity and COPD self-management. It is important to identify the type of programme that would allow for the greatest adherence and engagement for the unique circumstances of an individual patient.",

The majority of participants looked at their step-count graphs, though almost half of participants indicated they did not look at the motivational and educational tips, and most participants did not look at the online forum.

However, there was some evidence to suggest that for those assigned to the intervention, sites differed in their level of engagement with the physical activity promotion component. The differences observed in engagement by site may be explained by the notable differences in their sample characteristics and recruitment strategies. BIR participants appeared more limited by their disease (i.e. lower average 6MWD, FEV 1 % predicted and daily step counts at baseline) compared to BOS and thus may have more potential for improvement. Additionally, BIR participants were recruited pragmatically by their usual provider, whereas BOS participants were recruited with a less personal approach through mailings by research staff. Thus, BIR patients may have been more motivated to increase their walking because of their personal connection with the provider recruiting for the research study. Recruitment at BIR may have been influenced by selection bias since participants who were more likely to be successful or engaged in the intervention may have been enrolled.",

Current guidelines for the 6MWT, published in 2014, recommend a practice walk 24 h before the actual test [41] . When we started this study in 2015, we chose not to include a practice walk to reduce participant burden and not require travel to the medical centre on six separate occasions (twice at baseline, 3 months and 6 months). Because we did not ask participants to perform a practice walk, there was a possibility that the within-group increase in 6MWD from baseline to 6 months in both groups could be attributable to a learning effect. However, it is known that this learning effect dissipates after 3 months [41] . We evaluated change in 6MWD after 6 months; therefore, any learning effect is likely to be even less. Additionally, although 6MWD consistently increased at the second walk test performed 2-5 days apart, SPENCER et al. [42] demonstrated that changes in 6MWD at 3 months compared to baseline after pulmonary rehabilitation did not differ significantly from each other regardless of whether one chose the first, second or better 6MWD at each time point. Thus, our results examining change scores at 6 months are unlikely to be different had practice walks been performed. While the study expanded our past work with a more socioeconomically diverse sample, our cohort was self-selected and majority white male, limiting generalisability in some respects. The 6-month study period extends our prior work, and it is promising that significant improvements in daily step counts were maintained. Future work should extend the follow-up period beyond 6 months, focus on exercise intensity to optimise effects on exercise capacity and maximise engagement with other components of the intervention.",
