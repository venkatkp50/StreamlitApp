In addition, scholars propose that those patients suspected to have COVID-19 and patients with COVID-19 experiencing only mild symptoms should prevent interaction with other household members by isolating themselves in a hotel (5) . The hotel, coordinated by a tertiary referral hospital and attended the preventive medicine regulations, not only as a public health resource for the containment of COVID-19 but also as more than a place for quarantining in Madrid (6) . Further, there is increasing worry from frontline healthcare workers (HCW) about contracting the virus and contaminating loved ones (7) . To prevent the transmission of the virus and protect parents and/or children from the epidemic, HCW and suspected COVID-19 patients, need temporary quarantine from their families. A quarantine hotel is a possible solution to address this demand for temporary quarantine accommodation. Prior literatures also discussed about the role of quarantine hotels associated with the use of preventive protocols in hospitals to reduce the occurrence of hospital outbreaks. The authors reveal the hospitals and hotels have common characteristics, such as individual rooms and toilets, which made the quarantine hotels not only a viable solution for the containment of COVID-19, but for the caring of patients and HCWs (6, 8) . Quarantine hotels are a community-based public health intervention designed to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 within the community.",

Mid-pandemic, as the hospitality industry introduces the quarantine hotel, their \"corporate social responsibility\" quickly adopts the market-driven strategy to control, educate and manage the basic services in demand. The designated quarantine hotel is a short-term \"corporate social responsibility\" strategy in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. It also potentially accelerates a new era of development of \"corporate social responsibility\" in the long-term marketing strategy.",

First, enhance the insertion of robotics technology and artificial intelligence (AI) into the hotel industry. The increased emphasis on physical social distancing and decreasing personal contact are significant measures to reduce transmission of diseases. The quarantine hotel provides three meals a day via services that avoid contact with guests. In the future, hotels can apply AI and robotics technology to positions such as bellboy, busboy and room service to avoid personal contact, while still maintaining service standards.",

This demonstrates altruism and egoism, which is a win-win corporate social responsibility marketing strategy.
