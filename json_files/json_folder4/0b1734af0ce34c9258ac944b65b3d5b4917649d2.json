            "text": "The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a severe, ongoing, novel pandemic that emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. As of January 21, 2021, the virus had infected approximately 100 million people, causing over 2 million deaths. This article analyzed several time series forecasting methods to predict the spread of COVID-19 during the pandemic's second wave in Italy (the period after October 13, 2020). The autoregressive moving average (ARIMA) model, innovations state space models for exponential smoothing (ETS), the neural network autoregression (NNAR) model, the trigonometric exponential smoothing state space model with Box-Cox transformation, ARMA errors, and trend and seasonal components (TBATS), and all of their feasible hybrid combinations were employed to forecast the number of patients hospitalized with mild symptoms and the number of patients hospitalized in the intensive care units (ICU). The data for the period February 21, 2020-October 13, 2020 were extracted from the website of the Italian Ministry of Health (www. salute. gov. it). The results showed that (i) hybrid models were better at capturing the linear, nonlinear, and seasonal pandemic patterns, significantly outperforming the respective single models for both time series, and (ii) the numbers of COVID-19-related hospitalizations of patients with mild symptoms and in the ICU were projected to increase rapidly from October 2020 to mid-November 2020. According to the estimations, the necessary ordinary and intensive care beds were expected to double in 10 days and to triple in approximately 20 days. These predictions were consistent with the observed trend, demonstrating that hybrid models may facilitate public health authorities' decision-making, especially in the short-term.",

COVID-19-related hospitalization trends offer a clear picture of the overall pressure on the national healthcare system. Moreover, models fitted to hospitalized patients are usually more reliable and accurate than models fitted to confirmed cases [30] . 1 The paper's second goal is to compare and investigate the accuracy of several statistical methods.",

Considering only the linear trend of a time series, they are able to capture both nonseasonal and seasonal patterns of that series. The following should be noted regarding the nonseasonal component of ARIMA models: (i) the autoregressive (AR) process aims to forecast a time series using a linear combination of its past values; (ii) the differencing (I) is required to make the time series stationary by removing (or mitigating) trend or seasonality (if any), and (iii) the moving average (MA) process aims to forecast future values using a linear combination of previous forecast errors. The seasonal component is similar to the nonseasonal component, but implies backshifts of the seasonal period, i.e., adding the seasonal parameters to the AR, I, and MA components, which allows the model to handle most of the seasonal patterns in the real-world data. Therefore, the final seasonal model can be denoted as ARIMA (p,q,d)(P,Q,D) m , where m is the seasonal period and the lowercase and uppercase letters indicate the number of nonseasonal and seasonal parameters for each of its three components, respectively [34] , Sect. 8).",

The basic ETS model consists of two main equations: a forecast equation and a smoothing equation. By integrating these two equations into an innovation state space model, which may correspond to the additive (A) or multiplicative (M) error assumption, it is possible to obtain an observation/measurement equation and a transition/state equation, respectively. 2 The first equation describes the observed data while the second equation describes the behavior of the unobserved states. The states refer to the level, trend, and seasonality. The trend and seasonal components may be none (N), additive (A), additive damped (Ad), 3 or multiplicative (M), resulting in a wide range of model combinations. The final model assumes the form of a three-character string (Z,Z,Z), where the first letter identifies the error assumption of the state space model, the second letter identifies the trend type, and the third letter identifies the season type. These models are able to produce a time series forecast by using the weighted average of its past values and adding more weight to recent observations [34] , Sect. 7, [40] .",

In fact, since the best weighting procedure has not been established, I adopted a parsimonious approach and chose the one that performed better. Specifically, I tested the overall goodness-of-fit of all models with four common forecast accuracy measures: MAE, MAPE, mean absolute scaled error (MASE), and root mean square error (RMSE).",

Specifically, MAE and RMSE are both scale-dependent measures, although based on different errors. MAE is easier to interpret because minimizing it leads to predictions of the median, while minimizing RMSE leads to predictions of the mean. In fact, if the first metric is based on absolute errors, the second is based on squared errors. MAPE is probably the most widely employed error measure [27, 47] , and unlike MAE and RMSE, it is not scale-dependent because it is based on percentage errors. Thus, it has the advantage of being a unit-free metric. However, it also requires some critical considerations. For example, it can lead to biased forecasts because it gives infinite or undefined results when one or more time series data point equals 0, and it puts a heavier penalty on negative errors (i.e., when predicted values are higher than actual values) than on positive errors. Finally, MASE, which was proposed by Hyndman and Koehler [36] , is a scale-free error metric and probably the most versatile and reliable measure of forecast accuracy. It is superior to MAPE in that it does not give infinite or undefined values and can be used to compare forecast accuracy both on single and multiple time series. 13 Since each model thus entails",

Table 2 reports the best selected parameters for the single models 14 while Tables 3 and 4 include the forecast accuracy measures for the single and hybrid models. 15 For patients hospitalized with mild symptoms (Table 2) , the optimal single models were the seasonal ARIMA (1,2,3) (0,0,1) 7 , ETS (A,Ad,N), 16 NNAR (7,1,4) 7 , and TBATS (0.428, {2,2}, 1, {< 7,2 >}). 17 For patients hospitalized in the ICU (Table 2) , the optimal single models were the seasonal ARIMA (1,2,2) (0,0,1) 7 , ETS (A,A,N), 18 NNAR (6,1,4) 7 , and (T)BATS (0.427,{0,0},1,\u2212). 19 The hybrid models were derived by combining the optimal single models with equal weights, which proved to be more suitable than weights based on error values. 20 In particular, for patients hospitalized with mild symptoms, the most accurate single model was NNAR, followed by seasonal ARIMA, while the best hybrid model was NNAR-TBATS, followed by ARIMA-NNAR, and ARIMA-NNAR-TBATS. For patients hospitalized in the ICU, the best single model was NNAR, followed by 14 The parameter values of the ARIMA, ETS, and TBATS models were reported in Tables A1, A2 , and A3 (Appendix A). 15 As suggested by Hyndman [38] , since the time series covered less than year and had daily observations, the frequency was set to 7, which allowed for weekly seasonality. 16 The selected ETS model is also known as the damped trend method with additive errors. 17 The estimated TBATS model was derived by applying a Box-Cox transformation of 0.428, an ARMA{2,2} process for modeling errors, a damping parameter of 1 (doing nothing), and two Fourier pairs with seasonal periods of 7. 18 The selected ETS model is also known as Holt's linear trend method. In this case, both error and trend were additive. 19 In this case, the \"tbats()\" algorithm gave a BATS model that differed from TBATS only in the way that it modeled seasonality. In particular, it did not implement the Fourier series to model seasonality. For simplicity, the notation TBATS was used for the discussion of hybrid models forecasting patients hospitalized in the ICU. This model employed a Box-Cox transformation of 0.427, no ARMA {0,0} errors, and a damping parameter of 1 (doing nothing). 20 The forecast performance measures of the hybrid models combined with the cross-validation procedure were reported in the Appendix B (Tables B1 and B2) . With regard to patients hospitalized with mild symptoms and patients hospitalized in the ICU, the models derived using equal weights outperformed those obtained with crossvalidated errors in 26 and 31 (out of 33) performance accuracy metrics, respectively Tables B3 and B4. ARIMA, while the best hybrid model was ARIMA-NNAR, followed by ARIMA-ETS-NNAR, and ETS-NNAR. 21 Autocorrelation function (ACF) indicated that current values were not correlated with previous values at lag 1 (Tables 2 and 3 ). In fact, the correlation coefficient between one point and the next in the time series ranged from \u2212 0.07 to 0.19 for patients hospitalized with mild symptoms and from \u2212 0.16 to 0.31 for patients in the ICU. The highest values (0.19 and 0.31) were obtained for the TBATS model. 22 According to Lewis' [52] interpretation, since MAPE was always significantly lower than 10, all predictive models can be considered as highly accurate. Moreover, MASE was much lower than 1 for all models; therefore, all the proposed forecasting approaches performed significantly better than the forecasts from the (no-change) \"na\u00efve\" methods, i.e., the forecasts with no adjustments for casual factors (Hyndman and Koehler 2006) , which justifies the use of more complex and sophisticated models.",

            "text": "Tables 5 and 6 compare the hybrid models with the respective single models considering the minimization of MAE, MAPE, MASE, and RMSE metrics. For patients hospitalized with mild symptoms, the hybrid models outperformed the respective single models in 98 out of 112 metrics, i.e., on 87.5% of all the forecast accuracy measures. For patients hospitalized in the ICU, the hybrid models outperformed the respective single models in 81 out of 112 metrics, i.e., on 72.3% of all measures. In the latter case, however, almost all losses of efficiency (25 out 31) were attributable to NNAR. 23 Thus, the hybrid models generally increased forecast accuracy, but this increase was more evident for patients hospitalized with mild symptoms. The best hybrid model for patients hospitalized with mild symptoms-NNAR-TBATS-outperformed the single NNAR and TBATS models by 5.63-9.23% on MAE and 5.88-9.95% on RMSE. While, the best hybrid model for patients hospitalized in the ICU-ARIMA-NNARoutperformed the single ARIMA and NNAR models by 1.2-8.67% on MAE, and 2.81-11.44% on RMSE. Figures 3  and 4 graphically represent the models for both time series ranked by the MAE and RMSE metrics. 21 In particular, ARIMA-ETS-NNAR and ETS-NNAR models exhibited nearly identical accuracy. 22 Tables C1 and C2 (Appendix C) also reported the results of Ljung-Box's [54] test for residual autocorrelation using no more than 10 lags, as suggested by Ljung [53] when the sample size is not large. The output showed that for patients hospitalized with mild symptoms, ARIMA, TBATS, and all hybrid models, except for ETS-TBATS, had no autocorrelation issue, while single ETS and NNAR exhibited some autocorrelation, especially at lags 8 and 10. With regard to patients hospitalized in the ICU, ARIMA and most of hybrid models, except for ARIMA-TBATS, ETS-TBATS, and ARIMA-ETS-TBATS, had no particular signs of autocorrelation. In contrast, single ETS, NNAR, and TBATS showed some problems at lags 8 and 10. 23 This did not change the meaning of the results because, as confirmed by Table C2 (Appendix C), the residuals of the hybrid model's output were generally less affected by autocorrelation than were those for NNAR. Figures 5 and 6 show the best six models and the remaining nine models for patients hospitalized with mild symptoms, respectively. Similarly, Figs. 7 and 8 show the best six models and the remaining nine models for patients hospitalized in the ICU, respectively. The light blue area in each graph shows the prediction intervals at 80%, while the dark blue area shows the prediction intervals at 95%. 24 The forecasts of the best single and hybrid models anticipated an increase in the number of patients hospitalized with mild symptoms and in the number of patients admitted to the ICU over the next 30 days, i.e., from October 14, 2020, to November 12, 2020. This predicted trend was also confirmed by the remaining estimated models.",

For patients hospitalized in the ICU, Fig. 11 reveals that ARIMA-NNAR, NNAR-TBATS, 25 Values are rounded to the nearest integer. The predicted values of the six best models for patients hospitalized with mild symptoms and in the ICU were reported in Table D1 and D2 (Appendix D), respectively. and ARIMA-NNAR-TBATS hybrid models also fit the observed data quite well. All estimated models generally exhibited a strong match between predictions and observed data, except for ETS, NNAR, and ETS-TBATS, where the trends differed (Figs. 11 and 12) . Notably, the models with lowest loss of efficiency adapted better to the observed data, which confirms the consistency and robustness of the statistical approach.",

Notes: The models were ranked (from seventh to fifteenth place) on the MAE metric measures and increasing the number of ordinary and intensive care beds, hiring additional healthcare personnel, and buying care facilities, protective equipment, and ventilators to fight the infection and reduce deaths. 26 Meanwhile, the opportunity to implement more or less restrictive non-pharmaceutical interventions (NIPs) to tackle the pandemicsuch as social distancing, travel bans, the use of face masks, hand hygiene, and bar and restaurant restrictions [20] should be evaluated carefully in light of these measures' potentially negative economic impacts. In fact, according to Fitch Rating's [24] previsions, the first wave of COVID-19 and the consequent massive lockdown measures may already have caused up to a 9.5% contraction in Italy's 2020 GDP. Fig. 8 The remaining nine forecast models for predicting patients hospitalized in the ICU. Notes: the models were ranked (from seventh to fifteenth place) on the MAE metric While the models with the lowest loss of efficiency seemed to adapt substantially well to the observed data in the forecast window, the predictions should, in general, be treated with caution and employed mainly to inform shortterm decisions. In fact, pandemic forecasting has raised many doubts in the last year due to several issues that can affect its accuracy and reliability, including, for example, (i) high interval predictions and sensitivity of the estimates, especially with long-term forecasts; (ii) inaccurate modeling assumptions, and (iii) the lack of or difficulty in measuring and identifying biological features of COVID-19 transmission [30, 42] . These limitations-and the possibility for misleading forecasts-may erode public trust in science and thus affect compliance with policies intended to mitigate the Fig. 9 Comparison between forecasts and real data during the period October 14, 2020, to November 12, 2020, for patients hospitalized with mild symptoms (six best models) spread of COVID-19 [49] . Indeed, the inevitable uncertainty associated with this novel disease and the general failure of long-term and even mid-term forecasts require a different scientific approach toward model predictions. More prudent and balanced communication with the public is crucial if the field of science desires to maintain its leading role in human development and policymaking.",

In fact, consistent with real-time data, the models predicted that the number of patients hospitalized with mild symptoms and admitted to the ICU would grow significantly until mid-November 2020. According to the estimations, the necessary ordinary and intensive care beds were expected to double in 10 days and to triple in approximately 20 days.

Combining hybrid models with mechanistic mathematical models may partially overcome these issues by considering the effects of lockdowns on epidemiological parameters [68] . Thus, future research could proceed along these lines. Ultimately, since other factors may have affected COVID-19 dynamics, especially as the pandemic progressed, these predictions should be treated with caution and utilized only to inform short-term decision-making processes.
