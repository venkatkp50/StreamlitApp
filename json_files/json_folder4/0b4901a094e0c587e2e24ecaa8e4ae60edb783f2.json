These issues however are not new. Delays in time from the first dose in a high-income country to introduction at scale in a low-income country can take years. These delays are driven by several challenges, some of which are unique to the vaccine development ecosystem. The patenting and overall intellectual property (IP) protection are complex, regulatory oversight is rigorous, manufacturing processes require technical support or know-how transfer from the innovator, and market dynamics create obstacles to delivering at scale. However, there are opportunities to accelerate the introduction of vaccines at scale in low and middle-income countries. To identify those opportunities, this paper provides an overview of the vaccine research and development process and where reform of the current system could increase access [1] .",

As a result, MNCs' development pipelines are more and more being replenished from external sources through in-licensing and occasionally through mergers and acquisitions [5] . Another trend is the increasing success of DCVMNs to rapidly develop complex second-generation vaccines without formal technology transfer (i.e. pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV), hexavalent, and human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV).

The scientific challenges of developing vaccines for these diseases are formidable, which is reflected in the fact that few new products have been brought to market over the last two decades. For example, it took 30 years for GSK to develop its Mosquirix vaccine due to the complex biological nature of the malaria parasite [10] .

Practically, manufacturers agree to sell large volumes of vaccines to eligible lower-income countries for a price significantly lower than for middle-income and higher-income countries [23] . For example, for Gavi-eligible countries in WHO's Africa region, the price for HPV vaccines from GSK in 2018 was on average USD37m versus USD114m for non-Gavi countries [17] . While countries that have never been eligible for Gavi support do not have access to these lower tiers of pricing, countries that are transitioning from Gavi support are granted access to continued concessional pricing for a period of time to avoid sudden budgetary impacts from assuming responsibility for vaccine procurement [25] . This policy was adopted after some criticism that countries would face \"price walls\" as increases in the per capita income moved them out of eligibility for Gavi support. Gavi, together with UNICEF, the Gates Foundation, and others also prepares supply and procurement roadmaps [25] for each vaccine in the Gavi portfolio, which identifies actions required to sustain or increase affordability.",

These technologies, if confirmed successful mid-to-long-term, could represent a significant potential for new vaccines made faster at lower production costs. As such, the recent roll-out by BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna of their mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 is a landmark. While DNA vaccines have not shown the same progress, there has been positive development (i.e. Inovio) [40] . Given the engagement of many public funders in this field, access agreements upfront in the R&D process, including around management of IP and know-how, transfer of technology and pricing considerations, will be particularly important to monitor. The IP landscape for these vaccines have already proven to be highly fragmented [41] , and given the nascency of the technology, developers might take a restrictive approach to participating in technology transfer or granting IP access.",

Associated scale-up involving experiment-based adjustments are therefore not available to or discoverable by new players in the field. Further, production facilities must be dedicated or reconfigured for other biological entities. Manufacturers also need to develop and implement lot-testing procedures that include the analysis of potency, stability and purity that can delay timelines. Together, this complex range of production steps is often referred to as \"know-how\".

Despite these efforts, there have been few agreements for technology transfer for second-generation vaccines [2] . The potential of technology transfer to reduce costs and time to market in low-income countries as well as increase volumes and overall access remains largely untapped and this could be a key area for future reform and one where a neutral organization could consider a role in brokering partnerships and advising on deal structures. With support from donor and philanthropic organizations like PATH, DCVMN related vaccine manufacturers are increasingly developing in-house technical skills and know-how which over time may help address this issue. This is an area that could benefit from further investment, as could facilitation of discussions and agreements (e.g. IPR, technology transfer) between targeted DCVMN manufacturers that do not have access to other regional markets and potential DCVMN players in those regions.",

If targeting low and middle-income countries, a WHO Prequalification is required. This can take up to 12 months [43] . Batch release also requires NRA approval, and NRA must periodically inspect the manufacturing facilities for \"Good Manufacturing Practices\" (GMP), and QA/QC. Both of these require that the NRA have adequate competencies and resources for product assessment.

Since new entrants are forced to undergo many of the same upfront investments, the large initial fixed costs may make it difficult for them to compete on price unless tech-transfer partnerships are entered into. As a way to address this, the BMGF and governments have provided so-called up-front \"push funding\" and incentives for many DCVMN companies working on second-generation vaccines for low-income countries to offset fixed and development costs (e.g., pneumococcal, pentavalent, rotavirus).

There are two major groupings of vaccine manufacturers. MNCs are for the most part organized under the \"International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations\" (IFPMA), a trade group that represents companies involved in both therapeutic drugs and vaccines. Vaccine manufacturers from developing countries for the most part belong to the \"Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers Network\" (DCVMN).

For example, a study done in 2012 by the World Intellectual Property Organization [45] found that 11,800 patent families had been filed between 1921-2011 for active constituents of prophylactic vaccines against infectious diseases. Among these 516 patent families related to flu vaccines, 165 patent families related to pneumococcal conjugated vaccines, and 36 patent families related to typhoid conjugated vaccines. Patents include technologies required for manufacturing (cell cultures, nucleic acid sequences, viral vector technology, virus/cell bank technologies, egg-based virus replication, etc.), active ingredients (antigens, adjuvants), production technologies, and processes (e.g., filtration, purification, conjugation, freeze-drying, etc.). The safeguarding of know-how and patenting of smaller components of the vaccine development process can be important to vaccine manufacturers as it extends protection in time far beyond the initial patent for active ingredients. However, when such patenting does not reflect substantial technological advancements, it may lead to unreasonably long patent protection. Such an unjustified extension of the exclusivity period can impede price competition and follow-up innovation,",
