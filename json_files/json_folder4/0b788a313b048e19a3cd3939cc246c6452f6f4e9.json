Main themes identified include (1) work setting, (2) perceptions of COVID-19, (3) employee wellbeing, (4) organizational strategies, and (5) influences on career behaviors. Employees have faced challenges due to work conditions that have shifted from traditional commuting to telework. Employees have also become aware of the negative current situation, so their overall wellbeing has been threatened. In response, organizations have strived to promote positive psychological capital for employees as they attempt to cope with this crisis. Organizations have tried to maintain and manage both their employees and their business. People tended to adjust their career-related behaviors based on how they perceived their own wellbeing and organizational strategies.",

Critical organizational concerns surrounding employee support have also been compounded by new guidelines for workers, for example, as many work experiences have changed (Chen and Eyoun, 2021) . In addition, there has been growing interest in efficient telework systems, as employees and organizations have had to adjust to virtual and mobile work systems (Rai\u0161ien\u0117 et al., 2020; Bartsch et al., 2021) . To address these challenges, many studies have offered suggestions to provide support for employees and their organizations (Aguinis and Burgi-Tian, 2021; Kuknor and Bhattacharya, 2021) .",

Considering the proliferation of relevant studies related to COVID-19 in the past 2 years, it is time to review and detect the overall trends and focus of these studies. In particular, it is important to summarize how employees suffered from psychological and behavioral challenges and how organizations addressed various problems. Examining these studies will uncover lessons learned and provide direction for future studies. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to synthesize the main topics on employees and organizations discussed in recent academic studies related to the COVID-19 pandemic using a systematic literature review. The findings can provide insights to help prepare for future challenges and highlight needed interventions at the employee and organizational levels.",

We collected 280 articles using the standards in the search field of All subjects & indexing (SU) and full-text, peer-reviewed scholarly journals written in English after 2020, which corresponds to the pandemic period. Although these articles were searched based on the search criteria, we excluded 95 articles in the second stage because the search terms were not included in our target field. For example, Cotterill et al. (2020) was initially browsed when searched with our search criteria. However, although the term employee was included in other fields, it was not in the subject field. Next, we filtered 46 non-research articles such as editorials and commentaries in the third stage. Following the fourth stage, we removed 78 papers whose abstracts did not contain any discussion related to COVID-19. For example, the abstract of Bhandari et al. (2020) mentioned only about health workers' core competencies that were not directly connected with COVID-19, so the article was excluded. Finally, we read the full text of each article and excluded 16 articles that used data prior to COVID-19 and were not specifically related to our topic. For example, Palumbo's (2020) study was excluded because the data were collected in 2015. As a result of this process, 45 articles remained for the review based on the collected data.",

According to Sethi and Saini (2020) , schoolteachers who worked from home perceived their jobs positively even though they faced moderate challenges. In another study, flexible working hours were perceived as a benefit of working from home and an increased focus on work was also reported (Diab-Bahman and Al-Enzi, 2020). In contrast, in a study on women who worked from home in India (Bhattacharjee, 2020) , the participants reported that working from home had some disadvantages, such as difficulty transitioning between their domestic role and working role, and the added burden of chores.",

In the Iometrics and Iometrics Global Workplace Analytics (2020), 88% of respondents were working from home regularly during the pandemic.

These findings indicate that the existing drawbacks have not been overcome although discussion about continuing telework has persisted. Moreover, ineffectiveness of the traditional telework system in managing work and necessity for novel approach of telework was reported (Golden, 2009 ), but the pandemic brought more challenges for telework in work management. In particular, organizations that were faced with a sudden transition to telework during COVID-19 often lacked adequate preparation for a proper response to implement and manage telework, so managing employees' work may have been even more inefficient.",

Savolainen et al. (2021) designed a longitudinal survey to determine the characteristics of predictors that induced anxiety from COVID-19 for Finnish workers. The results showed that psychological factors, such as perceived loneliness, psychological distress, and technostress, were the most significant factors leading to employees' perceptions of anxiety related to COVID-19 (Savolainen et al., 2021) . Negative feelings and stress usually came from hardships in adapting to new work settings and social isolation. Similarly, Toscano and Zappal\u00e0 (2020) revealed that social isolation raised employees' stress and harmed their productivity in a remote work setting. These findings support previous studies showing that the lack of social interaction is a main reason for employees' greater fear and stress (Weinert et al., 2015) .",

Liu et al. (2021) confirmed this negative correlation between the perceived impact of COVID-19 and frontline health workers' work engagement. Frontline nurses working in a community setting also reported the strong influence of COVID-19 fear on their job satisfaction and turnover intention (De los Santos and Labrague, 2021) . Given that frontline workers played a crucial role during the pandemic, workers in frontline settings have demanded that they be allowed to manage their negative outlook on the present situation. Many scholars examined protective factors that could soothe the adverse impact of COVID-19 perceptions on employees' job behavior and consciousness. Hu et al. (2020) and Liu et al. (2021) similarly elucidated that fear of mortality could be mitigated when individuals realized the meaning of a job and their usefulness as members of an organization. Trougakos et al.

Similar to the SARS and swine flu pandemics, a large number of healthcare workers experienced fear, anxiety, and frustration during the COVID-19 pandemic, so they had difficulties continuing their jobs (Hall et al., 2003; Ives et al., 2009; De los Santos and Labrague, 2021; Liu et al., 2021) . However, workers' job behaviors and attitudes can vary depending on whether they perceive that their current working environment is a personal threat. For example, Ives et al. (2009) reported that some workers believe that abandoning work would not always guarantee that they could protect themselves or their family's safety in disastrous situations. In fact, most nurses had to regularly manage their negative emotions related to disease-induced anxiety and they found it difficult to work efficiently, which diminished their wellbeing (Hall et al., 2003) . Studies on natural disasters like earthquakes have reported similar conclusions about the relationship between disaster-related perceptions and employees' job engagement .",

They noted that interpersonal trust is a social bond between colleagues and managers, and job satisfaction is part of employee wellbeing and positive mental health (Rose et al., 2017;  Buli\u0144ska-Stangrecka and Bagie\u0144ska, 2021).

They also proposed alternatives to overcome these constraints, such as choosing proper communication strategies and creating elaborate communication protocols. Leaders were urged to be more accommodative to employees' preferred ways of communication to address their struggles and help them adapt to the virtual environments (Bekirogullari and Thambusamy, 2020) .",

(2021) surveyed Thai employees in various corporate environments and found that organizational norms surrounding remote work played a significant role in helping employees increase productivity and organizational commitment. Gan (2020) found that nursing personnel benefitted from telework during the pandemic because telework made it possible for them to work during flexible hours. The extension of baby boomer nurses' work (i.e., past retirement age) was also advantageous for both younger bedtime nurses with less experience and hospitals to compensate for the shortage of nurses during the pandemic (Gan, 2020) . In terms of adopting appropriate strategies, Jankelov\u00e1 et al. (2021) recommended that managers need proper crisis management abilities, including effective decision-making and cooperative communication skills that encourage teamwork. In particular, they confirmed the mediating effect of sharing information, teamwork, and cognitive diversity, and asserted that abundant information and directions helped employees feel safer and raised their productivity during the pandemic.",

Thus, they suggested that managers should redefine employees' tasks and job procedures and allow the organization to adapt to the environmental changes. Buhusayen et al. (2020) also emphasized that frontline managers should be involved in the management planning stage and share information about implementing turnaround management strategies. Akingbola (2020) explored the impact of COVID-19 on non-profit employees and the need for management strategies such as scenario planning that reflects employees' voices and challenges. However, layoffs, as an organizational strategy during COVID-19, limited their human resources strategy choices when there was no government support to keep them afloat (Dwomoh et al., 2020) . Particularly small companies were not prepared to manage work when they faced severe COVID-related situations and struggles (Sharma, 2020) .",

It explains that the intensity of an event reflects the novelty, disruption, and criticality, and the more these characteristics are present, the more likely they will affect behaviors (Morgeson et al., 2015) . Thus, changing the work environment could affect employees' perceptions of telework and employees' behaviors differently depending on how novel, disruptive, and critical employees perceive their own context. When applying this theory to changes in new work settings due to COVID-19, the degree of novelty is different depending on the previous experience of working from home. For example, employees in knowledge-intensive industries were more likely to use telework before the pandemic compared to workers in other fields (Abulibdeh, 2020) . In addition, there was a difference in workers' level of disruption depending on whether they could continue their work normally. Some employees did not experience much disruption, but rather were more productive due to flexible working hours (Diab-Bahman and Al-Enzi, 2020; Sethi and Saini, 2020) . However, Bolisani et al. (2020) reported that the respondents did not always think it was positive because they were unprepared for the distracting environment and autonomy working from home and lacked physical equipment. Lastly, the criticality of telework reflected how employees perceived telework as having a long-term impact. Some employees might believe that it is best to continue telework because the pandemic is continuing and the importance of telework will expand after the COVID-19 pandemic (Abulibdeh, 2020) . Consequently, even if they face a similar event, employees will have different levels of challenges and event strength and different perspectives on how they will accept a new or ongoing crisis.",

Emotions are systematically produced by transactions between the individual and the environment, which are mediated by the individual's cognitive appraisal and coping process (Folkman, 2008) . Cognitive appraisal relates to an evaluation process of circumstances and the environment of individuals based on their wellbeing. This assessment determines how individuals cope with and feel about demands placed on them. According to this transactional theoretical framework, employees evaluated the current crisis as a threat, and they had negative perceptions of COVID-19 such as anxiety and fear because the COVID-19 crisis brought sudden unique changes in their working environment that became stressful demands for employees. Coping represents adaptational outcomes when a person forms a perception of an event (Lazarus and Folkman, 1987) . Coping strategies can vary based on how individuals view stressful circumstances as harm, threat or challenge (Goh et al., 2010) . Most of the articles under the Perceptions of COVID-19 category indicated that COVID-induced negative emotions lowered employees' engagement. However, one study (De Clercq and Pereira, 2021) argued that these pessimistic responses can sometimes encourage employees to improve their productivity and creativity. Once employees appraise the current crisis as a helpful challenge for themselves, they are willing to adopt coping actions that enhance their engagement.",

The theory explains that people tend to protect and build resources perceived as valuable including objects and energy (Hobfoll et al., 2018) , and the amount of retained resources is important (Chong et al., 2020) . People consider change and transition to be stressful in that they can cause fluctuations in resources (Hobfoll et al., 2018) . During the COVID-19 pandemic, everything abruptly changed from people's lifestyles to work settings, and even employees' safety was not guaranteed. Therefore, loss of resources for adaptation and stability was unavoidable. Working during the pandemic placed enormous demands on employees by continuously depleting resources and reducing employee wellbeing. People who lack resources are far more vulnerable to the continuous loss of resources when they work in stressful jobs for a long time or they do not have enough time to replenish surplus resources (Halbesleben et al., 2014) . Especially, frontline workers should spend much more energy, and even draw their sense of vocational duty. As a result, they experienced resource deterioration (Meseguer de Pedro et al., 2021) , felt despair and helplessness, which led to self-defeating consequences such as burnout (Dinibutun, 2020) . Moreover, when organizations do not provide enough resources, employees cannot enhance their work productivity (Vaziri et al., 2020) . A mismatch between employees' needs and organizations' support can also contribute to severely lower employee wellbeing (Mostafa, 2016) . Social support can also be explained by resource investment and recovery mechanisms (Halbesleben et al., 2014) . Spending time and energy to socially support colleagues means a loss of resources for employees in the short-term, but this investment can be returned in various forms from colleagues in the longterm. Thus, in a crisis when employees cannot avoid resource deterioration, strengthening interdependence and increasing communication to share difficulties with their co-workers can help protect employees' wellbeing.",

            "text": "The job demands-resources (JD-R) theory explains why organizational strategies as a job resource support employees suffering from job demands (Bakker and Demerouti, 2007) . Job resources such as the organization at large or social relations can lead to high organizational outcomes by acting as the motivation and can buffer the effect of job demands on strain such as jobrelated anxiety or health complaints (Bakker and Demerouti, 2007) . Two articles in our review on leadership strategies argued that leaders should support employees both emotionally and interpersonally (Bekirogullari and Thambusamy, 2020; Dirani et al., 2020) . In line with the JD-R model, leaders can positively influence employees by offering social support (Bakker and Demerouti, 2017) , and communication with colleagues is especially critical. In addition, organizational norms and adequate guidelines help employees by increasing role clarity and task identity, which can be job resources. For similar reasons, sufficient information and participation in decision making can also help employees be more productive. In contrast, isolation (Toscano and Zappal\u00e0, 2020) , technostress (Bekirogullari and Thambusamy, 2020) and organizational changes were aspects of job demands during the pandemic and consequently led to low work engagement or low productivity. Therefore, it is important that employees clearly understand their organizations' strategies. In particular, human resources involvement worked as a job resource during the pandemic , and has been shown to reduce the impact of job demands on strain (Bakker and Demerouti, 2007) . Thus, organizations should try to reduce the job demands and determine how to encourage their employees. Lent et al. (1994) suggested that career-related choices and actions are created through the dynamic interplay between one's self-efficacy, job interests, and outcome expectations based on social cognitive career theory. Two studies reported that employees decided to change their career behaviors (e.g., to be absent, to leave the countries where they were working) because they anticipated negative outcomes if they continued working in the current conditions (Gregori, 2020; Hoang, 2020) . Without safety measures and social support from governments and organizations, employees cannot engage well in their job tasks and thus may decide to change their job. Dos Santos (2020) found that most nursing students considered financial concerns as the most important reason for leaving their career paths. According to Brown and Lent (2017) , self-efficacy and outcome expectations affect career-related actions far more when career interests are deeply interrelated with economic motivations. Consequently, the choice to keep studying for a nursing career intensely relied on whether students perceived that they could earn much money by enduring the vulnerable working environment or not. Self-efficacy and outcome expectations are an individual's cognitive process, which interacts with his or her surrounding environment. The articles related to self-efficacy were all relevant to how employees perceived their surrounding circumstances including financial rewards (Dos Santos, 2020), organizational or governmental support (Gregori, 2020; Hoang, 2020) , and employees' own safety (Gregori, 2020) . They also discussed how employees could adapt in the changing pandemic setting by reorganizing their career choices and goals. These findings illustrate that employees consider not only their future career expectations, but also whether they can endure and persist to work in risky situations.",

At the employee level, considering new forms of work are emerging due to technological developments and social changes, employees should endeavor to build and maintain capabilities to create a productive environment where they can work. Employees should also create their own independent spaces by establishing physical boundaries between their home and workspaces. In terms of employees' behavioral readiness, employees need to engage in appropriate crisis-coping behaviors since it helps employees believe that they can have some level of control over the circumstances with effective, problem-focused actions (Trougakos et al., 2020) . In terms of psychological readiness, resilience and optimism can serve as protective factors to help employees withstand difficult circumstances. Creating an environment with low conflict and high enrichment in the workplace can help overcome these challenges. It would also be helpful to pay attention to the relationships with managers and colleagues by sharing emotions and encouraging each other. Therefore, adequate interactions with others should be learned and encouraged. Further, from individual efforts to readiness, employees need to know that organizations are making efforts to provide strategies to help them and utilize their external support.",

Examples include work rearrangements, financial aid to purchase digital devices, and telecommunication systems. Moreover, organizations should establish strategies that reflect employees' psychological states and challenges and help employees resolve the problems they face. Organizational concerns can positively influence employees' mental health, and individuals are less likely to experience emotional difficulty when they think they will receive enough support from organizations. Therefore, various programs can be designed based on the difficulties associated with employee wellbeing in crisis situations, including support for mental health. In addition, organizations must communicate about their strategies to support employees. Last, additional organizational efforts to create an effective organizational culture with social support among employees should be highlighted. A leader's capability to respond to a crisis, provide social support, and display servant leadership can help employees perceive that employers care about them, and this perception can relieve their stress level. Therefore, the roles of managers and organizational strategies in providing social support to create a positive organizational climate and wellbeing are important to address both employees' wellbeing and organizational productivity in this crisis.",

COVID-19 is a new and different challenge causing suffering for companies and employees around the world. The organizations have incorporated environmental changes and have begun to develop workable strategies. These changes have meant transitioning to a new norm, but the findings also highlight the importance of employees' psychological capital, making them resilient and helping them manage difficult situations. Thus, there is a need for organizations to build multi-dimensional strategies and a favorable organizational culture to address employees' psychological responses to crises.

Additionally, future studies can be tuned to deeply uncover the various impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on diverse social groups by gender, race, and age. Some scholars have already reported interesting findings. Duncan (2020), Kirkman (2020) , and Stevens (2020) have provided empirical evidence of gender differences in behavioral and psychological difficulties during the pandemic. Considering the importance of this topic from a perspective of inclusive management, more in-depth investigation is needed through both quantitative and qualitative data. Finally, to determine the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals and organizations, longitudinal studies should be conducted.",
