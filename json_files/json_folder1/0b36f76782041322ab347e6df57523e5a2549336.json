Cavity alteration has been shown to affect protein stability [14-142 16]. Hence, it is likely that this variant is deleterious to the virus.

Despite no structural damage found from p.K278T, the 146 extra h-bond formed between the main chain of Thr278 and the side chain of Thr286 was due to the 147 side chain repacking of Thr286 rather than the mutation from Lys278 to Thr278. Nevertheless, the fact 148 that all of the six Thailand-specific variants were rare (found in < 1% of the samples collected) could 149 imply that they are unlikely to enhance the virus's transmissibility. We next examined additional 150 variants identified in Thailand (the full structural analysis of the 52 spike variants found in Thailand is 151 provided in Supplementary Table 1) South East Asian countries [32, 33] . The higher transmissibility of p.D614G can also explain the higher outbreak. No clear structural damage was identified by our analysis. Variant p.S459F was predicted to 165 disrupt an H-bond formed within surface residues (an H-bond linking Arg457 and Ser459 was disrupted 166 when the variant was simulated on PDB 6XR8, while a disruption of an H-bond formed between two 167 consecutive residues Ser459 and Asn460 was detected when tested on PDB 4M0J), which is likely to 168 be compensated by the interaction with nearby water molecules and therefore not structurally 169 destabilising. Variant p.L5F was a newly emerging variant in the second Thai outbreak. It is located 170 near the N-terminal of the spike protein. Unfortunately, this residue was not covered by the available 171 3D coordinates and no structural analysis could be performed. Variant p.S939F was not predicted to 172 affect the structure of the spike trimer or its interaction with ACE2. Accordingly, a previous study 173 suggested that this variant is not likely to enhance SARS-CoV-2 infectivity [34] . is a critical residue for spike-hACE2, and its substitution to tyrosine is a variant of concern. However, 191 our analysis did not suggest that the asparagine to threonine substitution may cause any major structural Interestingly, despite analysing nearly 500,000 sequences, some residues in the SARS-CoV-2 195 spike protein did not contain any variant. Many of these highly conserved residues are clustered in the 196 receptor-binding domain, which binds to the human ACE2 and triggers host cell invasion [12, 13, 35] , 197 and the Coronavirus S2 domain, which mediates viral cell membrane fusion [41] . The lack of variants 198 in these regions may suggest biological importance of those particular residues on protein folding and/or 199 interaction. As genetic variations are usually maintained by natural selection, any alteration on these 200 highly conserved residues could be deleterious to the survival of the virus. Conserved domains and 201 residues could therefore serve as biomarkers [42] or promising drug targets against SARS-CoV-2 [41, 202 43] . 203",

This 152 variant was predicted to cause the loss of inter-chains H-bonds between aspartic acid 614 and lysines 153 835 and 854 in the spike trimer, which could affect the spike trimer packing. A study by Yurkovetskiy 154 et al. using cryo-electron microscopy, indeed, confirms that p.D614G disrupts an interprotomer contact, 155 thus facilitating the spike \"open conformation\" [16, 30]. This variant is estimated to increase the 156 transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 by 20% [31], thus explaining why, although identified in few samples 157 in March 2020 (first Thai outbreak) before a strict lockdown measure was enforced, it had become the 158 dominant strain by February 2021 (second Thai outbreak), similarly to what was observed in other 159",

Asparagine 501 is a critical residue involved in the stabilization of lysine 353, one of 176 the two critical lysines involved in spike-hACE2 interaction[35]. Indeed, asparagine 501 harbors the 177 variant of concern p.N501Y, which has been proposed to enhance spike-hACE2 affinity through the 178 introduction of new hydrogen bonds between tyrosine 501 on the spike protein and residues on the 179 hACE2 [17, 36, 37]. We analysed the structural consequences of p.N501T and did not observe major 180 structural changes. Indeed, an in vitro study showed this variant may cause a reduction in spike-hACE2 during the two major SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. Our phylogenetic analysis shows how the variant of 185 global concern p.D614G already present in March 2020 became the dominant strain during the second 186Thai outbreak in late December 2020 -February 2021. This variant was detected in the majority of the 187 strains collected from the seafood market [38, 39]. Found predominantly in Europe, this spike protein 188 variant has been shown to have a higher transmissibility rate compared to the original Wuhan strain 189 [31, 40].
