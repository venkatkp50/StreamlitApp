In January, 2020 the DH Project ECHO team began planning a series on chronic pain with providers from CP&S, palliative care, primary care, and population health. The series was deferred in favor of time-sensitive COVID-19 ECHO courses; however, with growing awareness of pain care challenges during COVID-19(8), the 10-session series \"Effective Care of Chronic Pain Made Simpler\" launched in September, 2020, ending in mid-January, 2021. Structure and content The targeted audience included clinicians of any discipline treating persons with pain. Fiftyseven registrants mostly from rural, under-resourced regions of northern New England included 22 MD/DOs, 12 ARNP/PAs, 7 MSW/MAs, 5 RN/LPNs, 2 PT/OTs and 9 others. The DH ECHO panel included members of the CP&S (interventionist, psychologist, APRN, physical therapist) as well as palliative care, primary care and addiction medicine clinicians, many of whom had not previously worked together.The 10 session didactics presented different principles and tools for chronic pain management rather than focusing on management of different pain types. Topics included: Biopsychosocial",
