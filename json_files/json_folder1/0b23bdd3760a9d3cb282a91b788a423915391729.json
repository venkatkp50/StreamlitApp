On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the outbreak was a public health emergency of international concern and thereafter recognized it as a pandemic [2, 3] . As of June 20, 2020, more than eight million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 187 countries and territories. More than 450,000 deaths have been associated with this infection [4] . Taiwan is a close neighbor of PRC and reported its first COVID-19 case on January 21, 2020 [5] . As of June 20, 2020, there were 446 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Taiwan. As a result of the early implementation of social distancing, hand hygiene, and face masks, Taiwan has had a low incidence of domestic COVID-19 cases [6] .",

An in vitro study showed that chloroquine is effective against SARS-CoV-2 at the entry and post-entry infection stages [8] . Chloroquine may either increase endosomal pH by blocking the fusion of the virus and the host cell membrane [18] or by interfering with cell receptor glycosylation [19] . Chloroquine may also repress proinflammatory signaling and cytokine (IL-1, IL-6, and TNF) production by inhibiting lysosome activity in antigen-presenting cells [20] . Compared to chloroquine, HCQ has an additional hydroxyl group, lower toxicity, and similar antiviral efficacy. HCQ received emergency approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the treatment of COVID-19 [21] . However, the efficacy of HCQ against SARS-CoV-2 has been highly controversial. Certain elite journals have retracted influential papers published on the efficacy of HCQ against COVID-19 [22, 23] . HCQ is widely available in Taiwan and has become a potential candidate drug therapy against COVID-19 there. Therefore, an openlabel randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving multiple centers was conducted to evaluate HCQ efficacy and tolerability in adult patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. These results would be compared with the standard of care treatment (SOC) in Taiwan. In addition, a retrospective observational study was also performed.",

Gautret et al. treated 20 patients with 200 mg HCQ thrice daily for 10 days. Six of these patients were administered concomitant azithromycin and 16 other patients received no HCQ therapy. The efficacy of HCQ at clearing the virus was remarkable: 70.0% by day 6 post-inclusion in treated patients vs. 12.5% at day 6 post-inclusion in untreated patients (p < 0.001). However, six of the patients being administered HCQ became clinically worse or were lost to follow-up. Consequently, they were excluded from the final analysis and interpretation of the data became very difficult. Hence, the same team performed an uncontrolled non-comparative observational study on a cohort comprising 80 patients presenting with mild COVID-19 symptoms who underwent HCQ and azithromycin treatment [28] . Subsequently, rapid declines in nasopharyngeal viral load were reported (83% and 93% of the treated patients at days 7 and 8, respectively). A large-scale observational study was conducted on 1,376 COVID-19 patients in New York [29] of whom 58.9% were administered HCQ 600 mg twice on day 1 and 400 mg daily thereafter for a median of 5 days. However, HCQ administration was not associated with the composite intubation or death endpoint (hazard ratio = 1.04; 95% CI = 0.82, 1.32). Another large-scale observational study, conducted on 2,541 COVID-19 patients in southeast Michigan [30] , demonstrated that HCQ administration provides a 66% hazard ratio reduction in in-hospital mortality compared with no HCQ treatment (p < 0.001).",

In Tang's study, 98.6% (148/150) of the enrolled subjects were categorized as presenting with mild to moderate illness but 63% of the enrollees had also been treated with antiviral agents (arbidol, ribavirin, lopinavir/ritonavir, oseltamivir, or entecavir) which may have interfered with HCQ efficacy.",

Furthermore, the HCQ treatment regimen used here consisted of loading twice with 400 mg followed by 200 mg twice daily for 7 days [34] . A physiologically based pharmacokinetic model indicated that the aforementioned dose used in the present study was ideal for HCQ therapy [35] . Third, no antiviral therapy was administered and only one case in the HCQ group and two cases in the SOC group had azithromycin treatment.",

            "text": "In contrast, there were limitations to the present study. Only patients presenting with mild to moderate disease symptoms were enrolled to determine the viral clearance efficacy of HCQ. Hence, there is relatively little data on the impact of severe disease in terms of intubation and mortality. At clinical trial launch, there were no indigenous and very few imported cases in Taiwan. Therefore, study enrollment was prematurely stopped. The low case numbers in the present study might account for the apparent lack of superior efficacy of HCQ, and only reflects the effects of HCQ in young COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms. However, 81% of the HCQ group and 75% of the SOC group had confirmed viral clearance on hospital day 14. Moreover, according to Taiwan CDC regulations, subjects could not leave quarantine until they presented with at least three consecutive negative rRT-PCR results. The outcome of this RCT may assist the Taiwan CDC in its decision to release quarantined patients when medical resources are in short supply. Another limitation of the study was that the mean patient age (SD) was 32.9 (10.7) y as opposed to 51. [15, 27, [30] [31] [32] . For this reason, the observed rates of cardiac and retinal toxicity were low in the present study. Electrocardiogram monitoring was performed frequently and close attention was paid to any changes in patient QTc interval, vision, and neurological symptoms. Lastly, readers might question the gap in median time to negative viral detection between the retrospective observational study and RCT. As the time from infection to admission, and the time from diagnosis to treatment were diverse, and the frequency of viral sampling was not the same in the retrospective observational cohort, the different outcome compared with the present RCT was not surprising.",
