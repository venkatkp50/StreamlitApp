The standard analyses used for their detection have significant limitations regarding cost, special facilities and equipment, highly trained staff, and a long procedural time that can be crucial for foodborne pathogens with high hospitalization and mortality rates, such as Listeria monocytogenes. This study aimed to develop a biosensor that could detect L. monocytogenes rapidly and robustly. For this purpose, a cell-based biosensor technology based on the Bioelectric Recognition Assay (BERA) and a portable device developed by EMBIO Diagnostics, called B.EL.D (Bio Electric Diagnostics), were used. Membrane engineering was performed by electroinsertion of Listeria monocytogenes homologous antibodies into the membrane of African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells. The newly developed biosensor was able to detect the pathogen's presence rapidly (3 min) at concentrations as low as 10 2 CFU mL \u22121 , demonstrating a higher sensitivity than most existing biosensor-based methods. In addition, lack of cross-reactivity with other Listeria species, as well as with Escherichia coli, was shown, thus, indicating biosensor's significant specificity against L. monocytogenes.",

Bacteria, viruses, parasites, and chemicals that contaminate food at any stage of food production are the causative agents for these infections. It is estimated that 600 million people (i.e., 10% of the global population) get sick and 420,000 people die every year due to the consumption of contaminated food [1] . Listeria monocytogenes is an intracellular pathogenic bacterium widely distributed in the environment that has been determined as a causative agent of serious epidemic and sporadic food-borne illnesses in humans. Listeriosis can lead to gastroenteritis, meningitis, or other severe symptoms with high hospitalization and mortality rates (20-30%), especially in vulnerable populations. In 2016, listeriosis was the most severe illness with the highest hospitalization and mortality rate in Europe. In the meantime, it is estimated that 1600 people get listeriosis and about 260 people die each year in the USA [2] .",

Hence, food safety authorities have made pathogen detection a priority. Currently, the detection of L. monocytogenes in food is mainly performed following the ISO 11290-1:2017 [3] . This culture method is based on the pathogen's physical and chemical characteristics and is a gold standard method, however, it is also time-consuming since it requires four days to provide the first indications for either presumptive presence or absence of the pathogen and five to seven days to undoubtedly confirm the pathogen's presence. Furthermore, DNA analysis based on quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) or microarray methods have been developed. Even though these methods are precise, they have significant limitations regarding cost, special facilities, long procedural time, and highly trained staff requirements [4] . Rapid detection methods based on molecular techniques (e.g., real-time qPCR) and immunology-based methods (e.g., VIDAS (Vitek Immuno Diagnostic Assay System) for L. monocytogenes) have also been developed. However, molecular techniques are still restricted by high-cost equipment and reagents, as well as complicated nucleic acid extraction procedures, while immunology-based methods are restricted by lower detection sensitivity [5] . Developing rapid, low-cost methods with high sensitivity and specificity to detect bacteria in food and reduce the risk to public health remains a challenge.",

The innovation of these biosensors is that, unlike other types of biosensors containing only living-extracted elements, they use live cells as receptors. This type of biosensor consists of the following: (a) living cells, the biological identification element, that acts as the primary signal transducer element and is used as the primary element for the collection and transmission of signals, and (b) the secondary transducer element that converts these responses in electrical signals. When cells interact with a stimulus, they produce changes in molecules or ions, changes in potential, or changes in impedance due to cell metabolism, etc. A secondary transducer element can detect these responses and convert them into electrical signals [12] . Cell-based biosensors have the advantages of increased stability and high biocatalytic activity, and their main feature is their ability to provide relevant cellular information in response to the sample and finally measure its activity. Furthermore, their robustness, high selectivity, specificity, and evolvability have raised cell-based biosensors as a significant revolution in analytical science [13] . However, only a few studies have been performed on L. monocytogenes detection using cell-based biosensors [14] [15] [16] .",

The BERA method is based on the insertion, by electroporation, of a large number of receptor molecules (antibodies, enzymes, etc.) on the cell membrane, increasing their selectivity for recognizing target analytes [23, 24] . The methodology is based on measuring the change in membrane potential caused by the binding of the target molecule to the receptors previously inserted into the cell membrane. In the beginning, the cell membrane potential is stable due to the ions flowing through the ion channels. Subsequently, and after the target molecule binds to the receptor, its structure changes, resulting in its molecular charge being displaced within the cell membrane. As a result, a large number of ions concentrate on one side of the membrane. Opening the ion channel creates an ionic current that can be measured as a corresponding current.",

EMBIO's device in combination with the bioelectric recognition assay (BERA), an established cell-based biosensor technology, has created a biosensor system that allows high throughput screening and rapid testing. Furthermore, the system connects via Bluetooth 4.0 with a smartphone or tablet, allowing the end-user to be instantly informed of each analysis result ( Figure 1B) . The system has been previously reported by Apostolou et al. [26] . The screen-printed electrodes were purchased from Zimmer and Peacock (Horten, Norway). Each single gold electrode was comprised of a 625 \u00b5m thick ceramic substrate (alumina) with three screen-printed electrodes (working electrode, reference electrode, and counter electrode). The working electrode was made of gold, and the reference electrode was made of silver/silver chloride. The counter electrode was canceled out by the measuring system ( Figure 1C ).",

Each measurement consisted of the data obtained by the 8 screen-printed electrodes that recorded the cell response as a time series of potentiometric measurements (in Volts) and comprised 360 values per electrode (sampling rate of 2 Hz). The detected measurements were visualized through a voltage/time graph ( Figure 1D ). b. Training/Testing Dataset: The obtained dataset was split into training and testing dataset as follows: 30% was used for training (60 measurements) and 70% was used for testing (140 measurements). The training dataset was utilized to determine the algorithm thresholds and the testing dataset was utilized for the algorithm evaluation. c. Processing/Feature Extraction: The processing of the dataset was performed in a two-step procedure. In the first step, peaks were determined and starting noise was cleaned to smooth and calibrate the signal before the first peak. Then, all values were shifted to start at y = 0 and from each experimental dataset values from 120 to 200 were shifted at x = 0 and kept for further analysis ( Figure 3 ). In the second step, feature vectors were extracted from the cleaned data and used as input to develop an algorithm able to detect L. monocytogenes in sterile saline samples. Each feature vector was calculated based on the following: (a) the average values (mean) for each cleaned dataset and (b) the rolling average with rolling window size 50 (minimum sums) [30] . This procedure was applied in each electrode channel (channel 1, channel 2, etc.) and the overall test dataset (mean average and minimum sums average for all 8 electrodes) ( Figure 4 ). Hence, from the initial experimental raw dataset with 360 \u00d7 8 values, only 1 \u00d7 18 (1 values for each channel (8 values in total) + 1 overall value/(a) and (b)) feature values were used for the sample discrimination and the algorithm development.

Algorithm: The algorithm used the feature vectors from the previous step as input to produce/calculate the final results. Two thresholds were set for mean values and minimum sums Biosensors 2020, 10, 178 7 of 13 values and were compared to the respective values from each channel and from the average of the channels. Four primary results were extracted based on the following: (i) threshold comparing to each channel mean values, (ii) threshold comparing to the average mean value, (iii) threshold comparing to each channel minimum sums values, and (iv) threshold comparing to the average minimum sums values. In the case of each channel comparison (i and iii), the obtained result was the predominant one (e.g., if 5 electrodes gave \"positive\" result and 3 gave \"negative\"' result based on the threshold, the result would be \"positive\"). The final result was the predominant result obtained from the above calculations (e.g., if (i) channel mean values, \"positive\"; (ii) average mean value, \"positive\", (iii) channel minimum sums values, \"negative\", and (iii) average minimum sums values: \"positive\", the final result would be \"positive\"). In the case of two \"positive\" and two \"negative\", the final result was the one obtaining from the average minimum sums value ( Figure 5 ).",

If they remain bounded, the second F(ab) domain has an opportunity to bind to any other antigen. Consequently, the equilibrium surface concentration of bounded IgG molecules, which increases with the surface concentration of the antigens, is the sum of two contributions. Therefore, antibodies which bound through a single F(ab) lead to a lower surface equilibrium.",

In this way, antibodies that are immobilized onto the surfaces in a relatively higher density will induce locally crowded areas. Cho et al.
