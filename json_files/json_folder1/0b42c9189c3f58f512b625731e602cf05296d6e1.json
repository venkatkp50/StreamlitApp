Children's 25(OH)D levels and the proportion of children with vitamin D deficiency were compared between different observation periods. Results: The mean serum 25(OH)D level was 84 \u00b1 25nmol/L. The overall proportion of children with vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D level <50 nmol/L) was 4.6%. Home confinement led to an increase in the proportion of children aged 3-6 years with vitamin D deficiency during March 1-June 30, 2020 compared with the same months in previous years, and the most noticeable increase was found in March 2020. In children aged 3-6 years, 25(OH)D levels were lower in 2020 (65 \u00b1 17nmol/L) than during 2017-2019, and the proportion of those with vitamin D deficiency was higher in 2020 (19.0%) than in previous years. Among children aged 0.5-1 and 1-3 years, 25(OH)D levels were higher (97 \u00b1 25 nmol/L, 91 \u00b1 27 nmol/L), while the proportion of children with vitamin D deficiency was lower in 2020 (2.3%, 3.0%) than during 2017-2019. Conclusion: The 25(OH)D levels tended to decrease gradually with increasing age. Reduced sunlight exposure during confinement is associated with lower 25(OH)D levels among children aged 3-6 years. Therefore, vitamin D supplementation for children aged >3 years is recommended.",

To reduce the rate of virus transmission, the Chinese government implemented a series of social distancing policies, restricting travel and movement and requiring a greater physical distance between people in public spaces. 1,2 Levels 1 and 2 of public health response, including the shutdown of public transportation systems, travel restrictions, and temperature measurement of people entering public spaces, were initiated in Guangdong Province between January 23 and May 8, 2020. Residents were encouraged to work from home and leave home only for essential activities. Moreover, the Spring Festival holiday was extended, and return to work and school was postponed. Libraries, factories, and government agencies were temporarily closed. 3 Although these measures helped to reduce COVID-19 transmission rates, 4 they were associated with short-and long-term consequences. Indeed, reduced physical activity due to confinement is likely to increase the adoption of unhealthy lifestyles, thereby increasing the prevalence of risk factors for noncommunicable diseases and exacerbating existing clinical problems. 5 In addition, an online survey of Canadian parents evaluated changes in children's play and exercise patterns during pandemic-related confinement and showed that up to 95.2% of children and 99.4% of youth did not get the recommended amount of physical activity. 6 These findings suggest that pandemic-related confinement affects children's well-being and health.",

The Endocrine Society's clinical practice guidelines recommend that vitamin D status should be divided into deficiency, insufficiency, and sufficiency, corresponding to 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels of <50, 50-75, and \u226575 nmol/L, respectively. 7 Sources of vitamin D include cutaneous synthesis from cholecalciferol upon exposure to ultraviolet-B light, specific foods, and dietary supplements. Notably, even among individuals who have a high intake of vitamin D-containing products and those who live in higher than mid-latitude regions, sunlight exposure remains an essential factor in maintaining sufficient 25(OH)D levels. 8 Consistently, our previous studies also have shown that in Guangzhou, a city in southern China with a subtropical climate and sufficient sunlight exposure, children and pregnant women tend to have vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency. 9, 10 Pandemic-related confinement reduces the amount of time spent outdoors, particularly among children. It is likely that 25(OH)D levels in children were lower during the period of confinement than otherwise. To verify our hypothesis, we conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study to compare 25(OH)D levels among children before and after pandemic-related confinement in the Guangzhou area of southern China (23\u00b070 N, 113\u00b015 E).",

We extracted data on date of birth, sex, date of hospital visits, and 25(OH)D levels, which were stored in the Hospital Information System. Plasma 25(OH)D levels were determined using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (Abbott Laboratories, Lake Bluff, IL, USA) with an intra/inter-assay coefficient of variation of <10.0%. Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency were defined as 25(OH)D levels of <50 and 50-75 nmol/L, respectively, according to the Endocrine Society's clinical practice guidelines. 7 Children were examined between March 1 and June 30, 2020 (ie, during the period when confinement measures were introduced from January 23 to May 8, 2020), and their 25(OH)D levels were compared with those in children examined over the equivalent quarter during 2017-2019.

            "text": "The present findings are related to public health policies in China. Lack of regular vitamin D supplementation, reduced intake of dietary products fortified with vitamin D, insufficient sunlight exposure, and reduced amounts of outdoor activities contribute to vitamin D deficiency in older children. Prolonged confinement is associated with reduced exposure to sunlight, which is associated with a lower rate of cutaneous vitamin D synthesis. As expected, in the present study, 25(OH)D levels measured in 2020 among children aged 3-6 years were lower than those measured in previous years among children at the same age, while the proportion of children with vitamin D deficiency was higher in 2020 than in previous years. To DovePress prevent vitamin D-related rickets, vitamin D at a dose of 400 IU/day is administered to infants up to 2 years of age. As children aged <3 years took daily vitamin D supplements, their 25(OH)D levels were not affected by pandemic-related confinement. In fact, 25(OH)D levels of children aged <3 years in 2020 were higher than those of their peers measured during the same period in previous years.",

During home confinement, access to food and medication was not significantly restricted. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many medical centers have shifted from person-to-person appointments to providing telemedicine and online services. Some medical centers provide online drug-related services, including placing orders, making payments, and arranging drug prescription and delivery. 13, 14 A study of the dietary diversity of China's residents indicates that online services have likely helped residents maintain a diversified diet during pandemic-related confinement. 15 This finding suggests that internet access and online services can help ensure that people continue to receive vitamin D supplements and fortified dietary products during pandemic-related confinement.",

The present study is associated with the following limitations. First, in China, the preventive use of vitamin D is common among healthy children aged <3 years; however, similar preventive supplementation is rare among older children. As this study included participants from both groups, the present findings are unlikely to be representative in the general population. Second, due to lack of participant dietary information, including details of daily vitamin D intake, we were unable to control for the effect of vitamin D intake on the present findings; these factors might have resulted in biased estimates. Third, this retrospective study did not account for the amount or duration of sunlight exposure among participants. Variations in sunlight exposure between participants might have biased our findings. Fourth, the present study was based on a single measurement of 25(OH)D levels and did not account for its longitudinal changes. In addition, there was no detailed information on parathyroid hormone in this study. Therefore, we cannot assess the associations between parathyroid hormone and 25(OH)D levels in children. Finally, the diversity of vitamin D receptors might also affect individual 25(OH)D levels; however, this aspect was outside the scope of the present study.",
