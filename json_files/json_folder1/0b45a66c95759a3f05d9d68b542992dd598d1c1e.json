Single-wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT) and multiple-wall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) are nanoparticles embedded in the host fluid. e dimensionless highly nonlinear differential equations (DEs) are solved via numerical scheme bvp4c. e effects of the physical parameters on heat transfer are presented in the form of graphs. e results demonstrate that the heat transfer is enhanced by using solid particle frictions (SWCNT and MWCNT). e large estimation of a magnetic parameter declines the velocity component. e current and existing results with their comparisons are shown in the tabular form for the validation of our code. e current results are in good agreement with their existing results. Generally, fuzziness or uncertainty is inherent in modeling, analysis, and experimentation. Due to the uncertain environmental conditions, fuzziness broadly exists in various engineering heat transfer problems. In this work, the nanoparticles' volume fraction of the SWCNT and MWCNT is taken as uncertain parameters in terms of triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs). e TFNs are controlled by the \u03b1 \u2212 cut which has less computational effort for analyzing the fuzziness or uncertainties. Also, a comparison between the SWCNT and MWCNT through the membership function and the variability of the uncertainty is studied.",

            "text": "e study of the flow of third-grade fluids [1] [2] [3] over an inclined channel is an important application in engineering, science, and technology. Some of these applications can be found in materials manufactured by the extraction procedure particularly in polymer processing, the flow of synovial fluid in human joints, geological flows inside the Earth's mantle, microfluids, drilling of oil and gas wells, etc. In fluid dynamics, the study of fundamental flow, namely, Couette flows to attract the researchers by several non-Newtonian fluids because of their uses in the technology and engineering industry. e unidirectional flow is used in polymer engineering such as die flow, injection molding, extrusion, plastic forming, continuous casting, and asthenosphere flows [4] [5] [6] [7] . Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) deals with the study of the motion of electrical fluids in the presence of a magnetic field. MHD flow has significant importance applications in the inclined channel such as geophysical, astrophysical, metallurgical processing, MHD generators, pumps, geothermal reservoirs, polymer technology, and mineral industries. MHD fluid uses as a lubricant to stop the unexpected variation of fluid viscosity with temperature under certain norms. ermal radiation is a process by which energy, in the form of electromagnetic radiation, is emitted by a heated surface in all directions and travels directly to its point of absorption at the speed of light; thermal radiation does not require an intervening medium to carry it. ermal radiation plays an important role in science and technology, such as the furnace design, glass production, ship compressors, space vehicles, plasma physics, propulsion systems, spacecraft, flow structure of atomic plants, internal combustion engines, combustion processes, gas turbines, solar radiations, and solar power technology. Kamran and Siddique [8] calculated the analytical solutions for MHD flow between infinite parallel plates. Siddiqui et al. [9] calculated the deliberated flow of a third-grade fluid between two inclined parallel plates with heat transfer using the homotopy perturbation method (HPM). Aiyesimi et al. [10] studied the MHD Couette flow and Poiseuille flow problems using the homotopy perturbation method (HPM) and perturbation method (PM). ey examined that both methods have the same solutions. Later on, Aiyesimi et al. [11] studied the solution of MHD Couette flow and Poiseuille flow problems of the temperature and velocity profile utilizing the perturbation method (PM). Yusuf et al. [12] studied the Couette flow with the effect of Soret, Dufour, and thermal radiation using the modified domain decomposition method (MADM) in an inclined channel. Okedayo et al. [13] used the MADM to study the viscous dissipation, Joule heating, and MHD flow of a thirdgrade fluid in an inclined channel. Farooq et al. [14] used the PM to study the Poiseuille flow of a couple of stress fluids with variable viscosity between two parallel inclined heated plates. Zeeshan et al. [15] studied the impact of variable thermal conductivity, heat generation, heat flux, and inclined uniform magnetic field on Poiseuille flow employing the homotopy analysis method (HAM). In this way, there are large kinds of literature about MHD and thermal radiation such as [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] .",

            "text": "Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are cylindrical shape materials made of graphene. ere are two types of CNTs, SWCNT and MWCNT, which are used in this work. As compared to other nanomaterials, SWCNT and MWCNT are of great importance for scholars due to their significant thermal conductivities, bent without any damage, and mechanical power. Saqib et al. [28] studied natural convection flow using carboxymethyl cellulose (CMS) as a base fluid and CNTs as hybrid nanofluids between two vertical parallel plates. For the exact solution, the Caputo-Fabrizio fractional derivative with the Laplace transform method is used. Hatami and Ganji [29] discussed the natural convection flow of sodium alginate (SA) as a base fluid and copper (Cu) and silver (Ag) as a nanofluid between two vertical parallel plates using the differential transform method (DTM). Khan et al. [30] studied the Navier slip boundary conditions for heat transfer using CNTs. Noreen et al. [31] studied the velocity slips and thermal analysis on MHD peristaltic flow in an asymmetric channel using CNTs. Ebaid and Al Sharif [32] deliberated the effect of MHD on nanofluids' motion using CNTs and enhanced the heat transfer rate. e flow and heat transport of a special kind of second-grade hybrid Al 2 O 3 + Cu/H 2 O nanofluid over a permeable stretching/shrinking sheet was addressed by Roy and Pop [33] . e flow of fluids with heat transfer is essential in science and engineering. After controlling the physical quantities like chemical diffusion, magnetic effect, volume friction of nanoparticles, and heat transmission, the fluid models are transformed into linear and nonlinear DEs. After governing these physical problems, they are converted into linear or nonlinear DEs. In general, the physical problems with involved geometry, coefficients, parameters, and initial and boundary conditions greatly affect the solution of DEs. en, the coefficients, parameters, and initial and boundary conditions are not crisp due to the mechanical defect, experimental error, and measurement error. So, in this situation, fuzzy set theory is a powerful tool for a better understanding of the considered phenomena, and it is more accurate than assuming the crisp or classical physical problems. To be more specific, FDEs play a significant role in reducing uncertainity and providing a correct approach to characterise a physical issue with unknown parameters, initial and boundary conditions.",

            "text": "In 1965, Zadeh [34] presented the fuzzy set theory (FST). FST is a very valuable tool to define the situation in which information is imprecise, vague, or uncertain. FST is completely defined by its membership function or belongingness, and the membership function describes each element of the universe of discourse by a number from the [0, 1] interval. On the contrary, the degree of nonbelongingness is a complement to \"one\" of the membership degree or belongingness. Fuzzy number (FN) can be expected as a function whose range is specified from zero to one. Every numerical value in the range is allocated a definite grade of the membership function where zero signifies the minimum possible grade and one is the maximum possible grade. Arithmetic operations on FNs were developed by Dubois and Prade [35] . Different types of FNs can be categories in triangular, 2 Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience trapezoidal, and Gaussian fuzzy numbers. Here, we consider TFNs for the sake of completeness. Also, many scholars have applied FST to obtain well-known results in the field of commerce and science [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] . e information of dynamical systems modeled by partial or ordinary differential equations is commonly incomplete, vague, or uncertain, while FDEs represent a proper way to model the dynamical systems under vagueness or uncertainty. is impreciseness or vagueness can be defined mathematically using FNs or TFNs. In recent years, there have been many studies revolving around the concept of FDEs. Seikala [47] introduced the fuzzy differentiability concept. Later on, Kaleva [48] presented fuzzy differentiation and integration. Kandel and Byatt [49] introduced the FDEs in 1987. Buckley et al. [50] used two methods' extension principle and FNs for the solution of FDEs. Gasilov et al. [51] studied the system of FDEs with the TFNs. Salahshour et al. [52] studied the fuzzy logistic equation and alley effect using FDEs with the help of TFNs. Biswal et al. [53] studied the natural convection of nanofluid flow between two parallel plates using the HPM in a fuzzy environment. e volume fraction of nanoparticles is considered as the TFN and also shows that the fuzzy result is better than a crisp result. Borah et al. [54] discussed the MHD flow of second-grade fluids in a fuzzy environment using fractional derivatives Atangana-Baleanu and Caputo-Fabrizio. e nondimensional governing equations are converted into fuzzified governing equations with the help of the Zadeh extension principle and triangular fuzzy number. MHD and ohmic heating on the third-grade fluid in an inclined channel in a fuzzy environment was investigated by Nadeem et al. [55] . To discuss the uncertainty, the triangle membership function was used.",

Furthermore, after checking the accuracy of bvp4c, the results of existing works in the literature are compared. e nanoparticles' volume fraction performs the main role in the enhancement of heat transfer and thermophysical properties. e particular applications of nanoparticles are in solar water heating, engine cooling, cooling of transformer oil, cooling of the radiator, cooling in machining, and defense. Some researchers take nanoparticles' volume fraction 0 to 4% for the enhancement of heat transfer. However, from different sources [25] [26] [27] , we can take nanoparticles' volume fraction more than 20% for better performance of heat transfer. So, the volume fraction of nanoparticles (SWCNTs and MWCNTs) is taken as a fuzzy number or uncertain because it depends on the added nanoparticle volume or dimensions of particles or the shape of particles of the fluid. In this respect, volume fraction has been taken as an uncertain parameter in terms of fuzzy numbers in the present study. To handle this problem in a fuzzy environment, FDEs and the triangular fuzzy plot with the \u03b1 \u2212 cut approach were used. Also, the comparison of SWCNTs and MWCNTs is discussed through triangular fuzzy plots.",

            "text": "In this section, pure water (H 2 O) is chosen as a base fluid, and SWCNT and MWCNT are nanoparticles added into the base fluid to enhance the heat transfer rate between two heated inclined parallel plates. e numerical solutions of governing coupled nonlinear differential equations are achieved through numerical technique bvp4c. e effect of crisp thermophysical parameters, such as nanoparticle volume fraction \u03c8, gravitational parameter K, magnetic parameter M, Brinkman number Br, and nondimensionless non-Newtonian viscosity \u03b2, on velocity and temperature profiles is drawn in Figures 3-8 . Tables 3 and 4 show the comparison of velocity and temperature fields for different values of \u03b2 [10, 11] when K \ufffd 1, Br \ufffd 5, M \ufffd 5, N \ufffd 0, and \u03c8 \ufffd 0. e validation of our results of the present study was found to be in excellent agreement. Figure 3 demonstrates the impact of \u03b2 on velocity and temperature profiles when other parameters are fixed. It is seen that the velocity and temperature of the nanofluid increase with increasing the values of \u03b2 because of the increase in the boundary layer thickness. Figure 4 displays the influence of gravitational parameter K on velocity and temperature profiles when other physical parameters are fixed. It is noticed that the velocity and temperature of the nanofluid rise rapidly in the center of the inclined plates with increasing the values of K. e reason is that when K increases, the upper plate movement expands the nanofluid velocity, which strengthens Joule dissipation; thereby, the rate of heat transfer is enhanced. e effect of M on the velocity and temperature profile is seen in Figure 5 . When the value of M is increased, the velocity drops due to the Lorentz forces, but the temperature profile rises. e rate at which the nanofluid flow declines is less noticeable from the lower plate to the higher plate. Physically, when the magnetic parameter rises, the rate of nanofluid flow near the moving upper plate is significantly reduced compared to the stationary lower plate. Also, it is noticed that increases in the magnetic parameter cause an increase in Joule heating, which raises the heat transfer rate. Figure 6 visualizes the effect of N on the nanofluid of the temperature profile. As depicted, it is seen that the temperature profile performs a decreasing function with increasing N, therefore, representing a damping impact on the heat transfer performance and nanofluid flow. e effect of the viscous dissipation parameter Br on the temperature profile is demonstrated in Figure 7 . It is observed that the temperature of the nanofluid increases with increasing the values of Br. e physical meaning of Br is when Br increases, the dissipation of heat in the boundary layer region increases, so the flow of the nanofluid is enhanced, and the heat transfer rate grows. e effect of \u03c8 via the velocity profile of nanomaterials SWCNT and MWCNT is shown in Figure 8 (a). When \u03c8 increases, the velocity of the nanofluid decreases. e velocity of the regular fluid is maximum at \u03c8 \ufffd 0, which means that, by increasing the nanofluid volume fraction, it becomes denser. Physically, it means that the boundary layer of nanofluids is thicker than regular fluids; consequently, the velocity shows a decreasing behavior with increasing values of \u03c8. e effect of \u03c8 on the temperature profile of nanomaterials SWCNT and MWCNT is depicted in Figure 8(b) . It can be seen that the temperature profiles increase with an increase in \u03c8. Physically, this is true because of the thicker thermal boundary layer which increases the heat transfer. Now, we discuss the nanoparticles' volume fraction of the SWCNTand MWCNT in a fuzzy environment. e governing equations of momentum and energy are converted into FDEs; then, the bvp4c scheme is employed for the numerical solution. e nanoparticle volume fraction \u03c8 is taken as TFN (see Table 2 ). Moreover, we utilized the \u03b1-cut approach (0\u2264\u03b1\u22641) to analyze the uncertainty. en, the velocity and temperature profiles are said to be fuzzy. e \u03b1-cut controls the fuzzy terms, for instance, if \u03b1-cut \ufffd 0, it will cover the whole interval of nanoparticles' volume fraction; that is, \u03c8 \ufffd [0, 0.2]. \u03b1-cut increases as (0.05 to 0.95) the width of lower and upper bounds of fuzzy velocity or temperature profiles decreases. When \u03b1-cut \ufffd 1, then the lower and upper bounds of fuzzy velocity or temperature profiles are coherent with each other, so they provide a crisp result. It is important to note that if the width between lower and upper bounds of the velocity or temperature profile is less, the uncertainty is less. e fuzzy velocity and temperature profiles are plotted in Figures 9 and 10 for some particular values of \u03b1-cut, (\u03b1 \ufffd 0, 0.3, 0.6, and 1). e triangular membership functions are depicted in Figures 11  and 12 for different values of y. Figures 9 and 10 show the nanoparticles' volume fraction of SWCNTs and MWCNTs taken as the TFN (see in Table 1 ); then, the fuzzy velocity and temperature profiles When \u03b1-cut increases, the width between u 1 (y, \u03b1) and u 2 (y, \u03b1) decreases, and at \u03b1-cut \ufffd 1, they coherent with one another which is a real flow of the nanofluid. It is noted that the width between u 1 (y, \u03b1) and u 2 (y, \u03b1) is very less, so the uncertainty is less. e effect of the \u03b1-cut on temperature profile \u03b8(y, \u03b1) is represented in Figures 9(b) and 10(b) for the fuzzy volume fraction of SWCNTs and MWCNTs, respectively. e lower bound of the temperature profile shows the regular fluid, and the upper bound of the temperature profile shows the nanofluid at \u03b1 \ufffd 0. Physically, it means that, at \u03b1 \ufffd 0, the thermal boundary layer of \u03b8 1 (y, \u03b1) is denser, and the thermal boundary layer of \u03b8 2 (y, \u03b1) is thinner. Momentum and thermal boundary layers show opposite behavior at \u03b1 \ufffd 0, which shows that the heat transfer is maximum. When \u03b1-cut increases, the width between \u03b8 1 (y, \u03b1) and \u03b8 2 (y, \u03b1) decreases, and at \u03b1-cut \ufffd 1, they coherent with one another which is the real flow of the nanofluid. It is noted Figures 11 and 12 represent the fuzzy plots of fuzzy velocity and temperature profiles for different values of y. e fuzzy velocity of SWCNTs is greater than the fuzzy velocity of MWCNTs. Physically, it is correct because the density of SWCNTs is less than the density of MWCNTs. Comparing for the fuzzy temperature distribution, SWCNTs have greater thermal conductivity than MWCNTs but less density. So, SWCNTs bear more heat than MWCNTs, and in this study, we suggest that SWCNTs are better for the enhanced heat transfer as compared to MWCNTs. Also, the SWCNTs show better behavior as compared to MWCNTs because of their less width according to the membership function. ",
