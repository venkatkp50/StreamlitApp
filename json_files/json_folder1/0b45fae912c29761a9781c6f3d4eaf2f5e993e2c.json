Reports of sepsis, DIC high D-dimer, raised inflammatory CRP, and procalcitonin [3, 4] can lead to the conclusion that the hypercoagulability criteria in Virchow's triad is the leading thrombogenic factor in COVID-19. Development of cardiac thrombus (RV) is a rare finding. Right ventricular thrombus formation is a potential complication of ARVC with impaired right ventricular function [5] . As in LV thrombus of formation, the conventional treatment is to receive a therapeutic dose of heparin (either conventional or LMWH). In acutely formed right ventricular thrombus as in this case, we consulted a neurologist for further management with dose of enoxaparin in the presence of acute CVA. He suggested that we should start on a prophylactic dose of 40 mg s.c. b.i.d., repeat CT scan after 24 h, and if no progression occurs, then to consider a full therapeutic dose of enoxaparin.",
