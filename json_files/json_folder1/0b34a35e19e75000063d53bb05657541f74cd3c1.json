[3] [4] [5] [6] Based on the World Health Organization (WHO), obesity is defined as 'abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health'. 7 Obesity results from a combination of inherited factors, environmental, socioeconomic, personal diet and exercise choice. 8 Bariatric surgery is one of the safest and best choices for treatment of obesity and has evolved in the United States and worldwide over the past two decades and is done to help patients lose excess weight and reduce the risk of potentially life-threatening weightrelated health problems. Bariatric surgery is a method of treatment that can be used in the case of patients with BMI \u226535 kg/m 2 and with coexisting complications of obesity, such as arterial hypertension or diabetes, or with BMI \u226540 kg/m for normal individuals. 9 However, the most popular bariatric surgery procedures are Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG), 10-12 these methods are not free from complications, and the most common ones are micronutrient deficiencies because of preoperative malnutrition, decreased food intake due to reduced hunger, and increased satiety and food intolerance or vomiting 13 which lead to a series of mental problems such as depression after surgery. 14, 15 Moreover, many patients have symptoms of depression after BS, but there are few prospective studies to specify their prevalence after surgery. [16] [17] [18] [19] The neurological findings diagnosed with common post-operative malnutrition include encephalopathy, polyradiculoneuropathy, optic neuropathy, myelopathy and polyneuropathy. 20 These symptoms are more frequent in subjects who are noncompliant to medical visits in the long term after surgery. 12 We aim to evaluate the prevalence of depression after SG in morbidly obese subjects in a narrow period of time on Iranian population.",

The main reason for the criteria was to avoid any interference in overall evaluation. For instance, people from other countries may be from different levels of economic situation, awareness and culture which may affect this analysis. Also, we tried to include and distribute the statistical population equally in three economic classes of low income, middle income and high income in order to evaluate the relationship of financial situation and clinical depression following sleeve gastrectomy. In this report, our main focus was on SG rather than other types of bariatric surgery. Therefore, our target group was the individuals who underwent SG in order to find out more psychological aspects of this specific method. We assumed the entire information from Jan 2020 would not be reliable due to the COVID-19 pandemic and has been excluded from the study (increase in prevalence of depression due to quarantine, economic limitations and other situations among populace has been reported previously).",

Based on a study on extremely obese patients who underwent gastric banding or gastric bypass, the prevalence of depressive disorders declined significantly after surgery. 27 In another study, it has been claimed that bariatric surgery had a positive impact on depressive features among patient who underwent RYGB and laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) procedures. However, data suggested some deterioration in improvement after the first post-operative year in this survey. 28 One another report stated that, RYGB, LAGB and SG surgeries, may lead to a mild alleviation in clinical depression in subjects over the initial post-operative years but this was not maintained. 29",
