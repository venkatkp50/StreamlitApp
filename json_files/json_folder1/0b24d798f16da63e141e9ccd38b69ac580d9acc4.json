For clinicians to effectively counsel patients on self-weighing, they should be aware of the costs and features available in typical home scales. Our objective was to describe the cost and features of the top bathroom scales available online. We performed content analysis of top 100 scales listed on a popular online retailer. Two coders independently extracted price and scale features (i.e., digital connectivity, body mass index [BMI] calculation, maximum weight accommodated). We used t-tests and ANOVA, as appropriate, to examine the relationships between price and features. Among the 97 scales included, mean scale price was $28.99 (SD $21.06; range $7.20-$139.95). Of the advanced features, 20.6% of scales had digital connectivity and 28.9% calculated BMI. Scales with advanced features cost significantly more than scales without (digital connectivity: $49.18 vs. $23.74, P < 0.001; BMI calculation: $42.92 vs. $23.33, P < 0.001). Most scales (76.2%) had a maximum weight of 351-400 lbs, and only 17.5% could accommodate >400 lbs. Price was higher for scales with a higher maximum weight (P = 0.002). No scale with maximum weight > 500 lbs had advanced features. Scales that have digital connectivity for telemedicine or can accommodate higher weights are less commonly available online and their costs may be prohibitive for some patients who need these features. Future research might consider testing whether insurance coverage for scales improves scale access and patient weight management outcomes.",

            "text": "Individuals with overweight or obesity have increased risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and several forms of cancer. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Sustained weight loss of as little as 3-5% can produce clinically meaningful reductions in cardiometabolic risk factors and reduces the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. 7 In most of these behavioural weight-loss interventions, the intervention includes three major components-dietary modification, increased physical activity, and behavioural strategies to promote and sustain lifestyle change. 7 Self-monitoring is an evidence-based behavioural weight-loss strategy grounded in behaviour change theory, which includes tracking weight. 8 Self-weighing promotes weight loss by helping individuals catch gains in weight and alert them to alter behaviours before the weight gain becomes significant. 9 Self-weighing is more effective for weight loss than self-monitoring energy intake or activity among adults, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] and adherence with self-weighing is generally higher than for monitoring these other components. [17] [18] [19] More frequent self-weighing, such as daily weighing, results in better weight loss and weight loss maintenance. 11, 12 Having a scale in the home may increase feasibility of daily weighing. Industry standards for accuracy exist for home scale manufacturers 20, 21 and prior research has shown that digital home scales are generally accurate. 22 To identify accurate scales, patients may rely upon assessments from consumer associations-some reports are freely available, while others may charge a fee to access. 23, 24 A recent study showed that most primary care patients are willing to self-weigh and to own a scale. 25 Home scales may facilitate the primary care clinician's ability to support patients between clinic visits-whether self-weighing is indicated for weight loss to treat obesity or for routine monitoring as part of heart failure management. However, buying a scale can be financially challenging for patients, particularly for low-income individuals. 25, 26 No broad insurance coverage currently exists to cover home scales as durable medical equipment; therefore, patients incur all costs. To date, no studies have described the typical costs to buy a home scale-an essential component for clinicians to discuss when counselling patients.",

In this setting, digital connectivity technologies (e.g., WiFi, Bluetooth) to transmit weights to the clinic can be invaluable for clinical care. However, patients would have to purchase a scale with such technology. Another important scale feature for clinical care is the weight maximum, as patients need to ensure that the scale can accommodate their weight. Other accessibility features such as a wall-mount display or audio function may help patients use scales who have disabilities (e.g., visual impairment). To date, no studies have determined the prevalence of scales with these features and whether such features are associated with increased scale costs.",

We found that the average cost of best-selling home scales was approximately $29. Most scales did not offer digital connectivity technologies. In addition, few scales could accommodate patients over 400 lbs and very few offered features like audio function that can be key for patients with certain disabilities. Patients who need these features have limited options from which to choose. In contrast, features like body fat analysis and BMI calculation were available in over 25% of scales. The utility of these measures as part of self-weighing is unclear, and assessments of body composition through bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) may be subject to measurement error. 31 We also found that scales with features such as digital connectivity, body fat analysis, BMI calculation, and ability to accommodate greater body weights were more expensive. Given that prior research has identified cost as a common barrier for low-income patients in accessing scales, 25, 26 these patients who would like to participate in telemedicine using digital connectivity or who have higher body weights may have difficulties finding a scale that they can afford with the features that they need. In contrast, clinicians could advise patients that they do not need to pay more for a scale that has body fat analysis and BMI calculation, as these estimates do not have a clear role in self-weighing.",

There is precedence for insurance coverage of durable medical equipment, such as blood pressure cuffs, glucometers, continuous positive airway pressure devices, nebulizers, wheel-chairs, and oxygen equipment. 32 Clinicians could apply this existing infrastructure for prescribing durable medical equipment to scales, so that these devices could be delivered to patients' homes or available at pharmacies. Previously, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) extended Medicare coverage of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring devices in response to a formal request for widened coverage determination from medical organizations including the American Heart Association and American Medical Association. 33 The results of this study may contribute to the evidence to support future efforts by organizations such as The Obesity Society or the American Board of Obesity Medicine to lobby CMS to extend this coverage to Medicare beneficiaries.
