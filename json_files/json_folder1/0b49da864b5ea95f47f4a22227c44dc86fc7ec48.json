Materials and methods Patients affected by morbid obesity, without symptoms of GERD, who were never in therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), were randomized into two groups. One group underwent SG and the other SG + RF. The study was stopped on February 2020 due to the COVID pandemic. Results A total of 278 patients of the programmed number of 404 patients were enrolled (68.8%). De novo esophagitis was considered in those patients who had both pre-and postoperative gastroscopy (97/278, 34.9%). Two hundred fifty-one patients (90.3%) had completed clinical follow-up at 12 months. SG + RF resulted in an adequate weight loss, similar to classic SG at 12-month follow-up (%TWL = 35. 4 \u00b1 7.2%) with a significantly better outcome in terms of GERD development. One year after surgery, PPIs were necessary in 4.3% SG + RF patients compared to 17.1% SG patients (p = 0.001). Esophagitis was present in 2.0% of SG + RF patients versus 23.4% SG patients (p = 0.002). The main complication after SG + RF was wrap perforation (4.3%), which improved with the surgeon's learning curve. Conclusion SG + RF seemed to be an effective alternative to classic SG in preventing de novo GERD. More studies are needed to establish that an adequate learning curve decreases the higher percentage of short-term complications in the SG + RF group.",

In both interventions, four trocars were used: 10 mm left sub-costal (optic view), 5 mm epigastric (liver retraction), 5 mm right hypochondrium (left hand), and 15 mm mesogastrium (right hand). The dissection of the gastro-colic ligament began at 3-4 cm from the pylorus and reached the left diaphragmatic pillar. At this point, the two interventions differed. In the patients undergoing SG + RF, the phreno-esophageal membrane was dissected. A minimal opening of the posterior crura was made to allow the retro-esophageal passage of the fundus. A 1.5-2 cm long, floppy, 360\u00b0 fundoplication was created over a 38Fr oro-gastric boogie, with two interrupted, non-absorbable, extracorporeal Roeder knots. No sutures on the esophagus were performed. After the formation of the fundoplication, the two procedures were continued and concluded in the same way. The stomach was sectioned over a 38Fr oro-gastric boogie with a linear articulable stapler (Tristaple Signia\u2122 stapling system, Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland). The choice of the type of cartridge depended on the tissue thickness, as usual. The main difference between the two interventions was the fact that at the level of the fundoplication, a black cartridge was used. An indocyanine green (ICG) test was performed at the end of the SG + RF intervention, to check the correct vascularization of the wrap, using IMAGE 1 S\u2122 RUBINA\u2122 system (KARL STORZ SE & CO.

This was related to a higher frequency of wrap perforation after fundoplication (4.3%) than the classic leakage following normal SG (0.7%). Wrap perforation differed from leakage after SG and never occurred along the staple line. It seemed to be related to traumatism of the gastric serosa due to excessive manipulation of the fundus during fundoplication, and usually appeared within the first 2-3 days after surgery. The increased pressure in the wrap during feeding might overwhelm the serosa resistance. Perforation could also be associated to ischemic issues. For this reason, at the end of every fundoplication, the wrap was checked with ICG test. Presentation was usually pain irradiated to left shoulder, fever, and leukocytosis. CT scan with oral water-soluble contrast was diagnostic for perforation and peri-gastric collection. The therapeutic approach was laparoscopic resection of the valve associated with a toilette of the abdominal cavity. The rate of wrap perforation (4.3%), 6 times higher than classic leakage (0.7%), could be alarming, but it decreased with the learning curve of the surgeon (Fig. 3) . In fact, during the last year of the study, from January 2019, no valve perforations were reported. In this period, 38 SG + RF were performed (27.5% of the total). Moreover, the hospital stay after wrap perforation and fundus resection was shorter (11.2 \u00b1 2.6 days) than the postoperative course after leakage in SG (39 days). No classic leakages were seen after SG + RF. This could be explained by the valve protecting the higher part of the stomach. After revision surgery for wrap perforation, one leakage was reported. While conducting this study, other than the efficacy of the surgical procedure itself, we noted the importance of the preoperative EGDS, even if it is not considered mandatory in the principal guidelines for bariatric surgery [24, 28, 29] . We found it essential for establishing the presence and the gravity of esophagitis, according to the LA classification. Moreover, from the literature, we know that more than 25% of patients without GERD symptoms may have unknown esophagitis [8] . The preoperative data about the condition of the EG junction mucosa may lead to the surgical choice of adding a fundoplication to SG, improving the postoperative condition of the patient.",

For this reason, it is important to select that 23.4% of patients affected by obesity without preoperative GERD who may benefit from the association between SG and fundoplication, to prevent de novo GERD. SG + RF may be the correct intervention for patients with preoperative EE (> B grade), and, to avoid de novo GERD, for those without GERD who have a hypotonic lesser esophageal sphincter (LES) at the manometry. Patients without GERD and with a normal LES may be the best candidate for normal SG.",
