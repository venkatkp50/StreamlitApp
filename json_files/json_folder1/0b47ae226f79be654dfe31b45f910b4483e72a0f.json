Non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) is the only public health approach to reduce transmission, control the pandemic and lower the disease burden. However, in the past few decades, people have not experienced extensive city lockdowns or physical distancing (also known as social distancing) policies. In some epidemics of influenza or enterovirus, some public health authorities have implemented school closures [2] or temporary class suspensions [3] , but rarely for a whole city. Unprecedented physical distancing policies have been implemented to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic in different countries [4] . Due to the huge socio-economic impacts from control policies, governments in different countries have set different stringency levels for physical distancing policies, taking into consideration feasibility [5] , the culture [6] , medical capacity [7] , social acceptance [6] , and economic loss [6] , and such policies have also evolved with the pandemic situation.",

In addition, epidemiological investigation has found that transmission occurs before the onset of symptoms [11] . These factors, as well as similarity of the symptoms to those of influenza, all increase the barrier to early detection of the disease. The different physical distancing policies have lowered the effective reproduction number (Rt) over time, aiming to interrupt the chain of transmission and maintain the Rt below 1.",

A previous simulation study showed that social distancing intervention starting earlier in an epidemic could delay the epidemic curve, and intervention introduced later could flatten the epidemic curve [7] . Empirically, the effectiveness of NPIs including travel restrictions, stay-at-home policies, school closures, cancelling public gatherings and so on has been reported on in different countries. In contrast to NPIs, public compliance affects the probability of transmission. With the technology of mobile devices, changes in human mobility can be measured in an aggregated fashion. Those data reflect human movements during an epidemic period under different physical distancing policies. This paper will primarily focus on only confirmed cases based on local transmission, which is a fair way to measure the policy effectiveness. The effective reproduction number (Rt) was used to measure transmissibility, based on time after introducing particular physical distancing interventions. In the real world, government policies and residents' compliance occur at the same time. In this study, we visualize the Rt and policy stringency in a spatio-temporal manner. We then compare the strategies of different NPIs and changes in human mobility in different countries. Finally, we model the effectiveness of NPIs and residents' compliance on reducing Rt with different lagged effects.",

All the data were captured from novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) situation reports published by the World Health Organization (https:// www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports). The data were updated daily starting January 21, 2020 and covered the situation of COVID-19 infection worldwide. The WHO Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) SITUATION REPORT presented transmission classification starting from February 28, 2020. Before that date, the WHO reported confirmed cases containing local and imported cases. From February 28, 2020 to April 8, 2020, daily reported laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 included transmission classification based on WHO analysis of available official data, and may be subject to reclassification as additional data become available. We extracted the data classified as \"local transmission\" in this study. Therefore, we searched for data from local sources on daily confirmed cases on each country's official website, found South Korea, Japan, and Singapore reported daily new local confirmed cases, and added these data into the analysis. In addition, Taiwan's daily local cases were not reported from the WHO, so we collected data between January 28, 2020 and April 8, 2020 from official press releases of the Taiwan CDC. We obtained Taiwan's daily confirmed, locally transmitted cases of COVID-19 from January 28, 2020 to April 8, 2020 from announcements by the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (https://www.cdc.gov.tw/En/ Bulletin/List/7tUXjTBf6paRvrhEl-mrPg).

We stratified different countries into two groups based on the median stringency index of 50. After examining the normality of the distribution, we used a random effects model with a random intercept to compare the difference in people's behavioral changes across two different stringency groups, and to figure out the relationship between policy stringency and people's behavioral changes. The variables of the stringency index and community mobility trends were evaluated in multivariable models using stepwise selection to eliminate those with p values >0.1 after excluding multicollinearity (variance inflation factor (VIF) > 10). The missing data including debt or contract relief (E2, n = 14), fiscal measures (E3, n = 6), emergency investment in healthcare (H4, n = 30), investment in vaccines (H5, n = 4) and community mobility data (n = 14) were excluded. We used linear mixed-effects models to explore the daily reproduction number with countries as a random effect. We also estimated 7-and 14-day lagged effects of policy on the time-varying reproduction number. All statistical tests were two-sided with a significance level of 0.05. All analyses were performed with R 4.0.0 statistical software. We used ArcGIS (ArcMap, version10.3; ESRI Inc., Redlands, CA, USA) and our developed ringmap toolbox (https://www.esri.com/about/newsroom/arcuser/looking-at-temporal-changes) to visualize the daily local confirmed cases, Rt and stringency scores in 17 countries during the study period.

In our findings, time-varying reproduction numbers surged rapidly at the initial epidemic stage and declined gradually depending on policy stringency. The human mobility reduction was greater in countries with stricter policies. By examining the 0-day, 7-day and 14-day lagged effects of policies and changes in human mobility on Rt, stay-at-home policies, workplace closures, limiting gatherings, international travel controls, contact tracing, less visiting and staying in parks, and reducing walking around were all effective at reducing Rt. In this study, the highest mean time-varying reproduction number was 2.13 in Vietnam, which means an average of 2.13 secondary cases generated by a primary case. Our estimated average time-varying reproduction numbers were 1.34 for Italy and 1.53 for South Korea. Compared to previous studies, the median value of the time-varying reproduction number for Italy's province of Macerata was 1.792 (1.0-3.5) with the exponential growth (EG) method, estimated with data from February 26, 2020 to April 20, 2020 [18] . The mean estimated reproduction number was 1.5 (1.4-1.6) on February 26, 2020 in South Korea [19] . A portion of COVID-19 cases were imported from other areas, which might lead the reproduction number to be overestimated due to \"imported cases\" (cases infected abroad who then entered the country, rather than being locally transmitted). Most countries required travelers to fill out a health declaration form, have their temperature measured, undergo self-quarantine and be tested for SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, if necessary. The probability of a potentially infected traveler spreading the disease to healthy local people declines with close confinement. Therefore, this study did not examine imported cases which were unrelated to transmission of local outbreaks. ",

At the same time, the effectiveness of each intervention is constantly being explored. The case number after intervention policies might be overcounted if the counts include infectees who were still asymptotic and undiagnosed before intervention. Thus, there were lags for the interventions to take effect. We assess the 0-day, 7-day and 14-day lagged effects as a sensitivity analysis. For the 0-day lagged effect scenario, workplace closure, restrictions on gatherings of over a certain number of people (ranging from over 100 to over 1000) and staying at home were effective in reducing the reproduction number. Working at home or work bans were effective when the workplace was a key infection site. Workplace distancing reduced the number of infections in simulation models based on geographical, demographic, and epidemiological data from Singapore [22] . In another study, under other control measures such as bans on public gatherings, prohibition of movement without valid reason, suspension of intra-city public transport and closure of entertainment venues, fewer confirmed cases were reported during the early stage of the outbreak [23] . However, school closures, cancelling public events, testing only those who both have symptoms and meet specific criteria, or open public testing result in increasing, not decreasing, reproduction numbers. The contribution of school closures to transmission control may depend on the features of a disease. There has been limited information about the effectiveness of school closures alone in coronavirus outbreaks such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). As S1 Table shows, we found an effect from implementing school closure policy alone on reducing the effective reproduction number. However, when we considered other NPI policies together, the effect of school closures disappeared. But for influenza outbreaks, school closures have been shown to be effective. There are several theoretical reasons promoted for the reduced effectiveness of school closures in containing COVID-19 compared to influenza outbreaks [24] . First, relatively few child diagnoses of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide. As of March 8, 2020 the largest proportion of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infectees was among the age group of 40-79 in Wuhan, China [25] . Secondly, studies elsewhere have shown that the symptoms are relatively mild in ",

Moreover, when only school closures are implemented, household and community contact tends to increase, such as at day care centers or parks, so the transmission risk does not change much [24] . Alternative measures such as distance learning and closing only confirmed cases' classes may be considered in the early stage of an outbreak. To sum up, we cannot rule out the possibility that the results of school closure in our study were affected by statistical imprecision such as measurement error, but the reversed effect of school closure in other studies might be related to interactions with other interventions. A policy of testing for SARS-CoV-2 may not work so well if testing is not performed until after onset of symptoms and time is needed to get the test results. For a 7-day lagged effect scenario, recommendations to work from home, required closure of workplaces for some sectors, restrictions on gatherings of over a certain number of people (ranging from over 100 to over 1000), requirements to stay at home, international travel controls (i.e. screening international airplane arrivals or total border closure), and contact tracing done for all identified cases were all effective in reducing the reproduction number. In a study on travel restrictions in China, the imported cases from Wuhan dropped under a travel ban which prevented people from traveling into and out of Wuhan [17] . The effectiveness of travel restrictions has been supported by studies modeling its effectiveness in preventing the spread of COVID-19, suggesting they are useful in the early stage of an outbreak when cases are limited to a certain area [22] . In the later stages of an epidemic, travel restrictions may be less effective due to the disease already being widespread [17] . The factors causing the reproduction number to rise were similar to those in a 0-day lagged effect scenario. For a 14-day lagged effect scenario, restrictions on gatherings of more than 10 people had the effect of decreasing the reproduction number, but limited contact tracing (not done for all cases) increased the reproduction number. Not tracing for all confirmed cases may be due to the fact that too many cases have been confirmed at the same time and some footprints are too complex to be recalled, resulting in some healthy people coming into contact with the infected person but not being discovered. If we replace the 11 policies with an NPI in our study, the results show that a stricter NPI policy inhibited an increase in the reproduction number, and show that a combination of different NPI policies was useful. People changed their behavior due to interventions and the threat of COVID-19. The same mobility pattern was found in the US from January 1 to April 20, 2020 [27] . These protective behaviors were related to concern over the severity of infection. Studies have shown that people tend to decrease their daily contacts, reduce trips to crowded places, and wear masks when leaving home during COVID-19 outbreaks [28] . People may integrate physical distancing into their lifestyle or postpone some activities until an epidemic wanes. Simulations in other studies have suggested that if people are in a state of panic such as panic-buying in a crowded area, physical distancing is of little use [29] . Using social incentives and support to educate people on the importance of physical distancing would be suitable in this kind of situation to inhibit spread of the virus.",
