A total of 476 teachers with OT experience completed online a self-report survey with items adapted from related scales. The hypotheses were validated using structural equation modeling. Causal relationships were assessed using path analysis, and multi-group analysis was performed to examine the moderating effect of MiT. JD-OT has significant and negative impact on PIE-OT, JR-OT has significant and positive impact on PIE-OT, and PIE-OT has significant and negative impact on EE. Moreover, PIE-OT mediates the positive relationship of JD-OT with EE and the negative relationship of JR-OT with EE. The moderating role of MiT in the relationship of JD-OT and JR-OT with PIE-OT was also validated. In OT work environments, teachers have great need and desire for JR, which can have a positive impact on PIE. Mindfulness training contributes to improving OT efficacy and reducing EE. Enhancing teachers' MiT enables them to deal with demands from work and their superiors and motivates them to respond with ease to the stressful external environment.",

In the education sector, schools are shut, and teachers and students are forced out of the classrooms. These drastic changes have resulted in a distinctive and unprecedented rise in remote or e-learning and online teaching (OT) worldwide. In Asia, Taiwan has been an outlier with face-to-face classes maintained during the pandemic till May 15, 2021. Following triple-digit numbers of domestically transmitted COVID-19 cases, schools at all levels were closed. On-site classes were suspended but teaching and learning continued through online platforms. Such transition though necessary is not easy; and the speedy response required under the pandemic does not allow changes to be implemented in small or steady steps.",

Not only do they switch from school-to homebased, the lessons, assignments, and assessments have to be tailored to the online format. This sudden shift of teaching delivery mode poses challenges to teachers for adapting and surviving in the new normal. In addition, it is expected of them to support students' academic development and psychological well-being throughout this transition. Teachers experienced considerable stress as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which was related to poorer mental health, coping, and teaching (Baker et al., 2021) . In view of the significant role of teachers in knowledge dissemination, it is important to ensure sufficient support and prompt assistance be rendered to facilitate their managing the drastic changes (Mishra et al., 2020) . Hence, an in-depth understanding of the challenges and predisposing factors of their stress and anxiety as well as how to help teachers overcome these problems would be of need and value.",

            "text": "Burnout in teachers has been broadly investigated, but limited studies have investigated burnout in teachers during a pandemic (Sokal et al., 2020) . In particular, because the environment changes so rapidly, the resources to cope with the changes are often not ready in time. Schools require teachers to teach online while still maintaining as much as possible the effectiveness of face-to-face teaching. Teachers need to spend extra time to make themselves familiar with the online teaching environment, designing methods to interest students in the teaching content and keep them learning about it (Scull et al., 2020) . This creates a great deal of psychological pressure on teachers. Prior organizational studies have found that job demands lead to constant psychological overtaxing and exhaustion (Bakker et al., 2008) while lack of job resources not only predicts burnout but also poor engagement (Schaufeli and Bakker, 2004) . In view of the core role of teachers in education, it is important to assess the psychological impact of OT, necessitated by COVID-19, on them and provide them with prompt support and assistance to reduce work pressure and improve teaching effectiveness (Mishra et al., 2020) . In particular, OT and e-learning would be the modus operandi till the pandemic is over and may even remain to some extent in its aftermath.",

Every individual has varied levels of mindfulness in different situations and time. Brown and Ryan (2003) referred to an individual's capacity of paying and maintaining attention to present moment experiences with an open and non-judgmental attitude as trait mindfulness or dispositional mindfulness. Moreover, individuals with higher trait mindfulness tend to have stronger self-regulated behavior and positive emotional states (Brown and Ryan, 2003) . Trait mindfulness has also been demonstrated to have positive downstream effects on workplace functioning (Dane, 2011; Glomb et al., 2011) .",

Resources, precious but limited, are spent in daily life and interactions. When faced with loss and lack of resources, psychological stress occurs. In response to such stress, individuals on one hand preserve their current resources and on the other hand pursue new ones. Whether successful or not, their attempts would be resource-depleting and emotionally taxing. Job burnout is a work-related stress that arises under excessive workload and pressure and leads to energy and emotional exhaustion as well as reduced performance. According to the COR, burnout at work occurs as a result of perceived or actual loss of energy under heavy job demands. For teachers, extra workload due to the new teaching delivery mode is energy-draining. In the absence of support or relief, their persistent efforts will eventually lead to job burnout.",

JD refer to those physical, psychological, social, or organizational aspects of the job that require sustained physical and/or psychological (cognitive and emotional) effort or skills and are therefore associated with certain physiological and/or psychological costs. Examples are work pressure, an unfavorable physical environment, and emotionally demanding interactions with clients. Although JD are not necessarily negative, they may turn into job stressors when meeting those demands requires high effort or competences that the employee is not equipped with. On the other hand, JR refer to those physical, psychological, social, or organizational aspects of the job that are instrumental to enhancing work engagement and organizational commitment as well as to achieving work goals and better performance (Bakker et al., 2003) . Examples are job autonomy, role clarity, collegial, and/or supervisory support.

OT necessitated by COVID-19 poses heavy a workload that demands teachers to make extra concentrated efforts as well as frequent interaction with students and parents, thus incurring psychological stress. With increasing JD of OT (JD-OT), internal resources are further exhausted. Worse still, if JR including work autonomy, school, and coworkers' support are lacking, OT would be even more energy-consuming. Continuous draining of energy and resources will result in burnout at high psychological cost (Lee and Ashforth, 1996) .",

In addition, workplace social support can lead to greater organizational commitment and dedication (Bakker et al., 2003) while a supportive school climate has a positive impact on teacher self-efficacy (Aldridge and Fraser, 2016) .

Signs of emotional exhaustion include fatigue, debilitation, loss of energy and wearing out (Schwarzer and Hallum, 2008) . Besides contributing to burnout, emotional exhaustion should be of concern due to its association with impairment of overall job performance, wellbeing, and health (Ducharme et al., 2007) . Teachers with low perceived self-efficacy are under great job stress and are likely to become emotionally exhausted (Schwarzer and Hallum, 2008) . According to the COR, teachers spend more time and effort to deal with JD-OT, thus exhausting their personal and internal resources. Persistent challenging demands in the absence of support will erode teachers' initial passion and enthusiasm, vitality and creativity, causing them to perceive themselves to be instructional inefficacious and eventually become emotionally exhausted. In view of this perspective, the following hypothesis is proposed.",

Taken together, these results evidenced the important mediating role of self-efficacy on both positive and negative feelings of teachers in the teaching environment. According to the COR, the amount of JD and JR would determine the amount of physical and psychological efforts required and the extent of resource depletion, which in turn affect the severity of EE.

In other words, MiT serves as a buffer against energy-draining JD, decreases resource consumption, and prevents emotional fatigue. Conversely, teachers without this positive trait will have no shield against the pressing and taxing JD, resulting in greater physical and psychological efforts paid, which may undermine PIE. In addition, according to the COR, positive traits can also be regarded as personal resources that can be invested in the teaching task to reduce the negative impact of physical and psychological exhaustion and low PIE.

Then, multigroup analysis (MGA) was performed on the H-MiT and L-MiT groups. First, the standard model (unrestricted model), which allows different path coefficients between groups, was applied, thus yielding a chi-square value (cunre 2 ). Then, the restricted model, which constrains all path coefficients of both groups to be equivalent, was applied, thus obtaining another chi-square value ( c re 2 ). The standard model and the restricted model are both nested models that can be statistically compared. A significantly lower \u0394\u03c7 2 value for the standard model (p < 0.05) indicates a poorer fit of the restricted model. The hypothesis with the same path coefficients across groups is rejected, thus verifying the moderating effect between high and low groups (Hair et al., 2009 ).

The differences in chi-square values of the two relationships above when assessed by standard and restricted models \u0394\u03c7 2 are 6.58 and 5.37 with p = 0.010 and p = 0.020, respectively. With both p-values less than 0.05, the hypothesis that the path coefficients are the same across groups is rejected. In other words, H5a and H5b are supported, evidencing the moderator role of MiT in the relationship of JD-OT and JR-OT with PIE-OT.",

On the basis of the COR and using JD-R model, this study explored the relationships of JD and JR with PIE and EE in an OT work environment to shed light on the psychological changes due to the sudden switch in teaching delivery mode necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the moderating effect of MiT was examined for a better understanding on its application in the field of education. Empirical data obtained from the online survey evidenced the impact of JD-OT and JR-OT on PIE-OT (H1 and H2, respectively). These results echoed previous findings on the negative effect of JD (Skaalvik and Skaalvik, 2019) as well as positive effect of JR and social support (Minghui et al., 2018; Skaalvik and Skaalvik, 2019 ) on teachers' sense of self-efficacy. A recent study of Ma et al. (2021a) attributed low PIE to the teachers' lack of OT experience and the school's inadequate support. The negative impact of PIE-OT on EE (H3) evidenced by the empirical data was also consistent with prior results on negative relationship of PIE with EE (Skaalvik and Skaalvik, 2010) and job burnout due to low PIE (Skaalvik and Skaalvik, 2007) .",

In summary, JD-OT undermines PIE but contribute to EE. Stress, physical efforts, and emotional load all cause low PIE, which indirectly leads to serious EE. On the contrary, JR-OT foster PIE but reduce EE. Work autonomy, social support, performance feedback, supervisory guidance, or development opportunities all promote PIE, which indirectly decreases EE. Of note is that the impact of JR-OT, both direct and indirect, is greater than JD-OT. This finding in an OT context echoes Ma et al.

In comparison, the mean PIE score of the L-MiT group (3.02; SE = 0.55) was significantly (p < 0.001) lower than that of the H-MiT group (3.56; SE = 0.66), indicating that teachers with high MiT do consider themselves performing better at OT. For teachers with low MiT, JD-OT does have negative but insignificant impact on PIE-OT (\u22120.14) while the impact of JR-OT on PIE-OT is both positive and significant (0.86). L-MiT teachers show greater need of external resources and tend to look out for external support in face of extra demands. The basic assumption of COR is that individuals strive to acquire, maintain, cultivate and protect their cherished resources (Hobfoll et al., 2018) . Hence, in face of pressed response and stressed requirement to enhance OT efficacy, the self-defense mechanism of L-MiT teachers is triggered, driving them to seek available resources for support while conserving their internal resources. This is consistent with one of the principles of COR. Hence JR-OT is of both need and importance to L-MiT teachers. As for teachers with high MiT, JD-OT have a negative and significant impact on PIE-OT (\u22120.34) while the impact of JR-OT on PIE-OT is both positive and significant (0.60). In comparison, the negative effect of JD-OT on PIE-OT was greater in H-MiT; the positive effect of JD-OT on PIE-OT was also greater in L-MiT than in H-MiT. Such difference can be attributed to the proactive attitude of H-MiT teachers toward JD-OT even at the expense of their internal resources, which would decrease PIE. High mindfulness enables teachers face JD not only through pursuing external resources but also by exhausting internal resources, which can be compensated by the resources acquired. This process is similar to one of the core mechanisms of the ego depletion theory. An individual's success of performing volitional activities is determined by the resources he/she possesses. The more sufficient the resources, the more likely he/she would succeed. Resources are exhausted temporarily and are replenished in due course (Baumeister et al., 1998) .",

Hence, the education authority should offer guidance to schools at all levels in OT preparation and implementation and provide teachers with resources and platforms for digital learning. School administration and principals should take care of teachers' psychological needs, help resolve OT-related problems, supply intangible resources, such as work autonomy, and establish communities for professional development so as to foster collegial support and enhance self-efficacy (Lee et al., 2011) .",

Mindfulness allows teachers to sustain the effectiveness of online teaching, and it is less likely to lead to emotional exhaustion. The culture of Taiwanese society contains elements of Buddhism (Hwang, 2012) , which is conducive to the promotion of mindfulness. However, past research on mindfulness has shown that it is still effective in different cultural society (e.g., Raphiphatthana and Jose, 2020) .

The fit assessment results were x 2 /df = 2.697; GFI = 0.831; CFI = 0.986; RMSEA = 0.060), indicating overall goodness-of-fit. As can be seen, H1, H2, and H3 are all supported, indicating direct effects of the research variables. That is, JD-OT has significant and negative impact on PIE-OT (H1, \u03b2 = \u22120.23, p < 0.001), JR-OT has significant and positive impact on PIE-OT (H2, \u03b2 = 0.75, p < 0.001), and PIE-OT has significant and negative impact on EE (H3, \u03b2 = \u22120.53, p < 0.001). Moreover, H4a and H4b are both supported, evidenced by the absence of zero in the bootstrap 95% confidence intervals (CI;Shrout and Bolger, 2002), thus revealing significant mediation effects. In other words, PIE-OT mediates the positive relationship of JD-OT with EE (0.12, 95% CI [0.04, 0.16]) and the negative relationship of JR-OT with EE (\u22120.40, 95% CI [\u22120.37, \u22120.21]).",
