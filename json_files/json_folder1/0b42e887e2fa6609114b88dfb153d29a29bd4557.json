While those with microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity (MIAC) represent the highest risk group, this is a condition that is not routinely ruled out since it requires amniocentesis. Identification of low-risk or high-risk cases might allow individualisation of care, that is, reducing overtreatment with corticosteroids and shorten hospital stay in low-risk women, while allowing early antibiotic therapy in those with MIAC. Benefits versus risks of amniocentesis-based predictor models of spontaneous delivery within 7 days and/or MIAC have not been evaluated. Methods and analysis This will be a Spanish randomised, multicentre clinical trial in singleton pregnancies (23.0-34.6 weeks) with PTL, conducted in 13 tertiary centres. The intervention arm will consist in the use of amniocentesis-based predictor models: if low risk, hospital discharge within 24 hours of results with no further medication will be recommended. If high risk, antibiotics will be added to standard management. The control group will be managed according to standard institutional protocols, without performing amniocentesis for this indication. The primary outcome will be total antenatal doses of corticosteroids, and secondary outcomes will be days of maternal stay and the occurrence of clinical chorioamnionitis. A cost analysis will be undertaken. To observe a reduction from 90% to 70% in corticosteroid doses, a reduction in 1 day of hospital stay (SD of 2) and a reduction from 24% to 12% of clinical chorioamnionitis, a total of 340 eligible patients randomised 1 to 1 to each study arm is required (power of 80%, with type I error \u03b1=0.05 and twosided test, considering a dropout rate of 20%). Randomisation will be stratified by gestational age and centre. Ethics and dissemination Prior to receiving approval from the Ethics Committee (HCB/2020/1356) and the INTRODUCTION Spontaneous preterm delivery (sPTD) is the most common complication in human pregnancy, affecting 6.5%-9% of all deliveries. 1 sPTD is the first cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality and the second cause in children under 5 years of age, with the prevalence being Strengths and limitations of this study \u25ba This is the first randomised clinical trial to evaluate whether amniocentesis-based predictive risk models allow optimising antenatal management of preterm labour. \u25ba The study is adequately powered to test the main hypotheses regarding doses of antenatal corticosteroids, maternal length of hospital stay and the occurrence of clinical chorioamnionitis. \u25ba However, we acknowledge that the sample size lacks statistical power to show differences in serious neonatal outcomes.",

            "text": "Open access inversely proportional to gestational age at delivery. sPTD is preceded by threatened preterm labour (PTL) defined as the presence of uterine contractions and shortening of the uterine cervix. Women with PTL are routinely managed with hospital admission, tocolytic medications and corticosteroids to promote fetal lung maturation. However, current routine management strategies fail to distinguish low-risk from high-risk women with sPTD, leading to problems of overtreatment and undertreatment. On one hand, low-risk women are unnecessarily treated. Indeed, only around 10% of pregnant women with clinical PTL deliver within the following 7 days, and 70% will deliver above 37.0 weeks of gestation. 1 While the rates are slightly higher in PTL presenting at or before 34 weeks of gestation, a substantial proportion of women admitted for PTL is still treated with several doses of antenatal corticosteroids, which promote lung maturation. 2 However, the trade-off of this treatment is deleterious neurodevelopmental effects, even in neonates finally delivered near term, and long-term cardiovascular and metabolic effects in infants and adults. 3 4 On the other hand, a proportion of women with PTL at true high risk due to the presence of infection may not be treated timely. One of the aetiologies involved in sPTD is microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity (MIAC), which is often accompanied by intra-amniotic inflammation (IAI). [5] [6] [7] Up to 40% of pregnant women diagnosed with PTL before 32 weeks can have MIAC and/or IAI, 5 and these women have a shorter latency from the onset of symptoms to delivery (median 2 vs 50 days) and an earlier gestational age at delivery (median 27 vs 35 weeks of gestation) compared with those without MIAC and/or IAI. 8 Recent evidence suggests that early antibiotic therapy may reduce perinatal outcomes in PTL with MIAC. 9 However, antibiotics are not routinely used in PTL unless clinical chorioamnionitis is diagnosed.",

Magnesium sulfate will be administered only with suspicion of imminent delivery. After obtaining written informed consent from each woman (online supplemental file 1), the patients will be randomly assigned to one of the two study arms in a 1:1 ratio. Randomisation will be stratified by gestational age (24.0-27.6, 28.0-31.6 and >32.0 weeks of gestation) and centre. The randomisation sequence will be computer-generated and will be implemented using a centralised controlled website randomisation service and electronic data capture system (REDCap V.10.8.2). Neither the investigators nor the trial coordinator will have access to the randomisation sequence: 1. In the intervention arm, the management will be optimised according to amniocentesis-based predictive risk models. High risk of sPTD within 7 days will be defined when the risk is >10%. We decided to select a cut-off with a high detection rate because our management (regarding doses of corticosteroids or maternal hospital stay) will be minimised if the predicted risk is low. High risk of MIAC will be defined when the risk is >20%. We decided to select a cut-off with a low false-positive rate to avoid unnecessary antibiotic administration: -In women classified as low-risk women for sPTD within 7 days or MIAC, hospital discharge within 24 hours of results with no further medication will be recommended. -In women classified as high risk of sPTD within 7 days or MIAC, antibiotics will be added to the standard management: -If high risk of MIAC, with broad-spectrum antibiotics (ampicillin 2 g/6 hours endovenous (ev) + ceftriaxone 1 g/12 hours ev + clarithromycin 500 mg/12 hours oral (vo)). In penicillin allergies: teicoplanin 600 mg/24 hours ev + aztreonam 1 g/8 hours ev + clarithromycin 500 mg/12 hours vo). On confirmation of MIAC and if women have not delivered, treatment will be adjusted according to the virulence of the microorganisms isolated. If the microbiological results are negative, antibiotic treatment will be discontinued. -If there is high risk of delivery within 7 days but low risk of MIAC, the women will be treated with only clarithromycin 500 mg/12 hours vo during 5-7 days. Clarithromycin will be used due to its demonstrated efficacy as anti-inflammatory treatment, since the amniocentesis-based predictive risk model of delivery within 7 days includes the inflammatory marker IL-6. 2. Women in the control group will be managed according to the standard institutional management protocols of each centre, including hospital admission, corticosteroids and tocolysis, without performing amniocentesis for this indication. Despite allocation in the control group, amniocentesis will be performed in cases with suspicion of clinical chorioamnionitis. The same study variables will be collected in both arms. We will collect the baseline characteristics and gestational age at delivery of women who were eligible but were finally not included in the trial.",
