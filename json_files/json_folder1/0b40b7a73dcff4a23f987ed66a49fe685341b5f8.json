LBP has been found as one of the leading causes of years lived with disability [2] and results in high healthcare costs and lost productivity [3, 4] . There are specific and non-specific forms of LBP. Non-specific LBP is identified if there is no known cause and pathology. Most of the patients with LBP are diagnosed as nonspecific LBP. A recent study found a lifetime prevalence of non-specific LBP as being 62.6% [5] . However, patients with non-specific LBP should be considered with subgroups of patients who their outcomes may Open Access *Correspondence: nakhostin@sina.tums.ac.ir Nakhostin Ansari et al. BMC Sports Science, Medicine and Rehabilitation (2022) 14:90 differ in response to interventions [6, 7] . Patients with lumbar spine instability (LSI) are a known subgroup of chronic LBP population [8] . Lumbar spine instability is prevalent in patients with LBP. A study found 57% of patients with LBP had radiographic instability [9] . Clinically, patients with LSI have lost the ability of their spine to maintain the movement patterns under physiological loads [10] . The identification of LBP patients with LSI using valid and reliable tools is essential to apply timely physical therapy interventions to prevent structural damages to spine. Radiographic examination is an objective measure for identifying patients with LSI. However, access to the radiography equipment, time and cost to administer it, and radiation exposure limit its utility for routine use in the clinics [11] . There are numerous clinical tests for use in clinical practice to diagnose the LSI. However, a systematic review to evaluate the clinical tests found limitations in their diagnostic accuracy and validity [12] . Questionnaires are widely used in the clinics and research. Although numerous health related questionnaires have been developed to measure pain and dysfunction in patients with LBP, specific questionnaires particularly for LSI is scarce. Selfreported questionnaires have beneficial for use in the clinics. They do not require specific skills to administer, can be used as adjuncts for diagnosis, can help to measure the treatment effects, and are helpful where there is shortage of equipment.",

The LSIQ has been previously used in the context of clinical investigations and showed acceptable metric characteristics with ability to predict the responses of LBP patients to motor control exercises [14, 15] . A study to evaluate the clinimetric characteristics of LSIQ in 107 patients with chronic non-specific LBP showed adequate test-retest reliability and one-dimensional construct validity [16] . The LSIQ has been culturally adapted into several languages of Thai [17, 18] , Brazilian Portuguese [19] , and Swedish [20] . There is no tool in Persian language to identify patients with LSI. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to culturally adapt the LSIQ into Persian language and evaluate the reliability and validity in patients with chronic non-specific LBP.",

Eligible subjects were invited to click on the study link and view the questionnaires. Before participating in the study, the subjects were given information on the study aims and eligibility criteria. If eligible, they were asked to tick the consent box before being allowed to fill up the questionnaires. If unwilling to participate in the study, they were automatically signed out of the page and thus the process was discontinued. Eligible and willing participants were asked to answer demographic questions including gender, age, and duration of LBP. Patients with LBP were requested to provide the E-mail address, if interested, for test-retest phase of the study. Patients completed the LSIQ-P, Persian Functional Rating Index (FRI) [21] , and the pain numerical rating scale (NRS) for construct validity [24] . We hypothesized a significant moderate correlation between the LSIQ-P and the Persian FRI as well as NRS. For test-retest reliability, the patients completed the LSIQ-P after 7 days. The healthy individuals completed the Persian LSIQ questionnaire only on the test phase of the study. The questionnaires administered via the Internet have been found to be reliable [25] .",

Corrected item-total correlation was used to examine the internal construct validity. The cut-off for Item-total correlation was set at > 0.40 [30, 31] . The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC agreement , twoway random effects model, single measure, and absolute agreement definition) was used to determine the testretest reliability; the values \u2265 0.7 was considered acceptable.

The standard error of measurement (SEM, \u03c3\u221a1-ICC) and the smallest detectable change (SDC, 1.96 \u00d7 \u221a2 \u00d7 SEM) were calculated as absolute reliability measures. Pearson/Spearman correlation coefficients were used to determine the construct validity of the LSIQ by associating it to the FRI and NRS. A priori hypothesis was set with positive and moderate correlations between the LSIQ-P and the comparator instruments. The coefficients were interpreted as low (< 0.3), moderate (0.3-0.6) and high (> 0.6) [23, 33] . The independent t test was used to analyze the discriminant validity with patients with LBP and healthy subjects. Mann Whitney U Test was used to analyze the groups of patients with LBP based on the suggested cut-off score of \u2265 9 on LSIQ [15] . It was assumed that the Persian LSIQ is able to discriminate the patients with a higher LSIQ score from those with low score. A principal component analysis with varimax rotation was applied to analyze the factor structure of the LSIQ-P and to determine the possible components of LSIQ-P. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) of sampling adequacy and the Bartlett's test of sphericity for appropriateness of correlation matrix were calculated. The eigenvalues > 1, the scree plot, and the variance > 10% [34] were applied to determine the number of factors. SPSS software (version 25, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used to analyze the data.",

The corrected item-total correlation in the present study did not exceed the cut-off value of 0.40 [31] for all LSIQ-P items. The corrected item-total correlation to examine the internal structure of a test defines the association between an item with the total score. Low corrected item-total correlation found in this study suggests that the consistency between an item and the other items in the LSIQ-P was not adequate to consider it as a one-dimensional measure. The previous studies with the English LSIQ found Cronbach's alpha which were lower than acceptable boundary value (0.69, [15] ; 0.63, [16] ). Moreover, the alpha for the Swedish version did not reach the recommended threshold (\u03b1 = 0.64, [20] ). Altogether, these findings may indicate that the construct of the LSIQ is not homogenous and is comprised of different latent constructs. The LSIQ, in fact, includes items asking general questions on LBP as well as items on lumbar clinical instability. This implies an uncertainty in unidimensionality of the LSIQ in measuring only the construct of clinical instability. Test-retest reliability for the LSIQ-P total score was excellent (ICC 0.78) [35] . This finding is in line with those reported for the Swedish (ICC = 0.94, [20] ), original English (ICC = 0.84) [16] , and Brazilian-Portuguese (ICC = 0.75) [19] . Test-retest reliability is an important psychometric property of a questionnaire for use in the clinical and research settings as it indicates the questionnaire stability over time. We calculated the ICC agreement for test-retest reliability because it takes the systematic error into account [36] .",

The values of SEM and SDC obtained for an instrument is useful in the clinical context as it will help the clinicians to find out how much changes is real after an intervention beyond the measurement error. The low SEM obtained for the LSIQ-P indicates that it is a reliable as well as sensitive for revealing real changes after treatment. The SDC is a better measure than the SEM as it enables the clinicians to judge whether the changes on the LSIQ-P measured for an individual patient pre and post treatment is real. According to the SDC value of 4.24 calculated for LSIQ-P, a total score at least 5 points is needed to be interpreted as real change.
