In fact, what the authors must mean is that the average knowledge is not the same in all groups that acquire information from different sources. Moreover, was it possible to choose more than one source in the questionnaire? The level of significance should not have been adjusted for multiple comparisons (Bonferroni, for example)? Author response: We understand the issue raised and have addressed the point in the manuscript. The mean knowledge differed across groups that acquired information from different sources, the lowest awareness was among participants who chose family members/friends as one of their source(s) (74.0%), whereas those with the highest awareness acquired their information from lectures as one of their source(s) (p-value<0.001).",

In this sense, the authors should add to the \"introduction\" section the correct answer to each question with the respective scientific references that support this answer. This uncertainty should also be discussed in the \"discussion\" section. Author response: We agree with the reviewer, some answers are unproven, which is why some questions have the correct answer as \"do not know\". Many studies have assessed symptom clusters, transmission pathways, and prevention methods; however, many aspects have yet to be proven. Sexual transmission, horizontal transmission, animal to human transmission, permanent immunity, and fetal abnormalities as a result of maternal infection are unproven. Some questions such as the availability of vaccines have a correct answer of no, as the vaccine was not available at the time of survey distribution. We have also discussed this in the discussion section. ",
