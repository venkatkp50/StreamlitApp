During quarantine, the early quarantined persons on the fifth floor and the late quarantined person in the non-vertically adjacent room on the seventh floor were detected as successively positive for the novel coronal nucleic acid. The index cases and infected case at a different layer had no direct contact before and after entering the hotel and were not the close contacts of the same confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , but the virus gene sequencing results were highly consistent. After investigation, there were no external windows of the rooms they lived in, the air conditioning system of the rooms was a fan coil unit and the central air conditioning air supply system to supply air partly taken from the outdoor and partly from the corridor, the sewage and drainage pipes in bathrooms of the fifth to eighth floor for quarantine did not directly exhaust from the top through the vertical pipes but were gathered to a horizontal pipe at the top of the eighth floor and then exhausted through the roof exhaust fan, which was always closed due to elevator maintenance during the quarantine period.",

            "text": "The WHO pointed out on 30 April 2021: \"The virus can also spread in poorly ventilated and/or crowded indoor settings, where people tend to spend longer periods of time. This is because aerosols can remain suspended in the air or travel farther than conversational distance (this is often called long-range aerosol or long-range airborne transmission).\" During the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, high-risk populations such as close contacts needed home isolation or centralized isolation for a long time. Usually, the isolation sites were multilayer or high-rise buildings and people were more concentrated, so it was very important to explore virus transmission in the building. Previous viral transmissions in high-rise buildings, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) outbreak in Amoy Garden in Hong Kong [1, 2] and SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a high-rise building in Guangzhou [3] and so on, usually took place in vertically distributed rooms on different floors where index cases and infected cases stayed, and the virus was transmitted through vertical sanitary pipelines in the form of aerosol. In addition, viral aerosol can be transmitted from one building to an adjacent building (commonly known as handshake buildings) under a certain airflow layout that was confirmed in a study about SARS-CoV-2 in Guangzhou [4] .",

The hotel building showed a rectangular-ambulatory-plane structure. The early quarantined persons on the 5th floor came from the same family in a community and were distributed in rooms 510, 511, 552, which were relatively close. The possibility of infection before occupancy or personnel contact during occupancy was not excluded.

            "text": "At present, viable novel coronavirus has been detected in both the exhaled air [5] and feces [6, 7] of COVID-19 patients. Therefore, we selected two scenarios to simulate respiration in the bedroom and toilet flushing after defecation and urination in the bathroom for field simulation experiments. During the quarantine period, quarantined persons need to stay in a closed indoor space for a long time so as to generate a relatively large amount of aerosol. Meanwhile, the asymptomatic or COVID-19 case in the incubation period also have diarrhea symptoms [8] , so toilets will be frequently used during the quarantine period. Based on this, two modes of virus excretion lasted for 4 h and 1.5 h (flushing four times), respectively. The fluorescent polystyrene microspheres consistent with the similar aerodynamic characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovirus which did not exist in nature were used as the simulants for field simulation experiments. Fluorescent the three rooms at the same time at 0.5 h, significant peak concentrations were observed at different particle sizes and the background value was restored in about 20 min. The number concentration of particles in different rooms was room 552 > 652 > 752, and fluorescent microspheres were detected in swab samples of the exhaust fans in room 652 and 752. Pouring the simulants to flush again at 1 h, the concentration of particles did not change immediately, and the peak concentration appeared in different rooms at different times (10-30 min) . Fluorescent microspheres were detected in swab samples collected on the floor drain, toilet lid and seat ring, and exhaust fan in the bathroom of room 652. Flushing simultaneously at 1.5 h, fluorescent microspheres were detected on the floor drain, toilet lid and seat ring, air supply outlet of the air conditioning, and fresh air system of room 652, and the exhaust fan and floor drain of room 752. Detailed changes in the particle size spectrum are shown in Figure S1 . ",

The simulated virus aerosol into the bathroom entered the air duct through the exhaust fan. The virus transmission events and field simulation experiments occurred in June, and the outdoor temperature could reach 34 \u2022 C. The open indoor air conditioning led to a lower temperature than the outdoors, so the warm air outdoors would flow down into the air duct. Under a certain wind direction, the air in the air duct can pour into other rooms with the vertical distribution. The positive results of smeared swab samples of exhaust fans in three rooms and the roof exhaust outlet after the experiment confirmed that the simulated aerosol can be transmitted through the exhaust duct.

The fresh air system mixed the fresh air taken from the outside and the polluted air in the corridor to send to the rooms on the same floor and polluted these rooms.

The monitoring and sampling results at different times showed that the simulated aerosol can pollute the fresh air system and be transmitted in the same layer within 1 h of the simulated respiration experiment. The schematic diagram of the transmission in the same layer is shown in Figure 3 . Due to the reconstruction of the sewage and drainage pipes in the fifth to eighth bathroom, the virus aerosol entering the sewage pipe first converged into the horizontal pipe and was then discharged by the exhaust fan at the roof through the riser vents. During quarantine, the exhaust fan of the roof riser has not been turned on; viral aerosol constantly converged in the horizontal pipe and could not be discharged normally. With the change in pressure in the pipe caused by toilet flushing, it would be poured into the sewage and drainage pipe of other floors, and then transmitted to the bathroom through the dry floor drain or washbasin. This hypothesis was confirmed by the positive results of swab samples of the sewage roof riser vents and the floor drain and the toilet seat ring in rooms 652 and 752.",

In the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak in Amoy Garden of Hong Kong in 2003, an on-site investigation indicated that the U-shaped water trap of the sanitary fixture played an important role in the vertical transmission of the different floors [1] . In an outbreak of COVID-19 in vertically aligned flats in a high-rise building, Kang et al. used ethane tracer gas in the bathroom for airflow and dispersion tests and clarified the importance of U-shaped water traps and bathroom ventilation [3] . In two housing blocks in Hong Kong, Wang et al. used SF6 tracer gas to conduct toilet simulation experiments and believed that SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by long-range aerosol through drainage pipes [19] . Li et al. adopted computational fluid dynamics to model the trajectories of aerosol particles during toilet flushing and observed massive upward transport of virus particles [13] . The above studies provided evidence for virus transmission through sanitary pipes from the aspects of field investigation, experiment, and computer simulation, which were consistent with our experimental results. However, in several experimental studies, tracer gas cannot simulate the agglomeration and resuspension of particles, while SARS-CoV-2 was a particle with a diameter of 100 nm [7] which can aggregate or agglomerate under certain humidity, so the results may have some shortcomings. In our experiment, fluorescent polystyrene microspheres consistent with the similar aerodynamic characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovirus were used to investigate the effects of the toilet sewage system and exhaust system on the transmission of virus aerosol, which can better simulate the aerosol transmission characteristics of SARS-CoV-2.",

The usage, ventilation rate, and air exchange rate of the air supply system all affected the transmission of the virus. The N and E genes of SARS-CoV-2 were detected by Nissen et al. 2020 in ventilation vents of a COVID-19 ward in Sweden. The central ventilation HEPA filters were found to be positive for both genes in samples from adjacent wards, indicating that the virus can be transported through the central conditioning system for long-distance transmission [22] . Horve et al. also collected SARS-CoV-2 RNA on air handling units in a healthcare setting, which also showed that the virus may spread through the air conditioning system in the room [23] . Our research proved that the use of air conditioning and air supply systems played a key role in virus transmission through field simulation experiments.",

The results showed that the mixed mode of the fresh air system in the quarantine hotel would mix the polluted air dispersed from the room with the fresh air outside the window and sent it to different rooms on the same floor, resulting in the transmission of simulated aerosols on the same floor. Although the fresh air system had filter devices, the filters that were not often disinfected or replaced not only did not purify the polluted air but also became sources of pollution after running for a certain time. When the novel coronal nucleic acid of quarantined person was detected as positive, caused the infection risk of other persons on the same layer and cross-layer. The investigation and simulation experiments have confirmed that in the case that the fan was not in normal use, the viral aerosol would accumulate in the sewage pipe collected by the horizontal pipe and could not be discharged, which would enter the rooms of different floors through the dry floor drain and the washbasin. In addition, the up-and-down toilet exhaust systems were easy to make the airflow carrying viral aerosols flow into other floors in a specific wind direction, causing vertical cross-layer transmission. The superposition of the toilet sewage and exhaust system and room ventilation system would aggravate the risk of viral aerosol transmission, causing non-vertical cross-layer transmission.",

In epidemic prevention and control, it is very important to find the source of infection that is an index case and cut off the transmission path in time. The confirmation of the index case is closely related to various factors. Even if the sequencing results of the novel coronavirus gene of the infected case are completely consistent with those of the early case, it is necessary to determine a clear transmission path to judge the index case. In addition, nosocomial infection incidents have occurred; other than nonstandard operations of medical staff, some infections were caused by environmental factors. However, the factors in different regions have various kinds of complexity and interfere with each other, so it is difficult to accurately judge by field investigation or computer simulation. In the field simulation experiment, different simulation scenarios can be set according to different influencing factors, and fluorescent polystyrene microspheres consistent with the similar aerodynamic characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovirus can be used to determine the transmission path of the virus and the main influencing factors, so as to provide the basis for the relevant departments to take measures to achieve precise prevention and control, effectively cutting off the source of infection, controlling the spread of the virus.",

The viable virus and its load in aerosols cannot be simulated by fluorescent polystyrene microspheres so the risk of infection cannot be quantitatively predicted; in addition, there was a difference between simulated aerosol amounts and the reality of the confirmed case.

Hotel managers need to conduct an examination of the hotel's environmental risks to eliminate the hidden dangers of drainage pipes, the central air conditioning supply system, and bathroom exhaust system before using as a quarantine hotel. This can be achieved as follows: the air conditioning and ventilation system should adopt the full fresh air mode and turn off the return air to avoid using contaminated air in the corridor to mix with fresh air and supply to the room. The exhaust volume of the bathroom should be greater than the fresh air volume. The exhaust pipes of the bathroom need to be set up independently and cannot be interconnected or connected in series. The riser of the sewage and drainage pipeline of the bathroom should be maintained vertical to exhaust independently and cannot be arbitrarily changed to horizontal pipe assembly. The floor drain in the bathroom should be ensured to have a good water seal. The central air conditioning supply system should be cleaned and disinfected, and its filters should be replaced regularly.",
