However, systems to respond to the range of problems they encounter are lacking. In this study, we describe the impact and enabling environment for integrating a novel Social Service Referral Program within the Inspectional Services Department in Chelsea, MA. To evaluate the first eight months of the program, we used a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative data from 15 referrals and qualitative interviews with six key informants (inspectors, a case manager, and city leadership). The most common services provided to residents referred by inspectors were for fuel, food, and rent assistance; healthcare; hoarding; and homelessness prevention. Half of referred residents were not receiving other social services. Inspectors reported increased work efficiency and reduced psychological burden because of the program. Interviewees described how quality of life improved not only for referred residents but also for the surrounding neighborhood. A simple referral process that made inspectors' jobs easier and a trusted, well-connected service provider funded to carry out the work facilitated the program's uptake and impact. Housing inspectors' encounters with residents present a unique opportunity to expand the public health impact of housing code enforcement.",

Public Health 2021, 18, 12014 2 of 13 problems they encounter: the only action available to them is enforcement through citations. While some housing-related problems are effectively addressed through enforcement alone (e.g., a landlord not providing smoke detectors), others require service provision paired with enforcement (e.g., when poverty leads to deteriorating, unsafe conditions). Pairing code enforcement (an obligation encounter that imposes duties) with service provision (an encounter where assistance is provided) is an opportunity to address root causes of housing-related problems and improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and equity of code enforcement.",

Within housing inspection, collaboration can take the form of compliance assistance (e.g., programs for low-income landlords to remediate lead paint), service provision (e.g., relocation in the event of eviction) or may originate outside of inspection departments. For example, in Boston, MA, through the Breathe Easy at Home program, health professionals make referrals to housing inspectors if they suspect housing conditions are contributing to a child's asthma. Since 2013, the program has helped thousands of renters work with landlords to address housing-related asthma triggers that violate the housing code [14] . Newark, NJ established a task force of city agencies in 2014 to coordinate responses to code violations when the health of residents was at risk. This not only helped facilitate intergovernmental collaboration to solve other problems but provided more streamlined services to residents [15] .",

The agency serves an average of 14,000 low-income individuals and families annually in Chelsea and nearby cities [36] . Their mission is to eradicate root causes of poverty through a range of programs. Typically, clients of CAPIC visit their offices to apply for assistance or engage in one of their programs (after school care, tax preparation, substance use disorder support). Formal collaboration between the Innovation Field Lab and Chelsea City Hall concluded a month after contract initiation, at which time City Hall led the program independently. The contract has been renewed each year since.

When inspectors had a tool beyond citation, they reported that residents received support that not only helped improve housing conditions but also quality of life. When inspectors were able to spend less time on intractable cases, they reported more time for additional housing inspection. When a punitive approach did not fit the problem, inspectors described their pride in helping residents get the care they needed. Though the voice of neighbors and referred residents is missing from this study, inspectors who themselves either live in the community or have spent decades working in the community reported improved quality of life, not only for referred residents, but for entire neighborhoods. Their statements are supported by previous literature on the neighborhood-level impact of helping people meet complex needs and stay housed [38] . As Desmond wrote in the book Evicted, \"A single eviction could destabilize multiple city blocks, not only the block from which a family was evicted but also the block to which it begrudgingly relocated [39] (p. 70).\" The same may be true of other social crises. Two conditions of an enabling environment for the program were identified through the interviews: (1) A simple referral process that made inspectors' jobs easier and (2) a trusted, well connected social service agency, funded to carry out its work. The development of a pilot referral program that preceded the formal program also helped facilitate adoption. The program showed that while housing inspection and social service providers employ very different methods, they ultimately have shared goals-housing stability, safety, health, and social welfare. However, these two groups lacked operational alignment. While their integration was facilitated through the Harvard Kennedy School Innovation Field Lab, connections like these do not require a third party to facilitate. However, role reimagining and adaptive leadership are required to achieve alignment between problems and solutions. The Social Service Referral Program also modified norms around how case managers at CAPIC engage with clients. Home visits through the program mirror the practice of physician house calls, once the primary mode of healthcare delivery in the U.S. Not only do home visits provide services for a population that might not otherwise access services on their own, but they also give providers an entry point to gather important qualitative information on environmental and social factors that can contribute to or help solve problems. The same is true of physician house calls and other home visiting programs (e.g., Nurse Family Partnership, Early Head Start) [40, 41] . Referred residents often received additional services apart from what motivated the initial referral. Half of referred residents were not receiving other forms of assistance at the time of the referral, and for 20%, the referral was their first connection with social assistance. Over half were disabled or elderly. The program delivered services to a segment of the population who was otherwise hard to reach.",

This was both a benefit-because good rapport and candor had been established-but also a limitation. Interviewees may not have felt comfortable critiquing a program the interviewers had helped initiate. To mitigate this, interviewees were encouraged to share their sincere views, both positive and negative and several follow up questions were asked regarding limitations and challenges of the program.",

Through the Social Service Referral Program implemented in Chelsea, MA, when inspectors encounter threats to health and safety that cannot be addressed through code enforcement alone, they have a system to link residents to the services they need. This not only allows for timely and appropriate intervention for residents but improves workflow for inspectors. Given the central role that housing plays in the health of individuals and communities, integrating social services within housing code enforcement is a catalyst to improve community health.
