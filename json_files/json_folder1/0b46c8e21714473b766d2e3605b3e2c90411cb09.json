In considering the value of different basal insulin therapies, although acquisition costs are of increasing importance to budget-constrained healthcare systems, value beyond simple price considerations should be taken into account. Whilst human basal insulins are of lower acquisition cost compared to long-acting insulin analogues, this difference in price has the potential to be offset in terms of total healthcare system value through the ultralong duration of action and low variability in glucose-lowering activity which have been translated into real clinical benefits, in particular a reduced risk of hypoglycaemic events. The maintenance of glycaemic targets and avoidance of hypoglycaemia that have been associated with insulin analogues represent a significant value consideration, beyond price, for the use of basal insulin analogues to manage type 2 diabetes mellitus from the perspective of all stakeholders within the healthcare system, including payers, healthcare professionals, patients and society.",

In the current climate, with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the financial pressures have further increased, and the consequences and costs are likely to be felt for many years. As a result, there are increasing requirements from payers and decision-makers to use resources wisely to get better value from the NHS budget. Consequently, diabetes treatments should be assessed in terms of outcomes and cost across the full cycle of care, including a robust focus on value from the perspective of all stakeholders within the healthcare system. This article is based on previously conducted studies and does not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors. [8, 9] . However, for many individuals diet and exercise alone are not sufficient to maintain glycaemic control and oral antidiabetic drugs (e.g. metformin, sulfonylureas, pioglitazone, acarbose, dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitors, sodium-glucose transport protein 2 inhibitors) and/or injected treatments (glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists) will be required. Over time these therapies can become less effective, which may result in a worsening of glycaemic control for a significant proportion of people [10] [11] [12] . In such circumstances, the addition of insulin therapy to the treatment regimen is required to achieve optimal blood glucose targets [13, 14] . There are many different approaches to insulin initiation; however, in many healthcare systems initiation with a basal insulin is the preferred approach in people with T2DM.",

Initial insulin preparations were from animal sources and although successful as a diabetes treatment, they were associated with side effects such as insulin allergy and lipoatrophy [17] . The development of synthetic and recombinant human insulins provided greater purity as well as reproducibility of response and reduced the risk of insulin allergy and lipoatrophy, although hypoglycaemia remained a common adverse effect [18] . Basal insulin analogues were developed to provide a more physiologic pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic profile with longer duration, less intra-patient variability, less pronounced peak in time-action profiles and decreased hypoglycaemic risk compared with human insulins [19] . Advances in recombinant DNA technology have led to further improvements in insulin pharmacology, with the most recently developed second-generation longer-acting basal insulin analogues having a more stable, ultra-long duration of action enabling oncedaily administration with flexibility of injection time and a further reduction in the risk of hypoglycaemia [20] .",

The annual cost of insulin analogues for the NHS increased from \u00a318.2 million in 2000 to \u00a3305 million in 2009 [21] , and it was estimated that if all dispensations for insulin analogues during this period had used a human insulin alternative, the NHS would have saved an estimated \u00a3625 million [21] . Many healthcare providers do not consider the higher acquisition costs of insulin analogues to correspond to an equivalent extra clinical benefit, and thus promote the switching of analogue to human basal insulin. In the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance for the management of people with T2DM, the use of human basal insulin is recommended as first-line insulin therapy, and long-acting basal analogues are only recommended in certain specific circumstances [22] . There have been suggestions that switching from basal analogue to human insulin therapy may be cost saving. However, even though starting people with T2DM on human insulin, or converting people from insulin analogues, is likely to reduce health expenditure, this may be an over-simplification of the economic value of insulin treatments. When considering the value of insulin, it is important to appreciate the totality of the cost implications associated with insulin therapy in people with T2DM and to include insulin resource use beyond acquisition costs, such as patient education, glucose self-monitoring, productivity costs and potential healthcare service (e.g. general practitioner visits, emergency room visits and hospitalisations). All of these financial considerations need to be set in the context of the health impact of glycaemic control, hypoglycaemia, weight gain and ease of treatment to determine the true value of the insulin treatment.",

Although the change in HbA1c observed in this study is small, and for most individuals would not be clinically significant, it is likely that if the study were to be carried out for longer and/or in a larger group of people this change associated with human insulin could be magnified and may have a detrimental effect on the risk of microvascular events; a number of studies have highlighted an increased risk of complications with increasing HbA1c levels [24] [25] [26] . Modest improvements in glycaemic control have the potential to generate significant reductions in the incidence, and therefore cost, of complications in people with T2DM [27]. It has previously been estimated that implementation of achievable, incremental improvements in glycaemic control, and the associated reduction in complication rates, could result in a significant cost avoidance over 5 years of approximately \u00a3340 million to the UK healthcare system, increasing to \u00a35.5 billion after 25 years of sustained improvement in glycaemic control [28] .",

However, within these studies a consistent finding has been a lower rate of hypoglycaemia, in particular nocturnal hypoglycaemia, as well as quality of life increments in favour of the long-acting insulin analogues [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] . The reduced potential for nocturnal hypoglycaemia with basal insulin analogues represents a particularly important value Fig. 1 Relationship between glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and hypoglycaemia. Blue line: for healthcare professionals, insulin analogues reduce the rates of hypoglycaemia at the target HbA1c level (e.g. 7.5%). Green line: for patients, insulin analogues provide better glycaemic control at an acceptable level of hypoglycaemia (e.g. 6 per year). Figure is informed by a study characterising the frequency of severe and non-severe hypoglycaemia in insulin-treated people with type 2 diabetes mellitis [71] consideration as nocturnal hypoglycaemia is typically associated with the greatest reduction in quality of life and is a major barrier to optimal therapy titration [39] . It may be argued that the differential rate of hypoglycaemia observed between insulin analogues and human insulin could be addressed through patient education strategies and optimised clinical pathways. However, even in a randomised controlled trial setting where clinical management is optimised, there is a persistent advantage with analogues for reduced hypoglycaemia, and this effect is likely to be amplified in a real-world setting.",

A realworld analysis of approximately 4000 patients with diabetes who had a severe hypoglycaemic event reported that in the month following hypoglycaemia patients experienced significantly more frequent and prolonged hospital admissions and outpatient visits compared to the month prior to the hypoglycaemia event [40] . Hypoglycaemia therefore represents a substantial economic burden to healthcare providers, with significant costs associated with severe episodes requiring hospitalisation [41] [42] [43] . Severe hypoglycaemia is often assumed to have a greater economic impact than that of non-severe hypoglycaemia due to the higher costs associated with severe episodes. However, the annual costs of non-severe episodes of hypoglycaemia should not be overlooked. Due to the greater frequency of non-severe hypoglycaemia, it is likely to be associated with a similar or greater economic burden which is not fully appreciated. Furthermore, following a hypoglycaemic event it is recognised that there is an increase in glucose self-monitoring, representing an additional cost consideration associated with hypoglycaemia [44] . It has previously been estimated that the cost of a hypoglycaemic episode to the NHS health system can range from \u00a31.67 for non-severe episodes (cost of using 6.2 extra blood glucose tests after a hypoglycaemic episode) to \u00a32152 for severe episodes (for which the patient is admitted to hospital, requires an ambulance and uses the accident and emergency department), translating to annual costs of \u00a3295.9 million and \u00a3172.1 million for severe and non-severe episodes, respectively [45] .",

As such, these considerations can significantly impact on the value of human insulin. In comparison, insulin analogues have no significant peak activity, a longer duration of action and less variability, which translates into a reduced risk of hypoglycaemia compared to human insulin. This reduced burden of hypoglycaemia will have a positive impact on the value of basal insulin analogue therapy in T2DM from the perspective of less patient fear, improved quality of life, less society cost consequences, better medication adherence and potentially longer-term glucose control with a reduced risk of complications (Fig. 2) .",

It is likely that debate around the economics of insulin analogue use in T2DM will persist. A large, long-term, prospective real-world study evaluating the totality of costs, and value from the entire healthcare system, of people switching to human basal insulin regimens from analogues, as opposed to those continuing insulin analogues, would be very useful in further informing the debate. In any therapy area in routine clinical practice, it is imperative to consider value beyond product acquisition costs alone and to take into account the wider system-based costs. This is particularly exemplified with respect to analogue insulin use in people with T2DM, on which a considerable body of evidence exists to support the value of insulin analogues over the full cycle of care and across the entire healthcare system.",
