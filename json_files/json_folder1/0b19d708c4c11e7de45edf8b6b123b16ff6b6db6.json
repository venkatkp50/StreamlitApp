(which was not certified by peer review) Abstract 1 To allow a return to a pre-COVID-19 lifestyle, virtually every country has initiated a 2 vaccination program to mitigate severe disease burden and control transmission; over 3 3.6 billion vaccine doses have been administered as of July 2021. However, it remains 4 to be seen whether herd immunity will be within reach of these programs, especially 5 as more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge. To address this 6 question, we developed a data-driven model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission for 7 Shanghai, China, a population with low prior immunity from natural infection. We 8 found that extending the vaccination program to individuals aged 3-17 years plays a 9 key role to reach herd immunity for the original SARS-CoV-2 lineages. With a 10 vaccine efficacy 74% against infection, vaccine-induced herd immunity would require 11 coverages of 93% or higher. Herd immunity for new variants, such as Alpha or Delta, 12 can only be achieved with more efficacious vaccines and coverages above 80-90%. A 13 continuation of the current pace of vaccination in China would reach 72% coverage 14 by September 2021; although this program would fail to reach herd immunity it 15 would reduce deaths by 95-100% in case of an outbreak. Efforts should be taken to 16",

            "text": "-wave of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China subsided 21 quickly after the implementation of strict containment measures and travel restrictions 22 starting in March 2020 1 . As of July 21, 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused 23 over 191 million reported cases and 4.1 million deaths globally 2 . The pandemic is far 24 from over, as SARS-CoV-2 has undergone some significant mutations and a number 25 of variants have become widespread due to increased transmissibility and/or immune 26 escape characteristics -e.g., variants Alpha 3-5 , Beta 6 , Gamma 7 , and Delta 8 . After 27 the original COVID-19 wave in early 2020, China has experienced several minor 28 local outbreaks 9 , including one detected in June 2021 in Guangdong Province caused 29 by imported cases of Delta variant from India 10 . To control this pandemic, a large 30 share of the world needs to have immunity to SARS-CoV-2. 31 32 Effective vaccines against COVID-19 represent the most viable option to suppress 33 SARS-CoV-2 transmission globally. The effectiveness of vaccination programs 34 depends on several key factors, including vaccine supply, willingness to receive the 35 vaccine, vaccine efficacy, and the age groups targeted by the vaccination effort. In 36 China, home of about 1.4 billion people (~18% of the world population), 1.5 billion 37 doses have been administered as of July 20, 2021 11 . This figure corresponds to 52.7% 38 of the whole population and 68.6% of the target population (i.e., individuals aged 18 39 years and above). However, it remains to be seen if and when the vaccine coverage 40 may reach a level sufficient to achieve herd immunity. Countries around the globe are 41 facing the same question. reproduction number -the average number of infections generated by a typical 45 infectious individual in a fully susceptible population 12 . For a vaccine with efficacy 46 VE that gives life-long protection, the level of herd immunity required to stop 47 transmission is (1-1/R0)/VE. However, this estimate is an oversimplification of a 48 complex phenomenon as it ignores the heterogeneities of actual human population 49 (e.g., social mixing patterns, age-specific susceptibility to infection) 13,14 as well as of 50 vaccination (e.g., lifelong immunity, sterilizing vaccine). To overcome this limitation, 51 here we integrate contact survey data collected in Shanghai, China 15 as well as 52 official demographic statistics of the Shanghai population, and develop an age-53 structured stochastic model to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission triggered by case 54 importation (Fig.S1 in SI Appendix). We then use this model to evaluate whether herd 55 immunity is achievable or not via mass vaccination and to explore the way forward to 56 achieve suppression of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.57 58",

To explore the 71 contribution of vaccinating children aged 3-17 years to achieving herd immunity, we 72 test two alternative strategies: i) same as strategy 1, but extended to individuals aged 73 3+ years starting from September 1, 2021 (strategy 2); ii) random distribution of 74 vaccines to individuals aged 3+ years since the start of vaccination programs (strategy 75 3).",

Considering the vaccination capacity in China in July 2021, an expansion 258 of vaccination program to the population aged 3 years or more would achieve herd 259 immunity against the original SARS-CoV-2 lineage by September, 2021. However, 260 herd immunity is unlikely to be reached against new variants of concern. If we 261 consider the transmissibility of the Delta variant, herd immunity would require 262 vaccination of 87.5% of the whole population with a highly efficacious vaccine 263 against infection (95% efficacy, which does not exist yet). The adoption of NPIs could explored if and when vaccination-induced herd immunity can be reached in 270 China. Under the hypotheses that the circulating strain has the same transmissibility 271 as historical lineages and that the vaccination campaign will not slow down due to 272 vaccine hesitancy, for a strategy targeting adults first, followed by individuals aged 3-273 17 years (strategy 2), herd immunity could be reached as early as mid-October 2021. 274 However, should the vaccination program target individuals aged 18 years or more 275 only (strategy 1), herd immunity seems to remain an unreachable target given that 276 about 14% of the Chinese population would be excluded from the program (either 277 because of age or other forms of non-eligibility). This finding is consistent with a 278 previous study reporting that herd immunity may only be possible if the vaccination 279 program is extended to children 28 . Nonetheless, it is important to remark that the 280 effectiveness of the vaccination program is impacted both by the natural immunity 281 accumulated in the population (which is close to 0 in China as of July 2021) and the 282 age structure of the population. In fact, in populations with a lower proportion of 283 children, herd immunity may be achievable through vaccination of adults only.",
