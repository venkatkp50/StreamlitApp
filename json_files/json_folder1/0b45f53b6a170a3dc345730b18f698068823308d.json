Inadequate detection and management were closely related to the poor outcomes of AKI patients [3] [4] [5] and were highlighted as a challenge for healthcare systems, particularly in developing countries [6] . In a nationwide, cross-sectional survey of AKI in China [7] , the nonrecognition rate of AKI was up to 74.2 %, and 17.6 % of patients with recognized AKI were given a delayed diagnosis, which was further shown to be an independent risk factor for in-hospital death.",

However, except for effectively changing physician behavior, e-alerts alone did not improve the clinical outcomes of AKI patients [9] [10] [11] [12] . Therefore, care bundles were implemented in conjunction with e-alerts to construct integrated clinical decision support system. The system has been widely implemented in sepsis, mechanical ventilation and central venous catheters usage, with promoted compliance in process of care variables and beneficial clinical outcomes. The system effectively reduced catheter-related bloodstream infection and ventilator-associated pneumonia [13] [14] [15] . Care bundles are defined as a structured set of straight forward and evidence-based practices, treatments and interventions designed to improve the processes of care delivery and ultimately outcomes. Potential elements of AKI care bundles design could be monitoring kidney function, assessment for drugs with renal toxicity, volume assessment and so on [16] . There is a strong rationale for their use in AKI, and the evidence base around clinical decision support system is growing but conflicting. Existing data suggested that the process of care could be improved in various degrees [17, 18] . However, the impact on patient's overall and renal outcomes are inconsistent [18, 19] .",

The average length of stay was 11.9 days (interquartile range, 10.1-16.3). The AKI population was subject to substantial in-hospital mortality or follow-up mortality (22.74 and 27.07 %, respectively). Risk of bias and quality of evidence. All studies had moderate to good quality of reporting (Fig. 2) .",

The study found that clinical decision support system varied in design. Care bundles mostly focus on AKI risk assessment, medication review and adjustment, nephrology consultation, fluid assessment and completion of investigations. In the pooled analysis, the combined intervention significantly improved the clinical outcomes of patients with AKI, including reducing all deaths or inhospital death events. It also improved AKI recognition and corresponding investigations. System usage did not shorten hospital length of stay and reduce the risk of AKI progression or RRT usage. This overview systemically evaluated the effects of ealerts coupled with care bundles and found a clear benefit on the clinical outcomes of patients with AKI. However, e-alerts alone did not improve these outcomes of AKI, including mortality [9, 11, 12] , kidney function, AKI progression [11] and frequency of RRT usage [12] , as well as health service use comprising hospital stay [11] , intensive care unit duration [12] , and total pharmacy or hospital costs [9, 11] . In most studies with ealerts alone, physician behavior improved, such as a shorter time to modification of medications [11] ; more reasonable application of fluid therapy, diuretics or vasopressors [12] ; or earlier detection of AKI [21] (Supplementary Table 1 , [9, 11, 12, [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] ). Only one study in which e-alerts automatically engaged nephrology teams when AKI occurred showed that e-alerts considerably reduced the rate of severe AKI and promoted AKI recovery [27] . Another three studies including care bundles only (Supplementary Table 2 , [35] [36] [37] ) suggest that care bundles can potentially improve the process of care, including AKI recognition, care bundle completion [35] , fluid status assessment, and appropriate investigation and cessation of medications contributing to AKI [36, 37] . These findings, as well as our overview, highlight the importance of e-alerts coupled with care bundles for AKI intervention. Until now, few trials have evaluated the effects of ealerts coupled with care bundles. One enrolled a small sample size and focused on pharmacy surveillancerelated management without reporting patient-centered or medical resource-associated outcomes [17] . Another RCT [18] was a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial, which failed to show benefits on the primary outcome of mortality but significantly reduced the duration of AKI and the length of hospitalization. In spite of robust methodology, incomplete intervention coverage across participating sites might affect the result. In addition, mortality associated with AKI is a complex condition with multiple etiologies or, rather, a kaleidoscope of comorbidities and coexisting acute illness; therefore, it is not the only indicator of primary outcomes. Moreover, the study did provide evidence that a combined intervention can bring benefits such as reductions in both length of hospitalization and duration of AKI, which are also meaningful positive effects of these combined interventions.",

            "text": "This meta-analysis revealed a decrease in in-hospital mortality; nevertheless, the trend was not favorable regarding long-term mortality. Although pooled together, the overall mortality was lowered, and the included studies had a relatively short follow-up period. Long-term mortality associated with AKI is driven by multiple factors, including the effects of comorbidity and coexisting acute illness [18] . In a large cohort study of patients who initially survived hospitalization with AKI, 28 % of patients died in the subsequent year after discharge, and the most common causes of death were cardiovascular disease (28 %) and cancer (28 %) [38] . CKD may lower the threshold for developing AKI. However, the percentage of preexisting CKD is lacking in the included study, where only one study reported that CKD was present in 22.6 % of the enrolled participants (Table 2) . Furthermore, even mild renal dysfunction may predispose patients to CKD, and thus, it increases the risk of subsequent AKI recurrence and ultimately end stage renal disease [39] . In a systematic review of 19 cohort studies, the prevalence of CKD over the next three years after hospital discharge was nearly threefold higher among patients with AKI than among those without AKI [40] . Moreover, a recent large registry study demonstrated an association between CKD and death [41] . However, the included studies rarely reported renal recovery. Our study discovered that the intervention was nonsignificantly associated with lower odds of AKI progression, as once AKI progressed to stage 3 or initiated RRT, it became difficult to halt progression and escalation, which highlighted the importance of the completion of early intervention. In this study, there was no difference observed in RRT usage between groups with or without a clinical decision support system. Possibly due to the reason that patients who undergo RRT have the most severe form of AKI, and the addition of RRT to the ongoing support of critically ill patients would contribute to an increase in complexity and expenditure [26] . Therefore the benefit for starting a critically ill patient on RRT would have to be balanced between addition to bedside workload or resource utilization, and impact on patient's and family's preferences for care [42] . This study is the first systematic review and metaanalysis on the effect of e-alerts in combination with care bundles on outcomes. The study included a large sample size and noted a beneficial outcome. However, several limitations are present. First, there was a lack of RCTs identified and included. Second, the follow-up period among the included studies was relatively short. Only one study [25] with a longer-term follow-up of approximately four years found that a nonsignificantly improved survival appeared immediately, consistent with an effect due to the intervention, yet then attenuated further. Besides, due to the scarcity of data on renal outcomes including RRT usage, progression, duration and recovery of AKI, meta-analysis could not be conducted on the AKI recovery or duration. And this would lead to a result coincided with the findings of the limited studies that had been included. What is more, heterogeneity exits in \"the process of care\" among different studies, especially in \"medication reviews\" and \"fluid assessment\", which was partly related to difference in definitions and assessment methods. Therefore, meta-analysis was not conducted to pool results regarding these two care processes. Finally, as all the included studies were conducted in either the United Kingdom or the United States, the results may not be generalizable to other populations.",
