            "text": "Remdesivir (Fig. 2) is indicated for patients diagnosed of COVID-19 infection from age 12 years and weighing 40 kg or more. It is known that Remdesivir carries risks for hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and other infusion-related reactions, elevated transaminase levels, and has decreased efficacy when combined with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine. Remdesivir is most indicated for moderate to severe and critical COVID-19 infection with SpO2 less than 94%. A loading intravenous dose of 200 mg must be given on the first day advisably in a hospital setting and under medical supervision to avert untoward events. Subsequently, intravenous dose of 100 mg should be given daily up to day 5 and maximum of day 10 depending on the severity of disease [7, 8] . Remdesivir is a phosphonamidite metabolite of a 1 \u2032 -cyano-substituted adenosine nucleotide analogue that competes with ATP for incorporation into the synthesized viral RNA by the corresponding RdRp complex [1] . It gains entry to the cells before being cleaved to its monophosphate form by carboxylesterase 1 or cathepsin A. It is phosphorylated by undescribed kinases to yield its active triphosphate form Remdesivir triphosphate (RDV-TP or GS-443902). Experiments suggest that at i + 4 (corresponding to the position for the incorporation of the fourth nucleotide following RDV-TP incorporation), the 1 \u2032 -cyano group of Remdesivir sterically clashes with Ser-861 of the RdRp, preventing further enzyme translocation and terminating replication at position i + 3. This mechanism of action is essentially identical in SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV [8] .",

The data collected and reported included: study design, location/setting, number of centres, length of study, descriptions of participants including demographic characteristics, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and relevant information on baseline levels of Remdesivir, numbers randomised to each study arm, and numbers examined in each arm. Other key data collected are the number of participants, the form of experimental/ comparator and the specifics of the findings recorded, including the process and timing of the evaluation. Since we anticipated significant clinical and methodological heterogeneity, we narratively summarized the potential effect of Remdesivir on death and recovery by days 14-28. We performed a meta-analysis to pool data on death and recovery by days 14-28 as shown in Tables 2 and 3 and the forest plots (Figs. 4 and 5) . This is the only outcome with relatively well-recorded data from qualifying studies with a low or moderate risk of bias. Heterogeneity was tested using the Chi square-based Q statistic (significant for P < 0.1). The funnel plot and the Egger test were used to screen for small-study effects, a possible source of publication bias (Figures S1, S1a and S1b). Effect size results were based on an unadjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval (CI).

Its broad-spectrum inhibitory actions on coronaviruses have been demonstrated in vivo and in vitro with some success. Till date, it remains the only antiviral drug against COVID-19 that has received full approval for emergency use by FDA [5] . The pharmacodynamic and kinetics of Remdesivir have been well established. The dose is 200 mg stat and 100 mg daily given intravenously for 5-10days. Again, the desired weight of the patient is 40 mg and above. The availability of the drugs is best when given parenterally because of the poor gastrointestinal absorption [16] .",

The reason for this apparent numerical reduction in death among Remdesivir treated patients may be related with the earlier documented clinical responses and advantages of Remdesivir in the 5th day of therapy compared to the standard treatment [9, [12] [13] [14] . Shorter hospital stay has also been established by most RCTs in the Remdesivir group [17] [18] [19] . These two factors could have bestowed some advantages in the Remdesivir managed group, though not significant statistically but worthy of further investigations through well designed RCTs assessing the death rate in severe COVID -19 cases within the first 5 to 10-days.",
