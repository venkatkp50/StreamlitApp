            "text": "A fully functional immune system is a prerequisite to fight against infections and surveil cellular transformations like cancer development. Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs) encompass a heterogeneous group of heritable genetic disorders into which the immune system is partially or fully non-functional [1] . PIDs may culminate in increased susceptibility to infections, autoimmunity, inflammatory organ damage, and malignancy [2] . Initial evidence for linkages between cancer and primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) was first reported in 1958 [3, 4] . Technological intervention in next-generation sequencing made genome analysis possible at a large level and made the PID genetics analysis faster. So far, more than 350 PID-causing genes have been reported [5] . In patients with PID, an enhanced risk of malignancy is reported. There is at least a 1.6-fold greater risk of malignancies in PID patients in comparison to the general population [6] , and lymphomas [7] and skin tumors are the commonest ones [8] . Malignancy is considered as a diagnostic marker in a few PIDs [European Society of Immunodeficiencies (ESID) (https://esid.org (accessed on 26 June 2021))] and is the second leading cause of mortality in PID patients [2] . The information regarding the genetic basis of PIDs and malignancy predisposition is chiefly based on monogenic disorders. A single or similar phenotype will be produced by different genes [9] . Neven et al. (2013) reported molecular and immunophenotypical resemblance between the lymphomas in patients with IL10 and IL10R loss-of-function mutations (responsible for early-onset of inflammatory bowel disease) and germinal center B-cell diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [10] .",

To understand the genetic architecture of genes involved in PID, in the present study, various features of these genes like compositional parameters, expression level, protein indices, relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU), and codon usage bias (CUB), and the effects of various evolutionary forces like selectional, mutational, and compositional ones were calculated along with the determination of their inter-relationship. The study will help in investigating the genetic architecture of the genes common to both PIDs and cancer. Elucidation of genetic architecture in the future might be helpful to obtain a common therapeutic substance addressing both diseases simultaneously. Also, the study will help envisage the evolutionary forces responsible for shaping codon usage.",

GRAVY protein values range between \u22122 and +2, with a positive value indicating a more hydrophobic protein nature, and vice versa [18] . AROMA refers to the frequency of phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan (all aromatic amino acids) in any protein sequence [19] . Both of these indices are indicative of selection pressure [20] . The hydrophobicity index measures a protein's solubility and has roles in protein-protein interactions [21] . The instability index indicates protein stability under both in vivo and in vitro conditions, and values of more than 40 indicate unstable proteins [22] . The aliphatic index (AI) refers to the volume occupied by aliphatic side chains, and with the instability index, AI is another parameter to define the stability of the proteins [23] .

The protein length affects several parameters, including folding enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity [33] . Furthermore, protein stability depends on the chain length and numbers of acidic and basic side chains [34, 35] . Hence, to retain optimum stability, the PID gene protein chain length ranged between 150 and 1500 AAs (Figure 3 ). The abundance of GC3 content is consistent with results obtained by O'Connell et al. (2012), who reported gene expression depended upon the abundance of G and C at the third codon position (GC3) in the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana [36] . Also similar to O'Connell et al. (2012), we observed a significantly high positive correlation between the CAI-59 and GC3 contents (p < 0.0001). The lack of a correlation between CAI-59 and GC2 and GC12 and a positive correlation with GC1 (p < 0.05) cumulatively suggest that at non-neutral positions, the composition plays a minor role in affecting gene expression. The GC components at all positions were inversely correlated with ENc. Hence when the GC3 component increased, CUB also increased [37] . Concerning the CUB and individual codon position, the analysis revealed that CUB was independent of T and G nucleotide compositions at the first codon position (Table 4) .",

Our correlation analysis between the 16 dinucleotide odds ratio and gene expression with CUB revealed that of the two dinucleotides TpA and CpG, which are considered to be under extreme selection pressure, TpA negatively affected protein expression, while CpG did not [26] . It has been shown for the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gag gene that codon optimization resulted in enhancement of CpG rich sequences and had a high level of expression compared to non-optimized sequences [41] . In contrast, CpG dinucleotides are statistically underrepresented in eukaryotes because CpG dinucleotides are often methylated at the fifth position of cytosine and subsequently prone to deamination, resulting in the formation of thymidine out of cytosine [42] . CpG-dense areas are also present in the genome and are mainly confined within or near promoter regions. Furthermore, these CpG-dense regions are protected from CpG methylation through the occupation of the regions by nuclear factors [43] . Bauer et al. (2010) revealed the influence of intragenic CpG content on gene expression by comparing the expression of a GFP reporter in a codon-optimized CpG-depleted version with its CpGrich equivalent [44] . The GFP variant lacking CpG led to reduced GFP reporter expression irrespective of the cell type and promoter used.

Our results indicate the influence of composition on codon usage preference. Furthermore, as we found no effect of the CpG dinucleotide on protein expression (Figure 4) , it is obvious to expect no effect of CpG-containing codons on gene expression. This assumption was partially correct as five codons-CGA, CGT, CCG, TCG, and GCG-did not correlate with either gene expression or CUB, while three codons-CGG, ACG, and CGC-positively correlated with gene expression and negatively correlated with CUB. Moreover, CUB did not correlate with %T1 and %C1 but correlated with nucleotide compositions at other codon positions to varying degrees (p < 0.5 to p < 0.0001) ( Table 4 ).

The CTG codon was overexpressed (overrepresentation, RSCU > 1.6) in 80.95% of genes, underexpressed (underrepresentation, RSCU = 0) in 2.38% of genes, and randomly used (RSCU >0.6 and <1.6) in 16.66% of genes. The CTG codon has been found overexpressed in obesity, housekeeping [45] , and central nervous system genes [46] . In Y-linked genes, the RSCU values indicated overrepresentation of both AGA and CTG codons [47] . In PID genes, all three AGA and CTG codon representation scenarios were observed. In a few PID genes, the AGA codon was highly underrepresented while CTG was overrepresented (17 genes) [ Figure 6a ], while in a few genes, the reverse occurred (one gene with underrepresentation of CTG and overrepresentation of AGA). Some genes showed overrepresentation of both AGA and CTG (Figure 6b ). Runs of AGA codons have been linked to translational regulation by tRNA methyltransferase [48] . Hence, the number of AGA codons utilized appears tightly linked with transitional regulation and selection pressure.",

A faulty immune system with dysregulation in the humoral, cellular, or both arms of the immune system might result in developmental disorders, autoimmunity, inflammatory disorders, recurrent infections, and increased cancer incidence. Initial evidence of the linkage between cancer and PIDs was revealed in 1958, and the genetic basis of PIDs and cancer is based mainly on monogenic disorders. To date, more than 350 genes have been identified as contributing to PIDs. The close association of PIDs and cancer prompted researchers to investigate their common features at the genetic level. In the present study, a panel of 42 genes shared in both PIDs and cancer were investigated for codon usage bias, nucleotide composition, protein properties, and expression profiling to gain in-depth knowledge of these genes.",

TpA negatively correlated with gene expression, while CpG had no impact on gene expression. Regarding CUB, increased CpG resulted in an increase in bias, and the opposite was true for TpA.
