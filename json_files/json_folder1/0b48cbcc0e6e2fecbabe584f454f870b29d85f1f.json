Another group of authors highlighted the failure to include nursing homes in a timely manner in the systematic planning of a response to COVID-19 (O'Neill et al., 2020) . To meet this demand, additional studies on the situation in nursing homes are needed. International organizations have highlighted the need to pay more attention to nursing homes during this pandemic to improve care and education, as well as to conduct more relevant research there.",
