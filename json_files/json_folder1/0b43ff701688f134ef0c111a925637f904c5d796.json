The World Health Organization (WHO) (2016) also stressed that PWDs still experience unequal treatment in many instances including health care services. For example, 'women with disabilities receive less screening for breast and cervical cancer than women without disabilities', and 'Adolescents and adults with disabilities are more likely to be excluded from sex education programmes' (WHO 2016:1) ; this on the continent with the highest HIV infection rate.",

As the researcher in this study focused on the wellness of EWDs, it was also important to consider how their work, the workplace and their growth influence their holistic wellness. According to Hettler and the National Wellness Institute, the effort by a person to achieve whole-person wellness is in line with Maslow's theory on motivation which considers self-actualisation as the optimal level of meeting your needs (Maslow 1943 ; National Wellness Institute 2014).",

Waddell and Aylward (2010) acknowledged that although disability is clearly linked to health, it also has social and psychological components that also play major roles in the wellness of PWDs (Shakespeare, Watson & Alghaib 2017; Waddell & Aylward 2010) . Therefore, as a holistic model, it considers the impact of physical (biological or environmental) and emotional (psycho) factors, as well as the impact of society on PWDs (Waddell & Aylward 2010; Shakespeare et al. 2017) .

Physical wellness covers the body of a human being and its optimum functionality without any hindrance. Furthermore, one can use limbs and perform any duty to one's satisfaction (Hettler 1976) . For EWDs, the physical wellness has some limitations. Emotional wellness demonstrates the way an individual attains adequate fulfilment emotionally. One's effective wellbeing is developed in such a way that one can handle any situation and accept any condition in a mature way. Social wellness demonstrates the ability to interact with other people in a healthy and acceptable way without any antisocial behaviour. Occupational wellness is attained when one's optimum development in any career is self-actualised. In addition, one can demonstrate competency, creativity and resilience in one's career. Spiritual wellness covers the belief system of an individual irrespective of one's affiliation. Spiritual wellness includes the ability to exist with other people with different belief systems, and one can accommodate them because of one's maturity. The sixth wellness dimension is the intellectual wellness that recognises creative abilities in applying knowledge and skills either in academic settings, professional development and community life (Hettler 1976) .",

According to WHO (2016) , PWDs obtain limited education and job-related training because of prejudice and discrimination. This impacts on the intellectual development and wellness of PWDs as well as their occupational wellness. Such a situation also limits their career opportunities that directly impact on their income. This also has a negative impact on the emotional wellness of PWDs as WHO (2016) found that financial and occupational stress result in depression. Depression affects the social and spiritual wellness of people including PWDs and subsequently their physical wellness as depression is seen as the most common secondary disability.

Mining, which is common in Africa, especially in South Africa, increases acid mine-water poisoning. This is found where effluent or liquid waste (waste other than that from kitchens and toilets and produced by industries like the mining industry) flows into rivers and boreholes (Oruko et al. 2020 This programme plans to address the plight of PWDs worldwide to ensure better living conditions, quality of life and opportunities.

Employers will need to ensure that facilities like accessible restrooms are readily available to EWDs or make formal arrangements to ensure that EWDs reach their office safely, especially where alternatives like public transport are not available.
