            "text": "Cancer patients in adolescents and young adults (AYA) generation aged 15-39 years have various psychosocial needs during their treatment course such as school enrollment, finding employment, marriage, and fertility. It is difficult for medical professionals to gain experience related to providing medical care and consultation support to these kinds of AYA generation cancer patients. There is a need to provide information and establish both support and medical care systems that are able to meet the diverse needs unique to this generation. This review will explain how to launch an AYA support team (AST). We have worked and established the AST since 2016, which is medical care teams that provide support according to the life stage of each individual patient and build a multidisciplinary AYA generation patient support system. The team-building process consisted of two main projects: building and enlarging multidisciplinary team and establishing screening process of psychosocial needs of AYA generation patients. Multidisciplinary healthcare professionals got involved in the AST with already-existing patient support functions in our center: the patient support center, which is an outpatient department and the palliative care team, which is an inpatient interdepartmental team. The AST systematically finds patients in need of assistance and offers them support as a multidisciplinary team. The AST also established a procedure that systematically gathers information about the needs of patients by using a screening tool. In addition, the AST provides the following specialized services: reproductive medicine, supporting cancer patients with children, employment support, and peer support. The AST has been established and sophisticatedly worked. It can flexibly provide various psychosocial support services. This review will explain how to launch an AST.",

The types of cancer vary depending on the age group. Between the ages of 15 and 19, there are many rare cancers such as leukemia, lymphoma, sarcoma, and brain tumors. In patients in their 20s, the frequency of these types of cancers decreases, and in patients in their 30s, breast, cervical, and gas-trointestinal cancer become more prevalent ( Table 1) (2) , (3) . The 5-year survival rate for all AYA patients has improved in recent years (4) , and some cancers have 5-year survival rates of greater than 90%, while others have not experienced any change in treatment outcomes (5) .",

            "text": "The periods when psychosocial support is needed can be roughly divided into three: before and during treatment, after treatment (survivorship), and end-of-life. Before and during treatment period, providing information from a long-term perspective such as how treatment will affect the career plan of that AYA patient, types of long-term side effects, and how long will they last are important. Insufficient prior information about treatment may deteriorate treatment adherence and prognosis (9) . In particular, information regarding fertility should be provided as early as possible before starting treatment (10) . In addition, there are many AYA patients who left their jobs because of their diagnosis and are now in financial distress (11) . Medical staff try not to leave out any needs patients might have related to hospital visits or daily life during recuperation. After treatment, for AYA cancer survivors, longterm side effects may persist and there is inadequate information and support regarding how to provide care and psychosocial support for these patients (12) , (13) , (14) , (15) , (16) , (17) , (18) , (19) . Having a survival care plan helps to reduce this shortage of information for post-treatment AYA patients (20) . In addition, since physical and psychological long-term side effects have a great impact on employment (21) , this has to be considered as well. End-of-life stage AYA patients are more likely to receive intensive care and the quality of end-of-life care is low (22) , (23) , (24) . Although it is not easy to discuss end-of-life topics with young people (25) , (26) , patients wish to know their prognosis, use palliative care service, and stay home at end of life (27) . Hence, end-of-life discussion should be started from the time when the patient's general condition is stable, rather than in life-threatening situation; ideally, this should be made by not just the patient themselves but with the input of their family and doctors as well (28) . Programs such as Five Wishes and Voicing My CHOiCES\u2122 are available tools to support the drafting of advance directives for AYA patients (29) .",

While HCPs are highly aware of insurance and financial issues and long-term side effects after treatment, they are not aware of problems related to friendship (31) , employment, education, health behaviors, sexuality (17) , (32) , and social and family issues (33) ; as a result, they do not adequately provide information about these topics. In addition, access to medical resources, especially the elimination of barriers to participation in clinical trials, is an issue that needs to be addressed (34) . Some tools to support these issues are available (35) , (36) , (37) . Some have attempted to use digital tools (38) , (39) , which are suitable for AYA patients, who use social networking services and the internet to collect information (40) . Thus, there are many problems in providing psychosocial supports to AYA patients with cancer. This has been recognized by the Japanese policymakers, and to enrich care for AYA patients was incorporated in the Third Cancer Control Program 2017 (41) . In that program, three policies were described: establishing framework of medical service for AYA patients, aggregating institutions that can provide various psychosocial supports for AYA patients, and developing logistics for giving information and providing reproductive medicine.",
