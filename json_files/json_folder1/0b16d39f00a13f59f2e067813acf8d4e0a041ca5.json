The recurrence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in patients after discharge from hospital signals a risk of transmission from such patients to the community and challenges the current discharge criteria of COVID-19 patients. A wide range of clinical specimens has been used to detect SARS-CoV-2. However, to date, a consensus has not been reached regarding the most appropriate specimens to use for viral RNA detection in assessing COVID-19 patients for discharge. An anal swab sample was proposed as the standard because of prolonged viral detection. In this retrospective longitudinal study of viral RNA detection in 60 confirmed COVID-19 patients, we used saliva, oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal swab (O/N swab) and anal swab procedures from admission to discharge. The conversion times of saliva and anal swab were longer than that of O/N swab. The conversion time of hyper sensitive-CRP was the shortest and correlated with that of CT scanning and viral detection. Some patients were found to be RNA-positive in saliva while RNA-negative in anal swab while the reverse was true in some other patients, which indicated that false negatives were inevitable if only the anal swab is used for evaluating suitability for discharge. These results indicated that double-checking for viral RNA using multiple and diverse specimens was essential, and saliva could be a candidate to supplement anal swabs to reduce false-negative results and facilitate pandemic control.",

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reported as the cause of COVID-19 by China in December 2019 [1, 2] . As of 8 July 2021, about 185 million confirmed cases with more than 4 million deaths from more than 210 countries and territories were reported [3] . Although infections with SARS-CoV and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have higher mortality rates than COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 spreads much more rapidly and has a longer duration of RNA shedding than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV [4] [5] [6] . Additionally, the recurrence of positive SARS CoV-2 PCR has been described in patients after they have been discharged from the hospital [7, 8] , which can further threaten pandemic control. Identifying and isolating infectious individuals by community testing and by testing clinically recovered patients before discharge from the hospital have been critical to contain the spread of the virus.",

A range of clinical specimens has been reported to yield positive detection results, including oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal swab (O/N swab), sputum, saliva, feces and anal swab, of which upper respiratory tract O/N swabs are the most common sample type in diagnosis [10] . However, growing evidence has revealed prolonged positive detection of nucleic acids in anal swabs and anal swab has been proposed as the optimal specimen type for evaluating COVID-19 patients for hospital discharge [11, 12] . However, the duration of detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding differs according to the different types of specimens [13] . For example, a study of 213 Chinese patients, including 205 throat swabs, 490 nasal swabs and 142 sputum samples, found false-negative rates of 40%, 27% and 11% for the throat, nasal and sputum samples, respectively [14] . Prolonged viral shedding accompanied by false-negative results was offered among the possible explanations for the recurrence of positive SARS CoV-2 PCR in patients discharged from hospital after two consecutive negative PCR results. Modified discharge standards, including optimal detection tests for viral RNA, are crucial to decrease the potential transmission revealed by the recurrence of positive PCR in COVID-19 patients.",

During the treatment course in the hospital from 20 March to 12 May 2020, they provided three kinds of specimens: O/N swabs, saliva, anal swabs. Not all of the three kinds of specimens were collected from the first day of hospitalization, but sampling was applied every day once it began and continued until three consecutive negative results were detected after a positive result or until eight consecutive negative results were detected after the first sampling. In summary, 654 saliva samples, 613 O/N swabs and 762 anal swabs were tested ( Figure 1A) . Clinical records of the clinical examination, symptoms and viral RNA tests were retrospectively collected into the analyses. The severity of illness (mild, moderate, severe, critical) was evaluated according to the eighth edition of the Guideline for Diagnosis and Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China [15] . Mild cases include mildly symptomatic with nonpneumonia and moderate cases include pneumonia. Severe disease refers to dyspnoea, respiratory rate \u226530/ min, blood oxygen saturation \u226493%, partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio <300 or lung infiltrates >50% within 24-48 h. 47 (78%) of the patients in this study were classified as moderate cases and the other 13 (22%) patients were mild cases (as recorded in Supplementary Table 2 ). The median age of the patients was 35 and ranged from 19 to 61 years old. Most of the patients (40%) were in the 30-39 years group ( Table 1) .",

Even though WHO removed the requirement of negative RT-PCR results in the latest recommendations for the discharge criteria issued on 27th May 2020, they also encouraged countries to continue testing patients, if they can do so, for systematic data collection that will enhance understanding and better guide decisions about infection prevention and control measures. The recurrence of SARS-CoV-2 after patients had been discharged from hospital with two consecutive negative results has been reported. The occurrence of false-negative assay results is one of the determinants of recurrence, which ranged from 2% to 29% according to a meta-analysis that included 957 hospitalized patients [19] . The cause of false negatives can be in the source of specimens, the sampling procedure, and the sensitivity and specificity of the test kit [7] .

However, prolonged SARS-CoV-2 detection in saliva beyond that in anal swab was observed in 12/60 patients (20% ; Table S2 ), which gives a cause for concern about using the anal swab as a solo standard for discharge. We propose a \"double-check\" using multiple specimens, especially including saliva, as the modified choice in assessing patients for discharge. Saliva testing has been valued because it is suitable for self-collection, which can reduce the strain on the healthcare workers, for example in sample collection and consumption of personal protective equipment [23] . Despite this, controversy remains surrounding the sensitivity of tests of saliva compared with other specimens. Saliva is not a regular sample monitored in clinical treatment and follow-up. Unstandardized collection and processing are inevitable in self-collection, which could make the evaluation of sensitivity unreliable, but this can be corrected during inpatient sampling [24] .",

The sensitivity of saliva was underestimated in this study because of irregular sampling during the first week after admission. There were eight excluded patients in saliva sample data, those who did not provide saliva in the initial 7 days and were consistently negative of viral RNA thereafter. Viral loads are higher in the early days and in consequence false negatives were disproportionately increased in saliva sample data compared to O/N and anal swab sample data.",

First, patients in this cohort were imported from various countries, so the variants might be a potential confounding factor on the viral shedding. Second, the detection window for each patient would be underestimated in this study due to the absence of precise records of the onset of symptoms, even though the relative differences of detection window between the three sample types were not influenced. Sample vacancy of some patients in the initial days brought bias to the sensitivity analyses, which provided underestimates in all the three sample types in this study. The study was limited to a small number of patients, and further longitudinal studies on a larger cohort would help to evaluate our conclusions. Based on our findings here, saliva was complementary to anal swab samples and can increase the reliability of discharge criteria of COVID-19 patients. \"Doublecheck\" with anal swab and saliva would decrease false negatives and help with the control of transmission from re-positive patients to the community.",
