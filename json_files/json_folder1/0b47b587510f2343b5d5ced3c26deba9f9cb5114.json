            "text": "Following the emergence of COVID-19 at the end of 2019, several mathematical models have been developed to study the transmission dynamics of this disease. Many of these models assume homogeneous mixing in the underlying population. However, contact rates and mixing patterns can vary dramatically among individuals depending on their age and activity level. Variation in contact rates among age groups and over time can significantly impact how well a model captures observed trends. To properly model the age-dependent dynamics of COVID-19 and understand the impacts of interventions, it is essential to consider heterogeneity arising from contact rates and mixing patterns. We developed an age-structured model that incorporates time-varying contact rates and population mixing computed from the ongoing BC Mix COVID-19 survey to study transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Using a Bayesian inference framework, we fit four versions of our model to weekly reported cases of COVID-19 in BC, with each version allowing different assumptions of contact rates. We show that in addition to incorporating age-specific contact rates and mixing patterns, timedependent (weekly) contact rates are needed to adequately capture the observed transmission dynamics of COVID-19. Our approach provides a framework for explicitly including empirical contact rates in a transmission model, which removes the need to otherwise model the impact of many non-pharmaceutical interventions. Further, this approach allows projection of future cases based on clear assumptions of age-specific contact rates, as opposed to less tractable assumptions regarding transmission rates.",

It was first detected in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in Several mathematical models have been deployed to study the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. Many of these models assume homogeneous mixing in the population, using the same contact rate and mixing pattern for everyone [3, 31, 60, 8, 49, 42, 9, 35] . These types of models can help to answer broad populationlevel questions, but are not suitable for understanding age-related dynamics. Age-structured models have also been used to study COVID-19, including the impact of social distancing on its spread [40, 56] , the effectiveness of different vaccination strategies [47, 48, 13, 41, 55, 30, 54, 37] , and the effects of herd immunity and re-opening [12, 11, 10, 64, 14, 5] . Although these models incorporate heterogeneity in the contact rates and mixing patterns by age group, they assume fixed contact rate for each age group throughout the epidemic. This can be problematic since NPIs, such as physical distancing, self-isolation, stay-at-home orders, and travel restrictions alter contact and activity levels over time, and these impacts may differ by age group. In order to overcome these limitations, it is necessary to incorporate ongoing population-based measures of contact rates by age group into a transmission modeling approach.",

Unlike other age-structured models used to study COVID-19 dynamics, where contact rate for each age group is fixed throughout the epidemic or adjusted by re-scaling an initial rate, our model uses the near real-time contact rates among age groups to inform transmission dynamics. Using a Bayesian inference framework, we calibrate our model to the weekly reported cases of COVID-19 in BC, starting from September 2020 to the end of January 2021, just as COVID-19 vaccination was beginning in the province. Scaling parameters are estimated by age group to account for the differential impact of contacts on transmission. We considered four different scenarios that allow or exclude variation in contact rates and scaling parameters in our model fitting and show that optimal fits require both the age-specific scaling and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof time-dependent contact rates.",

We have assumed that the transition rates H 1 , H 2 , and \u03b3 are the same for all age groups. The model can easily be extended to have age-specific transition rates. In this case, H 1 , H 2 , and \u03b3 would be vectors with N age elements. Note that . * represent element-wise multiplication. The vector \u03a8 = \u03a6. * K, where K is a vector for the contact rates of the age groups and \u03a6 \u2261 (\u03c6 1 , . . . , \u03c6 Nage ) is a vector whose entries are the scaling parameters for the contact rates. These scaling parameters are used to account for the differential impact of contacts on transmission. They translate self-reported contact rates computed for each age group from the survey data into impacts on transmission that helps to account for aspects such as recall bias, sampling bias, and challenges in defining which contacts actually lead to transmission. In addition, these scaling parameters are used to account for other factors that affect disease transmission such as physical distancing, hand washing, wearing of face mask, e.t.c, which are not explicitly included in our model. The scaling parameters are fixed throughout the epidemic period. We consider a scenario where the contact rate K is fixed throughout the epidemic period and another where it changes from week to week during the epidemic. In addition, a fixed scaling parameter can be used for the entire population; in this case, \u03a6 becomes a scalar. More details about the scaling parameters and the different scenarios can be found in Section 2.3.",

The expression (E 2k + I 1k + I 2k )/P age,k gives the proportion of infectious individuals in the k th age group.

The basic reproduction number R 0 in the SEIR model (2.1) is taken to be the effective reproduction number R 0t in BC at the beginning of September 2020 since the case data considered are from September 2020 to January 2021. The normalization constant C N for R 0t was computed for the two population mixing matrices shown in Figure 3 . For the BC Mix matrix (left panel of Figure 3 ) C N = 35.1027 and for the 2009 matrix (right panel of Figure 3 ) C N = 30.2650. The total population of BC is 5,147,712 [6] . of each age group is implicitly captured by their average weekly contact rates. We computed the average weekly contact rates K and population mixing matrix C from the BC Mix COVID-19 survey [1] . Table 1 provides a description of the model parameters and their values. The population size of BC, stratified by the age groups of our model, is also given in Table 1 . Since the case data considered in our fits start at September 2020, in order to coincide with the beginning of the BC Mix survey, rather than at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in BC, the basic reproduction number R 0 in the model (2.1) is the effective reproduction number R 0t in BC at the beginning of the period (September 2020 -January 2021). We compute the normalization constant C N for the effective reproduction number R 0t using numerical bootstrapping based on the next-generation matrix approach of computing R 0 [18, 62, 38] . To compute C N , we numerically construct the next-generation matrix for (2.1) with the transmission rate \u03b2 as given in (2.2). Observe that (2.2) contains R 0 and the parameter C N , which we want to compute. We set R 0 = 1 and loop over a range of values of C N . For each value of C N , we compute the spectrum of the next-generation matrix and output the value of C N for which the spectral radius of the matrix equals unity as our normalization constant. In other words, our desired normalization constant is the value of C N that returns unity as the dominant eigenvalues of the next-generation matrix of the ODE system (2.1) when the basic reproduction number R 0 = 1 in (2.2). It is important to mention that since the next-generation matrix depends on the contact rates and population mixing patterns, C N also depends on these parameters. C N incorporates the effect of population heterogeneity into the basic reproduction number and the transmission rate \u03b2 (2.2).

Using a seropositivity rate of 4.5% at the start of the study period [15] , we calculated the ascertainment fraction for reported cases to be 0.255 (i.e., 25.50% of all cases were assumed reported), which was then used when fitting to the age specific reported case numbers.",

These parameters are introduced through the average weekly contact rate vector K and the N age \u00d7 N age mixing matrix C, which we compute from the BC-Mix survey [1] . This survey was initiated in September 2020 by the British Columbia Center for Disease Control (BCCDC) as part of ongoing public health surveillance for COVID-19. In the survey, BC residents 18 years of age and older were asked questions related to their daily contacts, response to non-pharmaceutical interventions such as the wearing of face masks and physical distancing, and vaccination. We computed the average weekly contact rate based on survey responses to the question: \"How many people did you have in-person contact with between 5 am yesterday and 5 am today?\", where an in-person contact is defined as either having an in-person two-way conversation with three or more words or physical skin-to-skin contact, e.g. a handshake, hug, kiss, or contact sports (see [1] for more details). For each week from September 2020 to January 2021, contact rates were stratified by the age groups: 18-24 years, 25-34 years, 35-44 years, 45-54 years, 55-64 years, 65-75 years and 75+ years, and then used to compute the average contact made by each age group weekly. These results are presented in Figure 2 (bottom left), where the dots are the computed average contact rates and local polynomial regression lines using the loess method [4] are included to illustrate time trends. Since the BC-Mix survey is only available for individuals 18 years and above, the average weekly contact rates for the age groups < 2 years, 2-5 years, and 6-17 years were fixed at 5.5280, 12.4169, and 13.4486, respectively, throughout the epidemic period of September 2020 -January 2021. We derived these contact rates from the original influenza model of [16] , which was based on empirical contact data from 2009 for the lower mainland of BC.",

Unlike the average contact rates by age group, which we computed weekly, only one mixing matrix was constructed from the survey data based on the total data from September 2020 to January 2021. In Figure 3 , we present the population mixing matrix C derived from the BC-Mix survey (left panel) and, for comparison (and later use in modeling), the corresponding matrix from the 2009 influenza study of [16] (right panel). For convenience, we refer to the mixing matrix derived from the influenza model of [16] as the 2009 matrix, and the one constructed from the BC-Mix survey as BC-Mix matrix. Note that in order to complete the first three columns of the BC-Mix matrix (i.e., for individuals under 18 years of age), we adapted data from the 2009 matrix for age groups < 2 years, 2-5 years, and 6-17 years. We observe a pattern of assortative mixing from the BC-Mix matrix (i.e., contact proportions are higher within age groups than between age groups), although this pattern is not as evident in the 2009 matrix. It is also apparent that children \u2264 5 years of age make a relatively large proportion of their contacts with adults of child-bearing age (25-54 years) and with adolescents 6-17 years of age. This pattern likely reflects family contacts among children, parents and siblings. ",

As a validation step we simulated incidence data from our SEIR model (2.1) using known parameter values and tested our model's ability to recover these values. The resulting posterior distributions were inspected for biases and coverage of the true parameters. All inferences performed in this paper were done using the Variational Bayes (VB) method with the meanfield algorithm implemented in RStan [58, 70] , where the Bayesian model parameters were the initial total disease prevalence in the population and the scaling parameters for the contact rates. Other fixed parameters of the model are given in Table 1 . The VB method was compared to the adaptive Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method No-U-Turn sampling and found to produce comparable estimates of the posterior distribution with significant reduction in total computation time [32] . Although, we set the maximum number of iterations for optimizing the evidence-lower bound (ELBO) in VB to 10,000, the mean and/or median ELBO usually converge in 1000 -3000 iterations of the stochastic gradient ascent algorithm (see [33, 70, 29] for more information about ELBO in the variational Bayes method).",

As an additional model to compare the impact of the contact mixing matrix on the posterior predictive distribution, we constructed each of the above four models using the 2009 survey-derived contact matrix as opposed to the BC-MIX survey-derived contact matrix (see Supplementary material A.3).",

The fits for the remaining age groups are presented in Supplementary material A.1. In the first scenario (SSFR), only a single scaling parameter is estimated across age groups (0.949, 90% CrI: 0.936 -0.964; initial prevalence estimate = 9,827, 90% CrI: 8,455 -11,245) and contact rates for each age group are fixed over time. This model predicts an approximately linear increase in cases over time, which fails to capture the true trends in the data. Similar results are shown for the ASSFR model, which had separate age-specific scaling parameters (see Figure 5 and Table S1 of Supplementary material A.1; initial prevalence estimate = 5,488, 90% CrI: 5,173 -5,806), but still used fixed contact rates for each age group. This scenario again predicts a linear increase in cases, although, in contrast to the SSFR model, the credible intervals of the predictions are narrower and the predicted median incidence crudely approximates the overall trend in the underlying data. Nevertheless, the ASSFR model still fails to capture the dynamic time trends in the case data.",

In these scenarios, our model was able to capture the trends in the reported cases. Due to the single scaling parameter (0.930, 90% CrI: 0.919 -0.940; initial prevalence estimate= 5,039, 90% CrI: 4,430 -5,496), the SSVR model was unable to accurately predict case numbers, even though it captured the temporal trends in the data. It either overestimated or underestimated reported cases with large credible intervals. In contrast, the ASSVR model (initial prevalence estimate= 2,824, 90% CrI: 2,690 -2,959; age-specific scaling parameters provided in Figure 5 and Table S1 of Supplementary material A.1), captured both the trends in reported cases and the case numbers with a higher accuracy compared to the other scenarios. In this scenario, we used age-specific scaling parameters together with time-dependent average weekly contact rates. Of all the four models considered, ASSVR with age-specific scaling parameters and time-dependent contact rates provided the best reconstruction of the reported cases data (fourth row of Figure 4 ). In addition, a comparison of the leave-one-out predictions and standard error for the four models, computed using the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) method [21, 63] , ranked the ASSVR model as having the highest predictive accuracy, followed by ASSFR, SSVR, and then SSFR. A similar ranking was obtained using the widely applicable information criterion (WAIC) method [65, 20] . See Table S2 of Supplementary material A.1 for detailed output of the model comparison. Taken together, these results suggest that the time-dependent weekly contact rates are required to accurately capture the trends in the reported cases, while the age-specific scaling parameters allow the fits to properly match actual numbers of reported cases. Similar results were obtained using the 2009 mixing matrix (right panel of Figure 3 ). ",

Our model builds upon a framework that used age-and activity-structure to study the dynamics of the 2009 H1N1 virus in the Greater Vancouver area of British Columbia, Canada [16] . It divides the population of BC into: susceptible (S), exposed (not infectious E 1 and pre-symptomatic infectious E 2 ), infectious (I 1 and I 2 ) and recovered compartment (R), and stratifies each into ten age groups: < 2 years, 2-5 years, 6-17 years, 18-24 years, 25-34 years, 35-44 years, 45-54 years, 55-64 years, 65-74 years, and 75+ years. Unlike the other age-structured models [47, 48, 13, 12, 11] used to study the dynamics of COVID-19, where the contact rates are fixed throughout the epidemic period, our model uses time-varying weekly contact rates computed directly from ongoing survey data (BC Mix COVID-19 survey (BC-Mix) [1] ). Hence, the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on the activity level of each age group are implicitly captured by the contact rates computed from the survey. Further, we use a population mixing matrix, derived from the same survey data, which specifies the proportion of total contacts of an age group that is made with each of the other age groups.

We show that our framework is robust to population mixing patterns, with similar results found using the current (2020/2021 BC-Mix survey) and previous (2009 influenza mixing survey) mixing matrices. Our use of scaling parameters to translate self-reported contact rates in each age group into impacts on transmission helps to account for aspects of self-reported survey data, such as recall bias and challenges in defining which contacts actually lead to transmission. We considered four different Bayesian models based on the scaling parameters (single scaling parameter vs age-specific scaling) and on the contact rates themselves (fixed contact rates vs time-varying rate). Fixed contact rates for each age group, predicted an approximately linear growth in cases and failed to capture observed trends in the data. With time-varying contact rates, our model captured trends in reported cases, but significantly underor over-estimated the actual values. Only the combination of age-specific scaling parameters and timedependent contact rates provided adequate fits to observed cases data. In addition, the Bayesian model with age-specific scaling parameters and time-varying average weekly contact rates was ranked the most preferred using the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) and the widely applicable information criterion (WAIC) methods. These results show that, beyond incorporating population heterogeneity from contact rates and mixing patterns, it is also essential to use time-varying contact rates and allow age-specific scaling of these rates.",

In contrast, the lower response rates among younger adults (18-34 years) in the BC-Mix survey may have resulted in contact rates (and hence, projections) that were less representative of the true trends. A related limitation of our framework is that it requires one to specify the future weekly contact rates in order to project future cases. One way to approach this issue would be to use contact rates from previous weeks and assume these will be representative of future contact rates. Such projections would be interpreted as a possible scenario if future contact rates remained similar to historical levels. A distinct benefit of our model is that future projections can be made based on clear assumptions about contact rates in the underlying population, as opposed to more challenging assumptions about changes in transmission rates (which could be due to many factors).",

In this study, we used self-reported rates of close contact from the BC-Mix survey which began during September 2020 and is (as of October 2021) still ongoing. By including such contact information, it removes the need to otherwise estimate how contact rates might change over time due to, for example, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as restrictions on gathering sizes, travel, and closure of businesses (e.g., stores, restaurants, etc.",

It is possible to include additional parameters in our model to account for changes in the probability of infection per contact, and this would be an interesting area for further work. In this paper, we take a more general approach and introduce scaling parameters that 'translate' self-reported contact rates into contributions to transmission, by age group to account for possible biases in the survey data. Another limitation to note is that current contact rates for the age groups < 2 years, 2-5 years and 6-17 years were not available (BC-Mix survey respondents must be 18+ years of age) and so were instead derived from the previous influenza model of [16] . These contact rates were computed during 2009 and thus may no longer represent the true pattern of population mixing in BC. Although the scaling parameters for these age groups seems to largely account for any discrepancies, it would be preferable to have current contact rates for all age groups in our model. Lastly, we excluded 12.93% of the reported cases in our line list data from our analysis dues to lack of symptoms onset date. This is a relatively large proportion of the total reported cases. Not applying a correction to the remaining data set used for our analysis can be seen as a limitation of this work.",

For example, we used average provincial contact rates for each age group and did not explore regional differences or variation by socio-economic or occupation group (e.g., essential workers). We are currently developing a variation of this SEIR model that focuses on the meta-population dynamics of transmission within and among health regions of BC. Another interesting extension of this work would be to use time-dependent scaling parameters and mixing matrices. By allowing these parameters and matrices to vary, the model may be better able to capture changes in mixing patterns among age groups and how contact rates translate into impacts on transmission. The impact of certain non-pharmaceutical interventions may vary among age groups, particularly for measures such as closure of schools and businesses; time-varying mixing and scaling would reduce the need to adjust the model fits specifically to reflect the implementation of these measures. Other interesting directions, already under investigation by our team, include incorporating the effect of COVID-19 vaccination and variants of concern (VoCs) in this modeling framework. Certain variants have been shown to be more contagious than the original SAR-CoV-2 virus and responsible for spikes in reported cases during spring/summer of 2021 in many parts of the world. Yet, at the same time, vaccination has substantially reduced transmission in many populations. These factors had negligible impact on the results presented here, given that our data ended January 2021, but are of critical importance when looking at later time periods. Indeed, the effects of VoCs and vaccination may be highly age specific and our modeling framework is thus naturally suited to incorporating these elements.",
