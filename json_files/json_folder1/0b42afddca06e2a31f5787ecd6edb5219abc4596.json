Each child was evaluated for the attainment of a specified goal (like the use of spoon without spilling) at 3 and 6 mo along with Shriners Hospital Upper Extremity Evaluation (SHUEE) testing [7] . SHUEE consists of 16 manual function tasks, which were video-recorded and jointly analyzed to provide a score for spontaneous functional analysis (SFA), dynamic positional analysis (DPA), and grasp/release (GRA).

ORGAN-hand orthosis consists of a universal elbow brace (facilitating anatomical range of motion), a wrist brace (providing external fixation in extension and adjustable forearm wrist angle for supination, pronation, and neutral position), and dynamic finger braces with lock mechanism for each finger to allow movements at metacarpophalangeal, proximal, and distal interphalangeal joints. Tension between the braces is adjustable with the help of individual variable resistance mechanism to achieve desired position for each joint ",

Although the use of ORGAN-hand was associated with some functional improvement, no meaningful change was observed in the child who completed follow-up. However, frequent breakage (probably due to delicate design with multiple hinges in finger brace) affected compliance during the study period since frequent repairing was required. The lack of a comparator control group was also a limitation since it is difficult to interpret whether the observed effect was due to ongoing standard therapy or the orthosis. The current study highlights the difficulties in research on orthoses in CP. Considering the multiple exclusions at screening, appropriate candidate selection is crucial besides customizing the device according to patient needs. Possible solutions to the problem of frequent breakage of orthosis include the use of flexible but sturdy material, modification of design with removal of redundant brace or hinges, etc.",
