At the study site, the randomization list was kept by the Pharmacy Department. An Assigned Site Person was in charge to create the blinded labels for the kits with the volunteer's randomization number and the blinded kits were dispensed by the investigator following the sequential order of the listing. Individual randomization envelopes were kept unopened in a secure place accessible to the investigator team.

The treatment comparisons were carried out by means of the contrasts on the treatment factor by time/visit effect. Treatment effects were estimated by means of Least Square Means (LSM) and their standard error (SE) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Differences between treatments were estimated by differences between LSMs and their standard error (SE) and 95%CI. The same inferential analysis with a previous rank transformation was applied to ordinal variables.",
