In many countries, various measures that have centered on social distancing have been implemented to control the spread of the infection [1, 2] . In Japan, on 7 April 2020, due to the widespread occurrence of COVID-19 in the country, the Japanese government declared a state of emergency in seven prefectures, including the capital area, and then nationwide [3] . To reduce social contact with others, citizens were required to refrain from going out unless necessary. This emergency strategy imposed significant changes in working environments, such as the implementation of telework, as well as in the lifestyles of the workers.",

While the introduction of telework has many advantages including flexibility in time and/or space, and work-life balance [11] , there are also concerns that this type of working style may have negative health effects, such as musculoskeletal pain. Previous studies have reported that neck pain or low back pain became worse among workers who performed telework or distance learning during the COVID-19 pandemic [9, 12] . In addition to the change in working style, the government also encouraged people to refrain from going out unless necessary, which could also have led to a decrease in physical activity [13, 14] and an increase in psychological stress [15, 16] . Many studies have indicated that low levels of physical activity and the presence of psychological problems were significantly associated with pain [17] [18] [19] . These changes in working styles and physical activities, and the increase in psychological stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, may affect pain conditions among workers with pain; however, these associations are still poorly understood.",

Participants were recruited from an internet research agency, hamon Co., Ltd. (Kanagawa, Japan) which had approximately 1.58 million panelists who had voluntarily registered. A questionnaire was distributed via e-mail to 103,556 panelists stratified by sex and age ( Figure 1 ). The questionnaire was displayed to panelists who consented to participate in the study. The questionnaire was designed to be rejected automatically if there were missing data or incomplete responses. The inclusion criteria were (1) aged 20-64 years, and (2) have experienced pain anywhere in their body during the past 4 weeks. The survey was closed when the number of respondents reached 4028, which was determined roughly according to the population distribution (sex and age) in Japan [20] . Of these respondents, we selected the data of workers for the analyses. Workers included part time job workers, temporary workers, and freelance workers as well as regular workers. Individuals who were unemployed, retired, students who were not working, or full-time homemakers were excluded from the study. We further excluded participants who were diagnosed with malignant tumor or rheumatoid arthritis. All protocols in the study were approved by the Institutional Review Board of The University of Tokyo (No. 2019296NI). ",

It can be considered that many companies were semi-forced to suddenly change their ways of working due to the spread of COVID-19, which may have resulted in inadequate work environ-ments such as small workspaces with furniture that was unsuitable for work. A survey in Spain that examined the characteristics of remote workers since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic reported that the home environment, including the work equipment, was not adequate [12] . Working while sitting on sofas or working for long hours on a notebook personal computer (PC) with a relatively small screen is likely to cause/exacerbate musculoskeletal pain. The use of mobile devices including laptop/notebooks or tablets, commonly used by teleworkers, can lead to poor posture, such as neck flexion, compared with the use of desktop PCs [22, 23] . Several studies have indicated that sitting with a poor posture can increase the risk of musculoskeletal disorders such as neck or low back pain [24, 25] . Indeed, we found that the main body areas where the pain worsened were the neck, shoulder, and lower back in the present study. In a previous study with mobile device usage postures, it was indicated that working with a mobile device on one's lap without a desk affected the development of musculoskeletal disorders [26] . Although our study did not obtain information on the work environment among teleworkers, in promoting telework in the future, the perspective of occupational health management including work environment will be required to reduce painful conditions among workers. Companies may need to provide financial support to purchase telework-adapted equipment [27] while utilizing the subsidies established by several ministries and local governments in Japan to prepare optimal teleworking environments.",

The common types of psychological stress included a fear of contracting COVID-19, changes in lifestyles, financial problems, and problems with one's own health. Rogers et al. indicated that, compared to individuals without pain, those with pain reported significantly higher levels of psychological problems while COVID-19 fear and sleep problems were associated with pain intensity [31] . Psychological stress could have led to anxiety or depressive conditions, which may have been involved in pain augmentation. Psychological aspects have been recognized as an important factor in the chronicity of pain from the perspective of a biopsychosocial model [19] . Given that it is well-recognized that pain and psychological problems have a bidirectional relationship, further research is needed to examine the direction of the relationship between the two found in our study.",

            "text": "Our study has several limitations that should be considered. First, the study participants may not be truly representative of the general population in Japan. The sample analyzed in this study included a higher percentage of men (70%) than that in the national statistical data of Japanese workers. In addition, the recruitment of participants in webbased surveys, such as ours, causes concern regarding sampling issues, which have been described previously [32] . Individuals without Internet access could not participate in our survey. Moreover, only workers who were interested in their own health may have tended to respond to our survey. This limited the generalizability of our results. Second, we used unvalidated questionnaires on changes in pain, physical activity, and stress. Moreover, a retrospective assessment of subjective changes in some conditions before and after the pandemic may be associated with recall bias. Hence, further studies using validated questionnaires are needed to verify our findings. Third, the characteristics of companies which introduced telework could not be adequately considered. A company which can introduce the style of telework may be large-scale and occupation-specific, such as those with white collar or desk workers. We performed a sensitivity analysis by limiting the participants in industries with a high percentage of those who carried out teleworking or increased the frequency of telework (information and communications, finance, insurance, real estate, research, education, and manufacturing) ( Table S1 ). The analysis rendered results similar to our main results (Table S2 ). Fourth, our study could not verify the direction of association because of the cross-sectional nature of the study design. For example, it cannot be ruled out that a decrease in physical activity may have resulted from pain augmentation. We expect our study to trigger discussions on pain management in workers. Lastly, the effects of a lack of access to clinics/facilities for pain treatment/management due to the COVID-19 pandemic [33] or general health status were not considered in our analysis, as we did not collect this information in the questionnaire.",

Our findings obtained from the unprecedented situation by the COVID-19 pandemic suggest that pain management considering physical activities, psychological aspects, and working styles may be required in workers with pain.",
