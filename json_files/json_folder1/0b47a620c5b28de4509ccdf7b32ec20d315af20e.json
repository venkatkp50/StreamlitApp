This is, to our knowledge, the first report of ophthalmic findings in newborn babies possibly associated with COVID-19 infection in humans. As it is a new virus, all ocular manifestations in newborns are unknown, and the higher frequency of findings may be due to the multiple comorbidities and weakness in the patients. The mechanism of ocular injury in this study is unknown and may be related to prematurity, hemodynamic compromise, mechanical ventilation, or SARS-CoV2.

All patients showed edema and hemorrhagic conjunctivitis; fundus examinations revealed cotton wool spots and vitreous hemorrhage, and microvascular damage manifested as patchy choroidal filling, peripapillary hyperfluorescence, delayed retinal filling and venous laminar flow, and boxcarring on fluorescein angiography.",
