We are conducting three interconnected, randomized controlled trials (RCT), one for each health goal, within which participants are allocated to an intervention group (interactive online health program) or a control group (noninteractive online health program). The effects of the intervention groups compared to the control groups will be analyzed by multi-level models for change. Participants' data are captured via online questionnaires before the program starts (baseline t0), again when it ends (t1), and later at two follow-up surveys (t2 and t3); the latter 12 months after t1. We are documenting socio-demographic, health-related, and psychological variables as well as usage behavior data of the programs. According to our sample size calculation, we have to enroll 1114 participants in each Losing and Maintaining Weight and Increasing Fitness RCT and 339 participants in the Smoking Cessation RCT. Additionally, 15-20 participants in the interactive smoking-cessation program will be invited to qualitative telephone interviews with the aim to obtain detailed information concerning utilization, compliance, and satisfaction. The online RCTs' inclusion criteria are: adults of each gender regardless of whether they are insured with Techniker health insurance fund. Persons with impairments or pre-existing conditions require a medical assessment as to whether the program is suitable for them. Specific exclusion criteria apply to each program/RCT.",

Study enrollment started on January 1, 2020. Background Consumer habits and working conditions strongly influence each member of society's lifestyle. Smoking, low physical activity and obesity lead to increased individual health risks, e.g., for cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes mellitus, musculoskeletal diseases, etc., putting a very high financial burden on the healthcare system. Recommendations have been made globally and programs developed to support a healthy lifestyle [1] [2] [3] . The earlier a healthy lifestyle is implemented, the less likely one is to suffer from the consequences of tobacco consumption, low physical activity, or obesity. However, lifestyle changes are particularly hard to realize when disease-related burdens are not yet apparent. Moreover, people free of cardiovascular diseases but carrying risks like smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity who initially took statins or antihypertensive drugs decreased physical activity and increased weight, as Korhonen et al. found in their cohort study with > 41,000 participants [4] .",

There are already many commercial and non-commercial online programs to support preventive health behavior, although the variety on offer is immense, as is their quality [5] . Some online programs were tested in randomizedcontrolled trials, but as their content, duration, and possibilities of interactivity differed, the effectiveness varied widely. However, results show that the more individualized and interactive online interventions are aligned, the stronger are their effects [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Nevertheless, we must keep in mind that strong interactivity and close ties to a web-based program may also make participants feel overly obliged, which may cause users to quit the program prematurely. Particular motivational and volitional factors for changing health behavior are therefore very important [14, 15] . The content of an E-Coach, its individual usability and degree of interaction, and its technical functionality and design are playing an important role to encourage user's program adherence and thus a successful change in behavior [14] .",

What effects do the online programs within the three health goals Losing and Maintaining Weight, Increasing Fitness, and Smoking Cessation have on the primary and secondary outcomes variables reported by participants? We assume that we will observe statistically significant improvements with small to medium effect sizes for each program. 2. Will the intervention groups (interactive health programs) in each RCT reveal stronger effects on primary and secondary outcomes in comparison to the control groups (non-interactive health programs)? We will test the hypothesis that the intervention groups' changes in the primary and secondary outcomes are more positive than the control groups'. Our focus is on long-term effects so we will analyze the change between baseline (t0) and 1 year after the intervention finishes (t3), while short-term effects are part of the secondary analyses. We expect small to medium effect sizes from the comparison between these two groups. 3. Does the intensity of use of health programs have an impact on their effects? The hypothesis we test is that study participants who use their health program more frequently and intensively achieve better outcomes than study participants who use the program less often or less intensively. 4. How satisfied with the programs offered are the study participants in the intervention-and control groups? This question will be examined exploratively in secondary analyses.",

Users can get themselves ready for the smoking-cessation date during a preparation phase lasting a maximum 14 days, followed by a 4-week weaning phase.

The covariates differ in type and number between the three coaches. The components X and Z are therefore only placeholders. The covariates considered may represent real-life conditions of participants existing independently of the program; they can be beneficial or detrimental to participants' goal attainment or outcomes. The social environment in particular may be conducive or an obstacle [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . The importance of social and emotional support from people, who are close, is also pointed out by the NICE guideline Behaviour Change: individual approaches [31] . Tiredness and a decrease in drive and activity are indications of mood disorders. Self-efficacy, motivation and intention to change, as well as functional or physical limitations are predictors for behavioral change and associated with mental health, health status, and comorbidities [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . Furthermore, it is likely that additional addictive behaviors and low degree of mental health will make smoking cessation more difficult [33, 41, 42] . Since past behavior predicts future behavior, as confirmed in a meta-analysis [43] , preconditions such as mental health, health status comorbidity, additional addictive behavior, but also social support, assessed at baseline, are considered as programindependent covariates of primary outcomes. We use these covariates, along with sex, age, and primary outcome at baseline to adjust the statistical models in the analyses. In these models, coefficient \u03b3 10 refers to the change over time of the intervention groups (hypothesis 1), while coefficient \u03b3 11 refers to the difference in change between intervention and control group (hypothesis 2).",

In addition, common technical problems on the part of the provider or user can increase dropout rates. For these reasons, individuals interested in the study and its participants are able to contact the participating institutions by phone and/or e-mail to obtain personal advice. Nevertheless, the dropout rate could exceed the estimated 50% rate associated with all online RCTs. Dropouts could occur if participants are dissatisfied with the programs or in case of unpredictable events such as the rapid spread of the coronavirus in Germany since March 2020 and potential problems associated with general high attention, the health of participants, technical problems due to the congestion in the internet, etc. Therefore, we are monitoring the response rates at t1 and, if necessary, will raise the number of participants to be recruited. We closed recruitment on 05 October 2020. As we aimed to assess the groups undergoing additional medical exams separately from those only completing the online questionnaire, the former group's sample size is not included in this calculation 2 As the questionnaire study's outcomes are secondary for this group, our required sample size refers to the medical exam's outcome 3 As physical activity is a key secondary outcome for the Lose Weight group, we have considered both primary and secondary outcomes (physical activity) in determining the required sample size First and foremost, we thank in advance all those who will participate in this study.
