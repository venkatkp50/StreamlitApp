Denote by M the number of patient categories. The overall capacity is M m=1 r m before the reduction and M m=1 r \u2032 m after the reduction. We derive the optimal pause policy by using equation (10) with an additional constraint that M m=1 r \u2032 m = M m=1 r m \u2212 \u03b1. We first analyze the impact of capacity constraints on the loss of patient life months.
