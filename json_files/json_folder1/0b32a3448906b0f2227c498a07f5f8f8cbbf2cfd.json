A similar study in a lower middle-income country also concluded that the majority of medical students are not fully aware of AI [16] . These findings are comparable to the results of our study, in which the majority of students felt that they have limited knowledge about AI principles and applications.",

For example, AI findings are only as good as the input data, and its results may not accurately represent the minority population if the initial input database is skewed toward a certain gender or ethnicity [17] . Furthermore, limitations and ethical concerns related to AI shall also be emphasized so that accurate interpretation of high-quality findings is used for future policy development. Overreliance on AI may lead to automation bias. Hence, sophisticated regulatory oversight and legal frameworks are needed for the sustainable usage of AI in healthcare for physicians and patients [9] . More work needs to be done to create awareness about both the abilities and limitations of AI among medical professionals as found in our analysis.",

However, they also felt that AI will play an integral role in delivering medical services in the future, which may reflect that early teaching about AI in the medical curriculum shall be inculcated to spark an interest in this upcoming field. Several studies had conflicting findings of the perception of medical students about whether AI will replace humans in a medical specialty, here radiology [15, [18] [19] [20] . Although, in our study, the majority of students agree that AI will not replace physicians in the future, it is recommended to pursue positive efforts in spreading awareness about AI so that misinformation and human hesitancy can be reduced.
