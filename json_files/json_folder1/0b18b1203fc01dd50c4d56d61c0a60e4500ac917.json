            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is the causative agent of PED, an enteric disease that causes high mortality rates in piglets. PEDV is an alphacoronavirus that has high genetic diversity. Insights into neutralizing B-cell epitopes of all genetically diverse PEDV strains are of importance, particularly for designing a vaccine that can provide broad protection against PEDV. In this work, we aimed to explore the landscape of linear B-cell epitopes on the spike (S) and membrane (M) proteins of global PEDV strains. All amino acid sequences of the PEDV S and M proteins were retrieved from the NCBI database and grouped. Immunoinformatics-based methods were next developed and used to identify putative linear B-cell epitopes from 14 and 5 consensus sequences generated from distinct groups of the S and M proteins, respectively. ELISA testing predicted peptides with PEDV-positive sera revealed nine novel immunodominant epitopes on the S protein. Importantly, seven of these novel immunodominant epitopes and other subdominant epitopes were demonstrated to be neutralizing epitopes by neutralization-inhibition assay. Our findings unveil important roles of the PEDV S2 subunit in both immune stimulation and virus neutralization. Additionally, our study shows the first time that the M protein is also the target of PEDV neutralization with seven neutralizing epitopes identified. Conservancy profiles of the epitopes are also provided. In this study, we offer immunoinformatics-based methods for linear B-cell epitope identification and a more complete profile of linear B-cell epitopes across the PEDV S and M proteins, which may contribute to the development of a greater next-generation PEDV vaccine as well as peptide-based immunoassays.",

Outbreaks and reemergences of PEDV with high genetic diversity have been reported in many countries (6, 7) . Even though vaccination is an effective method to prevent and control infection, the high genetic variation of PEDV remains one of the challenges in designing an effective PEDV vaccine. Although both B cells and T cells can be elicited by vaccines, it is generally thought that most vaccines confer protection through the induction of B cells to produce neutralizing antibodies (8) . Hence, understanding of antibody responses following PEDV infection in regard to the landscape of immunodominant and neutralizing B-cell epitopes as well as conserved and unique epitopes in distinct strains will facilitate designing a more powerful universal vaccine that can cope with all diverse strains of PEDV.",

The S protein is thus considered the main target for vaccination. Similar to other coronaviruses, the PEDV S protein is a large glycoprotein composed of 1,383 amino acids (based on the classical strain PEDV CV777), and it can be divided into two functional subunits: i) the N-terminal S1 subunit, responsible for receptor binding, and ii) the C-terminal S2 subunit, responsible for membrane fusion (13, 14) . The S1 subunit is comprised of the Nterminal domain (NTD) and the CO-26K equivalent (COE) domain (residues 499-638), which is responsible for receptor binding (13, 15) . The S2 subunit consists of three domains: a large ectodomain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail or endodomain (13, 16) . A large ectodomain is composed of protease cleavage site, fusion peptide (FP), and two heptad repeat (HR1 and HR2) regions, which play important roles in viral and host cell membrane fusion (13, 16, 17) .",

In the M protein, an epitope named M-14 has been identified from the PEDV CH/SHH/06 strain (9) . In the S protein, four linear B-cell epitopes, namely, i) S1D5 with SS2 as a core epitope (22) , ii) S1D6 with SS6 as a core epitope (22) , iii) peptide M (23) , and iv) 2C10, a neutralizing B-cell epitope located at the C-terminus of the S protein (24, 25) , were first identified. More recently, two conformational neutralizing epitopes located in the S1 NTD and COE were identified from truncated S proteins of the PEDV PT strain (12) . Additionally, neutralizing epitopes located at the same region with the S1D5 and S1D6 epitopes were reported (11, 22) . All these epitopes were identified based on experimental methods such as ELISA with truncated proteins, pepscan, and phage display, which are laborious, costly, and time-consuming. Additionally, by using these techniques, B-cell epitope identification can focus only on some regions of the proteins, while a complete profile of B-cell epitope across the entire proteins is of importance for vaccine design and antibody detection.",

Importantly, the immunoinformatics approach can facilitate big data analysis with less cost and time but high output compared with experimental methods. Currently, there are many tools available for in-silico B-cell epitope prediction. Among the epitope prediction resources, the IEDB database provides multiple tools for B-cell epitope prediction with high accuracy (30) . Generally, the peptides predicted by immunoinformatics methods cannot be claimed as epitopes, although they are well characterized as potential B-cell epitopes. Thus, experimental validation is crucial and necessary for confirming whether predicted epitopes are genuine epitopes. Based on this combined method, a complete set of B-cell epitopes across the entire protein can be identified.",

The amino acid sequences of the PEDV S and M available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database were retrieved and a phylogenetic tree was generated. Consensus sequences obtained from each group were then subject to linear B-cell epitope prediction using multiple immunoinformatics tools. We developed our own prediction methods for identifying potential B-cell epitopes based on four known epitopes [S1D5 (SS2), S1D6 (SS6), peptide M, and 2C10]. The predicted peptides were then experimentally validated using ELISA by testing synthetic peptides with PEDV-positive sera. Their potential as a neutralizing epitope was then investigated using neutralizationinhibition assay. Based on this approach, the whole set of neutralizing linear B-cell epitopes as well as immunodominant epitopes across the PEDV S and M protein was identified. 560 and 924 sequences of the M and S proteins were obtained, respectively. The sequences of each protein were next grouped and phylogenetic trees were generated. Sequences of the M protein were classified into 5 groups, while sequences of the S protein were classified into 14 groups ( Figures 1A, C) . The consensus sequence of each group of both proteins was next generated and aligned as shown in Supplementary Figures 1, 2 . Percent similarity among different groups was in the range from 32% to 99.71% for the S protein and from 20.35% to 99.55% for the M protein. The M and S consensus sequences were subsequently aligned with representative sequences of each genotype and subgenotype of PEDV and a phylogenetic tree was generated using the SeaView program. Consensus sequences of groups M1-M4 were clustered in genotype G2 and only consensus sequence of the M5 group was clustered in genotype G1 which is genetically related to CV777 ( Figure 1B) . For the S protein, only the consensus sequences of groups S2 and S14 were clustered in genotype G1, while all the other sequences were clustered in genotype G2 ( Figure 1D ).",

Reactivity of the peptides with their target antibodies was determined based on statistical analysis comparing OD450 value of the F1 and F3 pig sera to that of the control group (p < 0.05). All seven peptides from the M protein showed reactivity with sera from at least one pig strain ( Figure 7A ). Out of 50, 48 peptides of the S protein showed reactivity with the sera from at least one pig strain ( Figure 7C ). Immunodominant and subdominant epitopes were next defined. In reactivity with a particular peptide, if all sera from both F1 and F3 pigs exhibited OD450 value higher than OD450 mean of the control group + 2SD, such peptide was considered an immunodominant epitope. On the other hand, if all sera from both F1 and F3 pigs exhibited OD450 value higher than OD450 mean of the control group + 1SD, such peptide was considered a subdominant epitope. Based on these analyses, the epitopes S1B-1, S1B-2.2, S1B-3, S1B-9.2, S1B-14.2, S1B-19.1, S1B-19.3, S2B-22, S2B-25, S2B-29, and S2B-30.2 on the S protein and the epitope M-2 on the M protein were categorized as immunodominant epitopes, while the epitopes S1B-2, S1B-5, S1B-9.1, S1B-15, S1B-16, S1B-19.2, S2B-21, S2B-24, S2B-26.1, and S2B-32 were categorized as subdominant Table 2 ). Two subdominant epitopes, S1B-15 and S1B-16, are located within the COE domain. Furthermore, we demonstrated that antibody response in the sera with high neutralizing titer (NT \u2265 64) and low neutralizing titer (NT = 32) against some epitopes was significantly different (p < 0.05) as indicated in Figures 7A, C . This information may suggest the correlation between antibodies targeting these epitopes and neutralizing activity of the serum. Based on the B-cell epitopes we identified in the present study, some have already been reported. The epitope S1B-19 (aa. 719-772) is a part of the S1D domain (aa. 636-789) containing neutralizing epitopes (34) . The S1B-19.1 epitope (aa. 719-730) overlaps with the known epitope S1D SE16 (722-SSTFNSTREL-731) (33) , while the S1B-19.3 epitope (aa. 748-772) consists of two known epitopes, SS2 (22) and SS6 (22) . The S1B-8 epitope (aa. 203-211) corresponds to the known epitope, peptide M (23), while the epitope S2B-33 (aa. 1,345-1,379) contains the 2C10 epitope (25) . The epitope S1B-14.1 (aa. 457-477) entirely maps in the neutralizing epitope (aa. 432-481) (12) .

            "text": "Neutralization ability of the antibodies against each epitope were further tested using neutralization-inhibition assay as shown in the schematic representation in Figure 8A . The assay was conducted with serially diluted serum and 100 TCID 50 of PEDV. Neutralization inhibition mediated by a peptide was determined at the endpoint neutralizing antibody titer, at which the amount of antibodies is only sufficient to neutralize the virus and depletion of neutralizing antibodies will result in the loss of the neutralization potential of the serum. Four sera including F1 1-3, F1 1-4, F1 1-5, and F3 1-10 were used in the assay. Peptides corresponding to the known epitopes SS2, SS6, and 2C10 were used as references, and irrelevant peptides N (MHC) and E(CTL) were included as negative controls. All three reference peptides exhibited their ability to inhibit the neutralizing activity of the sera, while irrelevant peptides did not ( Figure 8B) . Notably, peptides from the M protein were tested with only two sera, F1 1-4 and Figure 8B, Supplementary Figures 7, 8) . A combined result from both sera suggested that all seven epitopes of the M protein had the potential to be neutralizing epitopes. However, the three M peptides, namely, M-1, M-2, and M-6, could inhibit the neutralizing activity of both sera tested, suggesting them to be the most promising targets in the M protein for virus neutralization. Linear B-cell epitopes were identified following the three prediction methods described in Figure 2 . Peptides resulting from the prediction of all 14 groups of the S protein were aligned and the peptides selected for further experimental evaluation are indicated in the \"selected epitope\" line with the designated name. In the presence of the S peptides, four pig sera showed different patterns of neutralization inhibition as summarized in Table 2 , Supplementary Figures 6-9 . In Figure 8B , neutralizing epitopes were concluded based on the combined results of all four sera. The peptide that inhibited the neutralizing activity of at least one serum was considered a neutralizing epitope. Almost all peptides, except S1B-7, S1B-11, S1B-14.2, S1B-19.1, S1B-19.2, and S2B-22, could inhibit the neutralizing activity of at least one serum. Hence, epitopes S1B-1, S1B-2.2, S1B-3, S1B-9.2, S1B-19.3, S2B-25, S2B-29, and S2B-30.2 posed as both neutralizing and immunodominant epitopes. Importantly, antibodies recognizing the three epitopes in the COE domain, which are S1B-15, S1B-16, and S1B-17, were demonstrated with neutralization ability. Among the peptides capable of inhibiting the neutralizing activity of the serum, peptides S1B1, S1B-2.2, S1B-5, S2B-26.1, S2B-27, S2B-29, S2B-30, and S2B-33 showed neutralization inhibition in all sera tested, strongly confirming them as promising targets for PEDV neutralization. While most of the former epitope identifications focus on the S1 subunit, our work demonstrates that the S2 subunit indeed harbors multiple immunodominant as well as neutralizing epitopes, representing targets for both vaccine development and antibody detection. Figure 9A , most of the epitopes are exposed on the surface, by which surface accessibility is one main feature associated with Bcell epitopes. Although coil is generally recognized as one main characteristic of the linear B-cell epitopes, B-cell epitopes identified in our study were found to be composed of various structures including coil, alpha helix, and beta sheet ( Figure 9B ). However, close-ups of the immunodominant epitopes and neutralizing epitopes in the COE revealed that these epitopes are either partly or entirely composed of coil structure and some epitopes also consist of other structures either alpha helix or beta sheet ( Figures 9C, D) . Close-ups and the secondary structure of all the other epitopes are shown in Supplementary Figure 10 .",

Identification of neutralizing B-cell epitopes that are conserved across all diverse PEDV strains will contribute to the development of a more effective universal vaccine to combat all diverse strains of PEDV. So far, eight B-cell epitopes have been identified from five regions of the PEDV S protein. With the aim to identify B-cell epitopes from diverse strains of PEDV, immunoinformatics approach allows us to primarily screen for candidate B-cell epitopes from a large number of sequences retrieved from the database. By using multiple prediction tools, none of these prediction tools gave the prediction result that covers all four known epitopes [peptide M (23), SS2 (22) , SS6 (22) , and 2C10 (25)] when they were used alone. Our work is in agreement with the previous study showing that prediction using two or more tools increased both accuracy and probability in defining a genuine B-cell epitope (36) . Thus, we developed our own prediction methods combining multiple immunoinformatics tools to predict and identify peptides with high potential as B-cell epitopes. Our immunoinformatics methods allowed us to identify important Bcell epitopes from diverse sequences of PEDV. Moreover, we have employed the prediction methods developed in this study in identifying B-cell epitopes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (37), and we have proven that our immunoinformatics-based method is potent and useful in facilitating the identification of immunodominant epitopes with less time and cost compared with conventional methods.",

Pig sera with PEDV-neutralizing activity were screened by neutralization assay with CV777 lineage virus (ACC_PEDV). Both PEDV genotypes (G1 and G2) were found and reported to be the cause of several PEDV outbreaks in Thailand in the past recent years (7, 38) ; therefore, the pig sera we collected from different farms may be varied in terms of PEDV strain specificity. However, by using our CV777 lineage PEDV, we were able to measure the neutralization potential of the pig serum samples. This neutralizing activity is possibly mediated by antibodies recognizing conserved epitopes on the PEDV S protein. ELISA test confirmed the reactivity of the predicted peptides with PEDV-positive sera. However, the patterns of antibody responses in two different pig strains, F1 and F3, were different with some peptides. This may be influenced by several factors such as pig genetic background, age, duration, and dose of infection. Moreover, it is also possible that the infection in each farm is caused by different PEDV strains as different genotypes and subgenotypes of PEDV were reported in different regions of Thailand (7, 38) .",

Interestingly, although PEDV (alphacoronavirus) and SARS-CoV-2 (betacoronavirus) belong to different genus, the landscape of immunodominant epitopes on the S protein of these two coronaviruses remarkably resembles. The following epitopes including i) S1B-1, ii) S1B-19 (19. 1 and 19.3) , iii) S2B-22, and iv) S2B-29 and S2B-30.2 are located at the following regions: i) the N-terminus next to the signal sequence; ii) CTD, upstream region of the S1/S2 cleavage site; iii) FP region; and iv) upstream region of the HR2, respectively, which have also been indicated to be the main sites of immunodominant epitopes on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein recently reported by our group (37) and Li et al. (39) . Moreover, the epitopes S1B-15, S1B-16, and S1B-17, which are located within the COE domain, also mirror A B D C FIGURE 7 | Antibody responses against predicted epitopes and landscapes of the immunodominant B-cell epitopes. (A, C) Antibody responses against predicted B-cell epitopes of the M and S proteins, respectively. ELISA was performed with PEDV-positive F1 (12 samples) and F3 (11 samples) pig sera whose neutralizing activity against PEDV had been confirmed. Sera from uninfected F3 pigs were used as a control. ELISA plates were coated with synthetic peptides corresponding to the predicted epitopes as indicated in the X-axis. Serum was diluted 1:50 and used in ELISA. The optical density at the wavelength of 450 nm was measured. Antibody response of the serum samples with neutralizing antibody titer (NT) \u226564 is shown in yellow circle. Non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test was used in statistical analysis. The significant difference of the infected F1 group vs control group and infected F3 group vs control group is indicated with * (red asterisk) indicates p <0.05 but >0.001; * (black asterisk) indicates p <0.001, # indicates a significant difference between sera with NT \u226564 and NT = 32 in reactivity with the same peptide. Immunodominant and subdominant epitopes were defined as follows. In reactivity with a particular peptide, if i) all sera from both F1 and F3 pigs exhibited OD450 value higher than OD450 mean of the control group + 2SD and ii) all sera from both F1 and F3 pigs exhibited OD450 value higher than OD450 mean of the control group + 1SD, such peptide was considered an i) immunodominant and ii) subdominant epitope, respectively. Immunodominant and subdominant are highlighted with yellow and blue box, respectively. the three most dominant epitopes within the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD identified in our previous work (37) . Additionally, the Cterminal endodomain of the S protein is another main site accommodating an immunodominant B-cell epitope of SARS-CoV-2 (37, (39) (40) (41) as well as the neutralizing epitope 2C10 with the GPRLQPY motif (epitope S2B-33 in this study) of PEDV (25) . The neutralizing activity of the antibodies targeting these novel epitopes was addressed using neutralization-inhibition assay, by which the target antibodies are depleted/blocked with their cognate peptides. This technique has been previously used to identify neutralizing epitopes from SARS-CoV-2 (40) and coxsackievirus A16, a causative agent of HFMD (human, foot, hand and mouth disease) (42) . However, we observed that the inhibitory effect of a peptide on different sera was different for some peptides. This may be because of the varied levels of antibodies against each epitope in different sera. Surprisingly, we did not see the inhibitory effect of three immunodominant epitopes, S1B-14.2, S1B-19.1, and S2B-22, on any sera. This result can be explained by two possibilities: i) these epitopes are indeed non-neutralizing epitopes recognized by nonneutralizing antibodies, and ii) the peptides cannot compete with the epitope present on the virus particle, which is perhaps more complete than the peptide in terms of amino acid composition and conformation, in binding to their cognate antibodies; thus, the neutralizing activity of the serum is maintained.",

The neutralizing epitope S1B-10 is located at the S1 region that plays an important role in PEDV attachment to the host cell using sugar-binding activity (45) . Moreover, the neutralizing epitope S1B 14.1 overlaps with the C-terminal sequence of the conformational epitope (aa. 435-485) formerly identified in the PEDV PT strain (12) , suggesting that the overlapping sequence (457-RILYCDDPVSQLKCSQVAFDL-477) may function as a core neutralizing epitope in that region. The S1D domain located in the S1 CTD, which also includes our neutralizing epitope S1B-19, is well documented as an immunodominant epitope/domain and a target of neutralizing antibodies (11, 22, 35) . Within the COE domain, three neutralizing epitopes (S1B-15, S1B-16, and S1B-17) identified in our study may be the main targets for neutralizing antibody recognition in the neutralizing conformational epitope (aa. 575-639) previously identified by Chang et al. (12) . Generally, a conformational epitope requires correct conformation to interact with its target antibody; however, we demonstrate here that short linear peptides within the long conformational epitope can also be recognized by antibodies and binding of these short linear peptides to the antibody is sufficient to interfere the neutralizing activity of the antibody. On the other hand, it is also possible that the linear epitopes we identified are functionally complete as an epitope. This hypothesis is supported by one of our studies showing that epitope S1B-17 is immunodominant and elicited neutralizing antibody in mice immunized with PEDV COE (unpublished work). Moreover, epitopes identified with continuous sequence and thought to be a linear epitope may actually function in the form of conformational epitope as shown by Chang et al. (12) and one of our immunodominant linear epitopes, S1B-9.2, by which only non-denatured peptide but not the denatured one could bind to the antibody (data not shown).",

In this study, in addition to the 2C10 epitope, more neutralizing B-cell epitopes in the S2 subunit were identified. The neutralizing epitope S2B-20 is located next to the S1/S2 cleavage site; thus, antibody binding to this region may interfere S1/S2 cleavage, resulting in a loss of viral infectivity. The coronavirus S2 subunit consists of fusion peptide (FP) and heptad repeat regions (HR) that play important roles in cell membrane fusion (46) . In a betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, the epitopes located in the FP and HR2 regions have been identified as immunodominant and neutralizing epitope (47) . In our study, the neutralizing epitopes S2B-21 and S2B-23 map in the FP, a region responsible for protease cleavage and membrane fusion (44) ; thus, antibody binding to this region could affect these processes during viral cell entry. The neutralizing epitopes S2B-24, 25, and 26 are located within the HR1 region, whereas neutralizing epitopes S2B-27, 28, 29, 30, and 31 are located in the upstream region of the HR2 and S2B-32 is located within the HR2. The HR1 and HR2 domains of coronaviruses play important roles in membrane fusion (44) ; thus, blocking these regions with antibodies may result in inhibition of the membrane fusion process.",

Based on neutralizationinhibition assay, epitopes M-1, M-2, and M-6 are the most promising as evidenced by the loss of neutralizing ability of both tested sera in the presence of these three peptides. The neutralization potential of antibodies against coronavirus M protein has been previously reported in the study of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a PEDV closely related alphacoronavirus, that the antibodies against the TGEV membrane protein had neutralizing activity in the presence of complement (48) . Together with the profile of B-cell epitope within the M protein, our study shows for the first time that antibodies targeting the M protein could mediate PEDV neutralization. This new finding suggests that the nextgeneration PEDV vaccine may need to include either epitopes or the entire M protein in the vaccine design. Epitopes in the M protein are generally more conserved than those in the S protein; they thus have a potential use in the development of a detection kit.",

Firstly, linear B-cell epitope prediction was performed using BepiPred-2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/BepiPred/), which predicts linear B-cell epitopes from a protein sequence, using a random forest algorithm trained on epitopes and non-epitope amino acids determined from crystal structures, followed by performing sequential prediction smoothing (51) . In our study, the residues with the threshold score of epitope probability above 0.5 were considered as parts of a B-cell epitope. Putative B-cell epitopes were selected based on the region with at least six consecutive residues predicted to have epitope probability above 0.5. Notably, BepiPred-2.0 also predicts and provides accessibility and coil probability of each amino acid residue. In addition, other properties of the proteins were also characterized using multiple immunoinformatics tools provided by IEDB (http:// tools.iedb.org/bcell/), except IUPred. IUPred (https://iupred.elte. hu/) was used to predict intrinsically unstructured proteins which infers to coil probability (52) . The method of Emini (53) was used to predict surface accessibility, while the method of Kolaskar and Tongaonkar, the semi-empirical method (54) , was used to predict antigenicity determinant. Hydrophilicity of the protein was predicted using the method of Parker. The results of prediction from each method were aligned and three methods for identifying and selecting candidate B-cell epitopes were created based on the four known B-cell epitopes derived from PEDV protein as described in the result part.",

Following an incubation at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 .for 3 h, the virus suspension was removed from the well and a new medium was added into the wells. In addition, the conditions that the Vero cells were incubated with i) medium alone, ii) serum alone, iii) PEDV alone, and iv) the mixture of PEDV and serum were also included in the assay as control conditions. All conditions were performed in duplicate. Following a 3-day (F1 1-4 and F1 1-5) or 5-day (F1 1-3 and F3 1-10) incubation, PEDV infection in Vero cell was investigated using immunofluorescence staining assay. Neutralization inhibition mediated by a peptide was determined at the endpoint neutralizing antibody titer.",
