To elucidate the current status in Japan, we analyzed totally 2,000 sera in August (n = 1,000) and December (n = 1,000) 2021 collected from individuals who underwent a health check-up. The anti-N seropositive rate were 2.1% and 3.9% in August and December 2021, respectively, demonstrating a Delta variant endemic during that time; it was approximately twofold higher than the rate based on the PCR-based diagnosis. The anti-S seropositive rate was 38.7% in August and it reached 90.8% in December, in concordance with the vaccination rate in Japan. In the December cohort, 78.7% of the sera showed neutralizing activity against the Delta variant, whereas that against the Omicron was much lower at 36.6%. These analyses revealed that effective immunity against the Delta variant was established in December 2021, however, prompt three-dose vaccination is needed to overcome Omicron's outbreak.",

One of the most important factors is the appearance of the continuous SARS-CoV-2 variants replacing the original variant. In Japan, the Alpha variant (B. 1 from July to August 2021(it was called the 5th wave in Japan, S1 Fig) [1] [2] [3] . The Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) was first reported in South Africa in November 2021 [4] and has spread worldwide [5] including UK and U.S. (new Omicron infections: >200,000/day in the UK [5] and >1,000,000 Omicron cases per day in the U.S. [6]), and it was expected to invade Japan at the end of 2021. Actually, the spread of Omicron variant has caused largest increase of COVID-19 cases in Japan as of February 2022 (S1 Fig) [1] . The other critical event in the pandemic has been the launch of COVID-19 vaccines. The accelerated development of several vaccine platforms was based on the components of the original SARS-CoV-2 strain as the template, and these vaccines have been demonstrated to be effective for reducing the COVID-19 outbreak [7, 8] . The BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine (Comirnaty 1 , BioNTech-Pfizer, Mainz, Germany/New York, USA) [9] was approved first in Japan and administered to healthcare workers starting in February 2021, then to individuals aged \ufffd65 old beginning in April 2021, expanding to other populations from May 2021. The mRNA vaccines developed by Moderna [10] were also approved in Japan and have been widely used since May 2021. These vaccines induce immunity against the S antigen, and vaccines based on inactivated virus which include a variety of antigens are not used in Japan. The number of vaccinated individuals in Japan is increasing rapidly, as monitored by the government system [11] ; as of December 2021, approx. 74% of the population has received two doses of a vaccine. A three-dose vaccination policy for medical staff was initiated in December 2021, and optional booster vaccination for all adults (\ufffd18 years old) who got the 2nd vaccination over 8 months before has been started in Japan [12] .",

Our present surveillance in Japan's Hyogo prefecture revealed that the anti-N-positive rate, which represents the SARS--CoV-2 infection rate, was 2.1% in the August 2021 cohort and 3.9% in the December 2021 cohort. In our October 2020 serosurveillance [18] , the anti-N-positive rate by the same ECLIA method for 1,000 sera from the same Hyogo Prefecture Health Promotion Association clinics was 0.4%. The increase in the anti-N-positive rate in Hyogo prefecture was well synchronized with the cumulative number of the COVID-19 cases based on PCR results (S3 Fig). The increased rate of anti-N seroprevalence was 0.17% per month from October 2020 to August 2021 and 0.45% per month from August 2021 to December 2021. The steep increase during the latter period is accounted for by the spread of the Delta variant in Japan's so-called '5th wave' (S1 Fig). Serosurveillance by Japanese government at the five areas in Japan, that is Tokyo, Osaka, Miyagi, Aichi, and Fukuoka, during 14-25 th , 2020 also used the Roche ECLIA as our study, in combination with Abbott chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) (available from: https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/000734482.pdf, Japanese). The result calculated for the ECLIA only to compare with our data was well consistent with our surveillance (S3 Fig) at that time point, although we need to wait for the next surveillance to compare with our data obtained before and after the 5 th wave. We suspected that the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate estimated by the seroprevalence of anti-N antibody would be higher than the rate indicated by the PCR-based diagnoses due to the existence of asymptomatically or mildly infected individuals whose cases may not have been detected since they never underwent testing by PCR analysis or antigen test. The anti-N ECLIA used here is a high sensitivity method widely detecting IgG, IgA, and IgM, it has advantage for the use of serosurveillance [26] . Indeed, the anti-N ECLIA-based infection rates revealed in the present analyses, i.e., 2.1% and 3.9% for August and December 2021, were respectively higher than the rates 0.84% (46,381 cases/5,465 thousand people in Hyogo prefecture as of August 6, 2021) and 1.4% (78,898 cases/5,465 thousand people in Hyogo prefecture as of December 8, 2021) estimated from the reported cases based on PCR diagnoses [1] . The fold difference was nearly constant for both periods, reflecting the synchronized increases in the anti-N-positive rate and the reported cases (S3 Fig), i.e., 2.5-to 2.6-fold lower for the PCRbased estimation.",

Since the infection rate are not equal for each age group (S4 Table) , we should estimate the effect of the biased sampling. The PCR-based infection rate by age groups in Hyogo prefecture and Japan were summarized in S4 Table according to a Japanese government report, and we calculated the expected positive case number per 1,000 samples for each age group in the Hyogo Prefecture at the time points. If we assumed to collect samples from each age groups in the same biased distribution as our cohorts, we expected the PCR positive rate become 0.94% (from 0.85% reported) and 1.6% (from 1.4% reported) at the time points of August and December 2021, respectively. Thus, we suggest that our biased sample collection may have only slight effect on the result of infection rate. The difference between the PCRbased infection and serosurveillance is consistent with the report that a substantial portion of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals are asymptomatic [27] , leading to the inaccuracy of surveillance rates determined solely by PCR diagnosis.",

In December 2021, when the vaccination rate had reached a plateau in Japan, our survey revealed an extremely high seropositive rate, i.e., 90.8% (Table 2 , Fig 1B) .

The high anti-S-positive rate for the age groups 60-69 and 70-83 years observed herein is explained by the priority vaccination for elderly individuals (>65 yrs) in Japan (Fig 1A) .

Although the anti-Spositive rate of the December 2021 cohort showed no apparent difference among age groups (Fig 1B) , our quantitative analysis of the anti-S antibody titers suggested that the increased infection for the 70-to 79-year-olds was the result of the decreased anti-S antibody titers for the elderly age groups (Fig 2B) . Indeed, the anti-S antibody level was significantly lower for the December 2021 cohort compared to that for the August 2021 cohort (Fig 2A) , reflecting the decline of acquired immunity after vaccination (Furukawa et al.

As of December 2021, European countries and U.S. have been invaded by the Omicron variant, which has also been detected across Japan. Actually, the Omicron variant has caused a largest increase of COVID-19 cases ever so called \"6 th wave\" in Japan (S1 Fig). Our neutralization assay against the Omicron variant for the December 2021 cohort, which represents the current Japanese vaccinated population, demonstrated a quite low positive rate, 36.6% (Fig 4A) which appears to be due at least in part to several mutations that occurred in the S protein [5, 30, 31] . We thus contend that the three-dose vaccination to boost the immunity against Omicron is needed to prevent and suppress the further spread of the Omicron variant. Sera with neutralizing activity against the Omicron variant in our December 2021 cohort showed trend of higher anti-S IgG amount (Fig 4C) . Indeed, it has been demonstrated by our group (Furukawa et al. [18] manuscript submitted) and other groups [5, 31] that the third dose booster vaccination is effective to raise neutralization titers against the Omicron variant. Our present findings also demonstrate the efficacy of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 suppression. The booster should be required, in order to increase the population's immunity to the novel variant Omicron. [1] are plotted as the solid line, and the infection rates obtained by our serosurveillance surveys are plotted as the dashed line. The anti-N-positive rate shown by the ECLIA for the October 2020 cohort was obtained from our previous study [18] . The rapid increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, i.e., the so-called 2nd to 5th waves in Japan, are also indicated. For comparison, the ECLIA-based infection rate calculated from the data of Japanese government serosurveillance (https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/ 000734482.pdf, Japanese) was also indicated.

The complete set of 1,000 sera of the December 2021 cohort were subgrouped according to result of the neutralization assay against the Delta variant and the Omicron variant, and the anti-S antibody titers were plotted. Statistical analysis was performed separately for each age group in each cohort one by one, comparing the neutralizing positive and negative groups by Mann-Whitney U-test with showing the P-value. Black bars: medians. D: The neutralization-positive rate calculated for the anti-N-positive (n = 39) and anti-S (n = 908) subsets obtained by extracting the data from those shown in panel A.",
