            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 had a significant impact in the UK, in terms of the number of COVID-19 cases, mortality rate across the population, and the substantial strain imposed on healthcare services. In addition, the pandemic brought with it multiple stressors and potential risk factors for poor mental health, including fear of contracting the virus and its consequences, and concerns about the health of vulnerable family members [7, 8] . For pregnant women (classed as 'vulnerable'), these stressors were likely compounded by worries about the potential consequences of contracting the virus on the foetus (which still remain unknown), as well as general concerns about access to healthcare and support [9] [10] [11] [12] . Indeed, almost half of the pregnant responders in a large survey conducted in the UK during the first peak of the pandemic reported concerns about access to healthcare, and less than onethird of perinatal respondents (including pregnant women and postnatal parents) felt confident that mental health support would be available should they need it [12] . Lockdown periods (instituted to mitigate the spread of the virus) resulted in both physical and social isolation, and thus likely reduced levels of apparent social support [7, 13] . This situation may have disproportionately affected pregnant women, for whom a lack of social support has been identified as a common source of distress [14] and an important correlate of psychological wellbeing [15] . Furthermore, restrictions on movement led some hospitals to prohibit partners attending antenatal check-ups, which may have further exacerbated a sense of lack of support. Thus, it is important to understand how a potential reduction in perceived social support may have impacted the psychological wellbeing of perinatal women during lockdown.",

However, a growing body of evidence suggests that social support is related to psychological wellbeing in the perinatal period [20] and previous studies have highlighted low levels of perceived social support as a risk factor for depression and anxiety in pregnant women (for review see Biaggi et al. [15] ) -although Milgrom et al. [21] found that this relationship was stronger for depression than anxiety. Given that lockdown restrictions limited access to social support at a critical time for pregnant women, it is important to understand the relationship between perceived social support and symptoms of anxiety and depression during this period, as well as the psychological processes underpinning this association. In particular, understanding the way in which potentially modifiable cognitive factors may mediate the relationship between social support and psychological symptoms has scope to highlight potential targets for evidence-based prevention and treatment approaches, both during the pandemic and beyond.",

Previous research has found that loneliness is strongly associated with depression [23] and anxiety [24] . While few studies have focused on perinatal loneliness [25, 26] , there is some evidence that these associations are also present in antenatal and postnatal periods [27] . Loneliness has also been hypothesised as a mediator by Stroebe et al. [28] , who found that social support influences wellbeing through a dual pathway of emotional and social loneliness. Furthermore, loneliness is associated with negative perceptions of social interactions and hypervigilance for social threat information [29, 30] . Thus, those with lower perceived social support may have an increased level of loneliness, which may lead to negative social and cognitive biases which, in turn, may reinforce and foster negative feelings and behaviours associated with depression and anxiety [31] . However, to our knowledge, no data currently exist regarding the extent to which women experienced loneliness in the perinatal period during the pandemic, and whether levels of loneliness mediate the relationship between perceived social support and depression and anxiety during this time.",

These combined observations are consistent with the hypothesis that RNT might mediate the relationship between social support and depression and anxiety. For example, previous research has suggested that one pathway through which social support may exert its effects on wellbeing is via rumination, such that those with lower levels of social support may be more likely to engage in ruminative thoughts [40] . Indeed, there is evidence that RNT mediates the association between peer relationships and depression [39] . In addition, RNT mediates the relationship between loneliness and depression in other cohorts during transitional periods (for example, college students [41, 42] ), suggesting that loneliness and RNT may be serial mediators between perceived social support and depression. However, their role in anxiety is unclear. As far as these authors are aware, this is the first study to investigate a serial mediation model using loneliness and RNT as mediators in these relationships.",

Furthermore, some researchers have suggested the combination of isolationrelated confinement and the general uncertainties that accompany COVID-19 may have led to an increased risk of domestic violence [43, 44] , which is also likely to be associated with both significant mental health consequences, and RNT. For example, ruminative thinking has been found to occur when there is a discrepancy between an idealised or desired state and one's actual experience [45] , and in times of uncertainty. For example, Nolen-Hoeksema (2000) found that participants' rumination often reflected the uncertainty (or lack of control) they felt about their situation. Lockdown restrictions resulted in significant uncertainty and practical disruption for pregnant women (e.g., changes to antenatal appointments, restrictions on partners attending the birth, altered birth plans and a lack of birth preparation classes [46] ;), potentially fuelling RNT and leading to anxiety and depression. Thus, the extent to which RNT during the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on perinatal depression and anxiety warrants investigation.",

In particular, we sought to determine whether perceived social support was associated with psychological symptoms, and if so, whether RNT and loneliness mediated this association. We hypothesised that (i) lower levels of perceived social support would be associated with higher depressive and anxiety symptoms; (ii) that higher levels of loneliness and RNT would be associated with higher depression and anxiety symptoms; and (iii) RNT and loneliness would mediate the relationship between perceived social support and both depression and anxiety. Our secondary aim was to investigate how COVID-19 affected perceived social support, and the mechanism(s) through which pregnant women sought support to mitigate effects of isolation and loneliness.

This finding is consistent with previous research suggesting that poor social support may negatively impact wellbeing due to an increased likelihood of rumination [40] . Conversely, social support may help to protect against mental health issues by reducing loneliness and RNT. One potential mechanism may be that social support reduces self-focused attention, which has previously been related to loneliness [58] and is a key component of rumination [59] . This possibility is consistent with research that has suggested perceived social support may affect the coping strategies implemented in negative contexts. For example, having social support may mean that individuals are better able to talk through (and act on) their issues, which may help to prevent perseverative thinking. In contrast, the absence of such support may result in unproductive negative thought spirals, which in turn may negatively affect mood [60, 61] . The serial mediation pathway through loneliness and then RNT is also consistent with previous work that has found a mediating role of RNT between loneliness and depression in university students [41] . Our findings extend this work and demonstrate that loneliness and RNT combined may mediate not only the relationship between perceived social support and depression, but also the relationship with anxiety. The breakdown of the indirect effects within the mediation model showed that the single mediation path through loneliness (but not RNT) was also significant for both depression and anxiety. The comparison of the three mediation models for depression indicated that the mediating effect of loneliness alone was stronger than the pathway through both mediators together. However, this was not the case for anxiety, suggesting the relative importance of the two mediators varies for depression and anxiety.",

Specifically, using technology to make voice or video calls, or to send texts and video-call groups may be particularly helpful in this regard, while general social media, forum or internet use may not. Preventive interventions which seek to reduce the emergence of psychological symptoms in the perinatal period could potentially encourage pregnant women to maintain social contact via these means. Interestingly, correlations suggest increased internet searching behaviours and app usage for pregnancy/parenting and wellbeing information was associated with increased anxiety. We speculate that anxiety may have driven these behaviours [65] , but the direction of this relationship needs to be tested in future work.",

            "text": "With the exception of antenatal classes (which were inaccessible to most women at the time of data-collection due to the restrictions imposed to control the pandemic), all forms of social contact were significantly negatively correlated with loneliness, and positively correlated with perceived social support. However, group contact with other mums was the only form of contact which was significantly (negatively) correlated with RNT and anxiety scores. This finding reinforces qualitative evidence of peer support being the most valued form of social support amongst women experiencing perinatal anxiety [14] , and accords with evidence of perceived support from friends, but not family, being associated with a reduction in perinatal anxiety-depressive symptoms [66] . However, participants in this study rated partner support as being most important to them; possibly because it was the most readily available form of support available at the time. However, while the effects of COVID-19 on perceived social support outside of the domestic context is readily apparent (i.e., our findings indicated that access to friends, family and antenatal classes was hindered as a direct result of the pandemic), the impact of COVID-19 on support from partners is currently unclear. The exclusion of partners from pre-natal scans and appointments may have had a negative effect on perceptions of support. Conversely, partners remaining at home during the pandemic may have increased women's sense of support. As research shows that partner support is significantly related to maternal prenatal and postnatal mental health [67, 68] , it is possible that COVID-19 may have had a positive impact in this way. However, given the high levels of anxiety and depression seen in this study, any advantages seen from increased partner support may not have been enough to overcome the loss of support in other areas. Alternatively, it may be that the presence of partners at home during the pandemic did not, in fact, translate into more support when partners (as well as pregnant women themselves) were likely working from homeparticularly in households with older children who required care, as well as home-schooling. Indeed, the increased challenges associated with having the whole family at home may have counteracted any benefit of partners physically being there. Furthermore, it is also worth considering the potential negative impact of virus containment policies on women's wellbeing, with research suggesting isolation measures have led to higher rates of domestic violence [43, 44] , which may also lead to significantly elevated levels of psychological distress during this period.",

Understanding how perinatal women have been affected during the recent lockdown, and the potential positive effects of specific forms of social contact, technology use and online behaviours, has the potential to guide the development of interventions to support women's recovery and reduce the long-term psychological consequences of this challenging time. Although aspects of our results (e.g., elevated levels of probable depression and anxiety) are likely to be specific to the pandemic context, the mediating relationship of RNT and loneliness may not be. Further research should explore whether this relationship is replicated in a more typical context of general perinatal wellbeing, and also consider its application in other situations in which perinatal women face extended periods of social isolation (e.g., during prescribed bedrest for pregnancy complications or during recovery from a caesarean birth). Furthermore, the strength of the relationship between RNT and both depression and anxiety symptoms indicate that RNT may be a suitable transdiagnostic target for intervention during the perinatal period. Pregnant women's tendency to engage in RNT could be readily assessed during routine prenatal care (e.g., by administration of a brief self-report measure in the context of routine antenatal appointments with midwives). Such a simple assessment approach has the potential to identify a key psychological vulnerability, and in turn prompt a referral to relevant mental health care provider, which may circumvent fears of disclosure which reduce help seeking behaviours during the perinatal period [14, 69] , and help identify women at-risk of developing clinical symptoms (see Moulds et al. [34] ).",

            "text": "Despite these important implications, several limitations of the study should be acknowledged. First, the cross-sectional design limits the causal conclusions; nonetheless, the mediation path explored benefits from empirical and theoretical grounding. Furthermore, although rates of anxiety and depression were higher than those documented in research conducted outside of the COVID-19 pandemic [1,3] our design does not provide a comparison of measures from before and after COVID-19. As such, it is not possible to comment on the unique impact of the COVID-19 context, nor on how findings may generalise to beyond the pandemic. Second, participants lacked diversity demographically (being predominantly white, educated, over 25, and in relationships) and technologically (as all regularly used technology and were engaged in social media), restricting generalisability. Third, we note that the mean scores for depression and anxiety in our sample were relatively high for participants drawn from the community. One possibility is that the pregnant women who volunteered for this study were particularly vulnerable to experiencing psychological symptoms. However, we note that participants' levels of depression and anxiety were comparable to those reported in other studies of pregnant samples in the UK during the pandemic [12] and beyond [16, 19, 70] . Together, these data suggest that the pandemic had a significant impact on the mental health of pregnant women. Fourth, the variables used were self-report measures which included data on psychopathology symptoms rather than clinical disorders, however understanding such symptoms is vital to improving outcomes for women with subclinical and early manifestations of perinatal mental health disorders [71] . Additionally, self-report measures are subject to social-desirability and response biases which may impact the reliability of the data. Future replications with large community cohorts and including additional measures (e.g., structured clinical interviews) may enhance generalisability, reliability and validity.",

Given the relative similarity of the findings for depression and anxiety (and the high levels of comorbidity between these symptoms, [72] ), our results suggest that transdiagnostic treatment approaches which target modifiable behaviours may have utility in the perinatal period. In particular, the findings suggest that interventions to promote wellbeing may benefit from targeting RNT (e.g., by tailoring existing interventions to perinatal populations, such as that of Hirsch et al. [73] ), as well as incorporating strategies to bolster social support and reduce loneliness (e.g., promoting practical social behaviours such as scheduling times to contact friends and family, or focusing on peer support models, which have an element of social support built into them), in order to prevent and reduce depression and anxiety in pregnancy. This study may be a useful resource for perinatal healthcare professionals to help them identify women at risk of anxiety and depression in the prenatal period, and create protective and preventive approaches to support them.",

The analysis showed that the total effect of social support on depression was significant (without the mediators) (c=-.13, SE = .03, t(201)= -4.81, p < .001). In addition, perceived social support significantly predicted both mediators: loneliness (b a1 = -.06, SE = .01, t(201)= -7.22, p < .001) and RNT (b a2 = -.14, SE = .06, t (200)= -2.40, p = .02); and the direct effect of the first mediating variable (loneliness) on the second mediating variable (RNT) was also significant (b a3 = 1.63, SE = .41, t(200)= -3.96, p < .001). When perceived social support and the two mediating variables were entered sequentially into the model, the significant relationship between MPSS and depression disappeared (c'= -.03, SE = .03, t(199) = -1.28, p = .20). This result indicates that loneliness and RNT fully mediate the relationship between perceived social support and depression. Moreover, the overall model was significant (F(5, 199)= 20.27, p<.001).",
