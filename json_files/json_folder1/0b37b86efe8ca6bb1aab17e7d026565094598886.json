However, 30% of the orthodontists believed information regarding personal financial guidelines was lacking. Most respondents identified delayed treatment progress and temporary staff layoffs as the two most negative ramifications of mandated office closures. Approximately 93% of practices applied for and utilized some sort of stimulus funding offered through the CARES Act. Respondents indicated that the COVID-19 related office closures resulted in an average of 50% decrease in net revenue.",

COVID-19 is a singlestranded RNA virus that is extremely contagious, with confirmed cases in nearly every region of the globe. 8 Due to the significant impact of COVID-19 on all aspects of life, various mandates have been imposed on communities across the world that encourage public social distancing and self-isolation to help prevent the spread of this deadly virus. 9 Social distancing and self-isolation practices have obvious ramifications on businesses and medical professions, including dental/orthodontic offices.",

In addition, significantly more females felt the mandates were necessary compared to males. Fifty-nine percent of females and only 45% of males felt the limitations placed on patient care within orthodontic practices were necessary (p = 0.006). Just over 50% of the participants felt that guidelines set by local and state governments regarding limitations to all but emergency and essential care in orthodontic practices were necessary overall, and the most critical subset of the sample to these mandates were practitioners in solo and group private practices (p = 0.044). Figure 1 illustrates the information sources survey respondents utilized most during the early stages of the pandemic. Approximately, three-quarters of the participants accessed information from professional associations, and 61% used internet/online news sources. The gathering of information from internet and online news sources was statistically significant with the youth of the respondent (p = 0.024), but the use of social media, specifically, was not similarly correlated with age. While obtaining information from vendors and print media was not selected by many participants, the orthodontists that selected this option were in the most senior age groups (p = 0.001 and 0.005, respectively) and practicing in suburban and rural areas (p = 0.034). Figure 2 illustrates which sources provided participants with the most helpful information. Roughly half of the respondents stated that the most helpful sources of information were state or local dental associations (53%) and the AAO (50%). According to the participants, the most helpful sources providing information regarding COVID-19 were the state or local dental associations, AAO, ADA and CDC, in descending order. The older the participants' age group, the more they utilized the AAO as a source for obtaining information (p = 0.004), and the larger the practice, the more likely the respondents were to select the AAO as a helpful information source (p = 0.003). The same trend held true regarding age and practice size and the attitudes toward the ADA as an information source (p = 0.038). Practitioners in rural and suburban practice settings and those in smaller practices also tended to rate professional associations highly as sources of helpful information (p = 0.018 and 0.007, respectively). Half of the respondents ranked COVID-19 mitigation, prevalence, and spread as the topics for which J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f they were able to collect the most useful information. Information regarding practice business management, small business resources, and personal financial guidance were generally rated as lacking by about 1/3 of the participants (figure 3). It is interesting to note that while professional associations, such as the AAO and ADA, were listed as useful sites to glean information, when asked if guidelines set forth by these organizations were helpful in the early management of the pandemic, 55% of respondents felt the professional associations did not provide sufficient guidance in these critical early days.

When considering the national distribution of orthodontists, our sample was slightly over-weighted geographically to Indiana practices. While this is not unexpected, given the survey originated from the only Indiana state dental school, we do not believe the numbers are so severely disproportionate as to overly skew the nationwide intent of the survey, as evidenced by the strong participation of all AAO constituent society group regions. Regarding respondent gender, our sample was split nearly 50/50 male to female. This ratio is not as well aligned with national data for gender distribution in the orthodontic profession, which is closer to a 70/30 male to female distribution. Our sample also trended a bit younger than the AAO demographic data might suggest. Two important considerations should be noted regarding these relationships. First, it has been demonstrated that females are more likely to participate in surveys compared to males. 14, 15 Additionally, in the attempt to disseminate the survey as broadly as possible to a nationwide audience, the decision was made to approach the Women in Orthodontics Facebook\u2122 group. While realizing this could create a gender bias in the survey, we believed the need for obtaining a large number of responses as quickly as possible due to the time-sensitive, fluid nature of the pandemic, outweighed any potential risks of bias. This could also explain the slight tilt of our sample towards younger orthodontists (40% of our participants were between the ages of 30-39), as the ratio of male to female orthodontists in the under-35 age range is roughly 50/50.",

Additionally, practices within these two geographic areas had the highest percentage responses in the 61-80% estimated losses range.
