            "text": "Validated assays are essential for reliable serosurveys; however, most SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays have been validated using specimens from China, Europe, or U.S. populations. We evaluated the performance of five commercial SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays to inform their use in serosurveys in Nigeria. Four semiquantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) (Euroimmun anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein [NCP] immunoglobulin G [IgG], Euroimmun spike SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Mologic Omega COVID-19 IgG, Bio-Rad Platelia SARS-CoV-2 Total Ab) and one chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG) were evaluated. We estimated the analytical performance characteristics using plasma from 100 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive patients from varied time points post-PCR confirmation and 100 prepandemic samples (50 HIV positive and 50 hepatitis B positive). The Bio-Rad assay failed the manufacturer-specified validation steps. The Euroimmun NCP, Euroimmun spike, and Mologic assays had sensitivities of 73.7%, 74.4%, and 76.9%, respectively, on samples taken 15 to 58 days after PCR confirmation and specificities of 97%, 100%, and 83.8%, respectively. The Abbott assay had 71.3% sensitivity and 100% specificity on the same panel. Parallel or serial algorithms combining two tests did not substantially improve the sensitivity or specificity. Our results showed lower sensitivity and, for one immunoassay, lower specificity compared to the manufacturers' results and other reported validations. Seroprevalence estimates using these assays might need to be interpreted with caution in Nigeria and similar settings. These findings highlight the importance of in-country validations of SARS-CoV-2 serological assays prior to use to ensure that accurate results are available for public health decision-making to control the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa.",

Using these prepandemic and SARS-CoV-2-positive samples, we found much lower levels of sensitivity in four commercially available assays than most assay manufacturer reports and independent evaluations. The use of these assays with suboptimal sensitivity and specificity in Nigeria or countries with population exposure to similar endemic pathogens could lead to a biased estimate of the seroprevalence, over-or underestimating the true disease prevalence, and limit efforts to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2. It is important to conduct in-country validations of serological SARS-CoV-2 assays prior to their widespread use, especially in countries with limited representation in published assay validations.",

Reports from the World Health Organization (WHO) indicate that more than 80% of Africans infected with COVID-19 were asymptomatic, compared to an estimated 40% to 50% seen in the rest of the world; mortality due to COVID-19 was also significantly reduced (1) . Asymptomatic cases of infectious diseases complicate the tracking of epidemics and prevent reliable estimates of transmission and thus mitigation measures (2) . SARS-CoV-2 serological surveys can be valuable methods to assess asymptomatic infections, monitor SARS-CoV-2 infections across the population, and inform mathematical models that predict the course of the epidemic to guide public health decisions to halt its spread (3) .",

According to WHO, it is desirable that antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 have at least 98% sensitivity and 99% specificity (4) . Several independent studies have validated commercially available serological assays and showed sensitivities of .90% in samples taken at least 14 days after the onset of symptoms and nearly 100% specificity (5) (6) (7) . The validation of serological assays in the specific regions where they are being deployed for use is important to ensure that the tests meet a minimum requirement for diagnostic performance in the population targeted for use (8, 9) . Some independent validations using samples from the United States and Denmark have shown lower levels of sensitivity (10) and specificity (11) for tests, including the Euroimmun immunoglobulin G (IgG) spike protein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), compared to the manufacturers' performance characteristics, highlighting the importance of additional test validations. Furthermore, despite a growing number of available SARS-CoV-2 assays, much of the validation data to date comes from populations in China, the United States, and Europe; there is a gap in the validation data of these serological assays in different populations, given especially that the pattern of infection seen in Africa is different from that in the rest of the world (12, 13) .",

Regardless of the background prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, the use of the Omega assay would significantly overestimate the number of infected individuals due to a large number of false-positive results. Likewise, the use of the Euroimmune NCP assay would overestimate the seroprevalence but less so than with the Mologic assay. The Abbott and the Euroimmun spike assays would underestimate the true seroprevalence because of their imperfect sensitivities and specificities of 100%. The performance of the tests alone and in a two-test algorithm depended on the background SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence; a parallel algorithm using the Abbott and Euroimmun spike assays appeared to perform best, although either assay alone was nearly as good.

This study is one of the first validations of SARS-CoV-2 serological assays conducted on samples from an African population, adding to the small but growing evidence pool from the region (12, 13) . The assays tested were chosen based on manufacturer-reported performance and availability in Nigeria for use in large household COVID-19 serosurveys. Regarding the two assays with FDA EUA (Abbott Architect and Euroimmun spike), sensitivity for the Abbott was substantially lower than that reported by the manufacturer and other evaluations. Our study found a 76.3% sensitivity of the Abbott assay on day 15 or greater, compared to 100% sensitivity on day 14 or greater according to Abbott (14) and one independent evaluation (15) and 95.2% for samples from patients 12 or more days from symptom onset according to another evaluation (16) . For the Euroimmun spike assay, the sensitivity according to the manufacturer at 11 or more days after PCR test is 81% (and according to an independent evaluation, 90%-the timing of samples post-symptom onset or PCR test not available) (17) and thus comparable to the sensitivity we found. Other independent validations have found sensitivities for the Euroimmun spike assay of 78% at day 21 or more after PCR confirmation (10) and of 100% at day 4 or more (5). Independent evaluations of the Mologic IgG ELISA and the Euroimmun NCP assay are more limited but showed higher sensitivities than our validation. A semi-independent evaluation of the Mologic IgG ELISA found a markedly higher sensitivity than we did, at 94% (95% CI, 89.6% to 96.8%) for samples on day 10 or more post-laboratory diagnosis (18) . One previous evaluation of the Euroimmun NCP assay found sensitivities of 88.9% for samples (and 92.9% for the same samples using the Euroimmun spike assay) collected 26 or more days after a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR (19) , and the sensitivity according to the manufacturer is 86.7% for samples collected more than 10 days after symptom onset for PCR test (20) . The lower sensitivities observed in our study might be explained by differences in the severity of disease. Several studies have suggested higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibody in patients with severe versus mild disease (21-23). Although we did not find a significant difference in sensitivity correlated with the presence of symptoms, our sample size was relatively small, and the samples were mostly provided from ambulatory patients. We also found that the testing algorithms of the assays included improved performance only marginally over single tests. However, even small changes in test specificity can have large impacts on the falsepositivity rate; thus, validation of assay specificity using a larger negative sample set might be warranted.",

The positive panel consisted of convalescent plasma samples collected from ambulatory participants 18 years and older visiting the NIMR modified drive-through center, who had been diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 positive using PCR-based methods at NIMR. The study participants consented to specimen storage and future testing after testing positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus at NIMR. After giving consent, the patients were invited back for blood draws within 0 to 3 days, 4 to 7 days, 8 to 14 days, 15 to 28 days, and greater than or equal to 29 days. All samples were contributed by single individuals except for two individuals, who contributed positive convalescent-phase samples at two different time intervals. Both the archived prepandemic plasma samples and the plasma samples from the positive patients were stored at 220\u00b0C in the NIMR biorepository with no dilution prior to storage and a maximum of three freeze/thaw cycles.",

The Cobas 6800 system is a fully automated system for sample-to-result qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2. The Cobas targets the conserved regions within the ORF1ab gene and the E gene. The procedure was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the BGI real-time fluorescent RT-PCR, viral RNA was extracted from oropharyngeal and nasal swabs using the QIAamp viral RNA minikit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and then tested using the BGI real-time fluorescent RT-PCR kit to detect SARS-CoV-2. The BGI assay targets the SARS-CoV-2 ORF1 region. The viral extraction and BGI assay were conducted following the manufacturers' instructions.",

Statistical analysis. We estimated the sensitivity and specificity, using the positive and negative panels, respectively, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using the exact method. With 100 samples each (positive and negative panel), we estimated that the sensitivity and specificity could be estimated with a margin of error of less than 10% and 5%, assuming a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 100%, respectively (i.e., 95% CI, ,610% for sensitivity and #5% for specificity). In addition to assessing the diagnostic accuracy of the individual assays, we also tested two types of algorithms combining two different assays: a parallel strategy and a sequential strategy. In the parallel strategy, a positive result was defined as either of the two tests being positive. In the sequential strategy, a positive result was defined as both tests being positive. We included only assays with specificities greater than 95% in the algorithms. We also estimated the sensitivity of the assays and algorithms stratified by days post-confirmation of infection as follows: 0 to 3 days, 4 to 7 days, 8 to 14 days, 15 to 28 days, and 29 to 58 days. The test sensitivity was also estimated by restricting the samples to those taken between days 15 and 58 . We estimated the association between false-negative results and clinical characteristics (age, sex, and symptoms) using a logistic regression model. We fitted models by including one of the above covariates at a time while adjusting for days post-confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Age was treated as a continuous variable and sex and symptoms as binary variables. We modeled the positive and negative predictive values at SARS-CoV-2 prevalences of 1% and 5%, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) estimated using a method proposed by Mercaldo et al. (29) . We also modeled the number of true-positive and false-positive results in 10,000 individuals within a setting of SARS-CoV-2 prevalences of 1%, 5%, and 10%. For this analysis, we used sensitivities that were estimated in samples taken 15 to 58 days post-confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. All statistical analyses were performed using R version 4.0.2.",
