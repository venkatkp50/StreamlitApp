A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in China from 7 May to 25 May in 2020. A total of 1212 participants from the general population completed the survey measuring their stigmatizing attitudes towards COVID-19, as well as knowledge and causal attributions of COVID-19. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to examine the correlates of COVID-19-related public stigma. A total of 31.8% of participants endorsed stigmatization towards people with COVID-19. Those who were of older age (t = \u22123.97, p < 0.001), married (F = 3.04, p < 0.05), had a lower level of education (F = 8.11, p < 0.001), and a serious psychological response (F = 3.76, p < 0.05) reported significantly higher scores of public stigma. Dangerousness (B = 0.047, p < 0.001), fear (B = 0.059, p < 0.001), anger (B = 0.038, p < 0.01), and responsibility (B = 0.041, p < 0.001) were positively associated with public stigma. This study shows that public stigma related to COVID-19 is prevalent in the general population of China. Actions against public stigma need to contain the spread of misinformation about COVID-19, alter inappropriate attributions, alleviate unfavorable reactions, and provide psychosocial support for the public.

The pandemic of COVID-19 not only jeopardizes the physical health of those infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but it also arouses a new wave of public stigmatization in the general population towards them [2] . In the context of health, public stigmatization is contextualized as a process of labeling, stereotyping, and discriminating against people with a certain disease [3] . It is also not uncommon that, as the outbreaks of newly emerging infectious diseases escalate, disease-related public stigmatization often follows inside and beyond the hot zones [4] . Recent examples of public stigmatization during infectious disease outbreaks include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [5] , H1N1 influenza [6] , Ebola [7] , and Zika [8] .",

First, it may hinder COVID-19 patients' help-seeking behaviors, leading to unnecessary delays in diagnosis and treatment and promoting continued infection transmission of COVID-19. Second, in addition to COVID-19 per se, COVID-19-related public stigmatization may increase COVID-19 patients' psychological burdens and therefore worsen their clinical outcomes. Third, even for those patients who survived, stigma may continue to be attached to them, resulting in social exclusion and ostracism and eventually compromising their physical, emotional, and mental health. Moreover, given sociodemographic differences (e.g., based on race/ethnicity, gender, and age) of COVID-19 incidence and mortality [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] , public stigmatization towards COVID-19 patients can exacerbate the already pervasive \"us vs. them\" mentality in society, and undermine social cohesion and global solidarity which matters even more during the crisis of COVID-19.",

            "text": "Given the severe epidemic situation of COVID-19 across the globe, public stigma of COVID-19 is more likely to be our threat than the disease itself [17] . Misconceptions and lack of knowledge about COVID-19, along with high fear levels of COVID-19, have been confirmed to be associated with more stigmatizing attitudes towards people associated with the context of COVID-19, such as healthcare providers and Asians in the United States [18] [19] [20] . A national online survey in Bangladesh reported that stigmatizing attitudes related to COVID-19 in the general population was significantly associated with marital status, educational level, living conditions, and perception of risk [21] . Research on public stigma posited that individuals' perceptions of stigmatized conditions were associated with their cognitive attributions and affective responses [22] . According to Weiner's attribution theory, if individuals are perceived to be capable of controlling the occurrence of their diseases and to be responsible for their own infections, they are more likely to be stigmatized [23] . In addition to causal attributions about controllability and responsibility, individuals' fearful and irritated responses are also linked with stigmatization [24] . Such correlations have been found in numerous studies about public stigmatization towards mental illness, HIV/AID, and disabilities [25] [26] [27] . Within the framework of attribution theory and prior empirical studies, we proposed that public stigma towards people with COVID-19 would be linked with different attributions and unfavorably emotional responses.",

Given people with COVID-19 would be forcibly quarantined in China, we removed one item: \"People with COVID-19 should be quarantined\". Therefore, the final version of the Public Stigma of COVID-19 Scale consisted of 11 items, such as \"People with COVID-19 are revolting\". Items were rated on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree), with higher scores indicating more public stigma. The Public Stigma of COVID-19 Scale had sound internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.83).",

Descriptive analysis was performed to summarize the sociodemographic characteristics by presenting percentages, means, and standard deviations. We used the independent-samples t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare the scores of public stigma by categories of various sociodemographic characteristics. As for the Public Stigma of COVID-19 Scale, we calculated the means and standard deviations for each item. In addition, agreement or strong agreement with one certain item of the Public Stigma of COVID-19 Scale was considered as endorsement. In terms of total public stigma, respondents who reported average scores greater than 3 were treated as endorsing public stigma. We presented the prevalence of endorsement of each item and the total public stigma. A correlation matrix was used to examine the correlations between public stigma of COVID-19 and other continuous variables including knowledge about COVID-19, causal attributions (i.e., dangerousness, fear, blame, anger, controllability, and responsibility), and willingness for help-seeking. In addition, a stepwise linear regression with different blocks was applied to examine the correlates of public stigma. Variables significantly associated with public stigma in univariate analyses were entered into three models of multivariate linear regression. Model 1 included demographic factors, model 2 involved general information related to COVID-19, and model 3 was related to causal attributions of COVID-19. P-values of < 0.05 were deemed to be significant in this study. Table 1 displays the sociodemographic profile of 1212 participants, as well as the scores of public stigma by categories of various sociodemographic characteristics. The majority of the participants were female (73.27%) and were less than or equal to 30 years old (73.27%). Over half of the participants were single (65.10%) and had a college degree (68.65%). A small percentage of the participants (12.16%) worked on the health frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of the participants (64.36%) self-reported a severe psychological response to the pandemic.

Participants who were of younger age, single status, had higher levels of education and a mild psychological response reported lower scores of public stigma. There were no significant differences on scores of public stigma by participants' gender, employment status, monthly income, and health frontline status. ",

In Model 1, the age group and education level were significantly associated with public stigma. Compared with participants of younger age and with higher levels of education, those of older age (B = 0.182, p < 0.01) and with lower levels of education (B = \u22120.202, p < 0.01) scored higher on public stigma. In Model 2, it was shown that compared with participants with a severe psychological response to the pandemic of COVID-19, those with a mild response reported a significant lower score of public stigma (B = \u22120.172, p < 0.01). In Model 3, the significant relationship between psychological response and public stigma disappeared after adding causal attributions of COVID-19.

Moreover, the more participants considered that people infected with COVID-19 was their own responsibility (B = 0.041, p < 0.001), the higher levels of public stigma they had.

Nearly 80% of the participants preferred to keep social distancing with people infected with COVID-19, and more than half of the participants showed worries and fear when they came into contact with people with COVID-19. In term of affective aspects, however, only a few participants showed some tendency towards revolting or annoying attitudes. This finding might suggest that public perceptions of people with COVID-19 were contradictory. Given the infectiousness and mortality of COVID-19, it is not surprising that the general public approve of evading people suffering from COVID-19. Additionally, a strict quarantine policy in China during the pandemic might have increased the likelihood of people's stigmatizing attitudes. A previous study conducted in Wuhan showed that those who were more familiar with quarantined cases were more likely to perceive higher levels of stigma [33] .",

Prior studies pertaining to stigmatization also indicate that knowledge is one of the essential factors reducing prejudice towards the stigmatized group [43, 44] . For the future, with the outbreak of newly emerging infectious disease, accurate information needs to be disseminated to reduce public misunderstanding, thereby reducing social stigma. Interestingly, after adjusting for other factors in the regression model of this study, however, the significant correlation between knowledge and public stigma disappeared. It might indicate that the role of knowledge on generating public attitudes was negligible given that COVID-19 was a novel infectious illness, and which has been confirmed in a previous study [26] .

            "text": "Plenty of prior studies, based on attribution theory, have indicated that controllability is significantly correlated with stigmatizing ideas [24, [45] [46] [47] . However, this correlation was not shown in this study. A possible explanation may be related to the feature of COVID-19. Although COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease, people can recover by medical treatment and the disease does not pose momentous outcomes to others as long as the infected individuals receive timely treatment. A previous study compared public stigma amongst three infectious illnesses and concluded that disease attribution and stigma were subordinated to characteristics of the disease itself. Specifically, compared with SARS, the general population believed infection of HIV/AIDS to be more controllable by the person, as a result, they held more stigmatization towards people with HIV/AIDS [26] . We found that the general population who attributed more personal responsibility to people having COVID-19 were inclined to endorse more stigma. In line with previous studies related to stigma, the current study also confirmed that public stigma were significantly connected to the general populations' effective response to the people infected with COVID-19 [18] . A prior study indicating that great danger appraisal predicted more stigmatizations could support the results of this study [48] . For instance, those who felt more dangerous and expressed more fear and anger were more likely to perceive stigmatizing ideas.",

            "text": "Several limitations in this study should be acknowledged. First, since the data was collected during the outbreak of COVID-19, we utilized an online survey method which is feasible and safe considering the transmission of coronavirus. As a result, those who had limited access to the internet, such as elderly people, were less likely to participate in our study. Another feature of the sample distribution in this study was that the majority of respondents were female (73.27%). This might be explained by gender difference [49] , as several previous studies collecting data during the COVID-19 outbreak by using an online survey also reported a similar gender discrepancy in the sample distribution [50, 51] . Given the time of assessment of this study, it may also have an effect. The high level of public stigma might relate to the uncertainty about the virus and the lack of scientific knowledge at the outbreak of COVID-19. However, this round of data might still be used as a baseline to provide a reference for a long-term follow up survey of the public stigma related COVID-19. In addition, a cross-sectional design cannot demonstrate the cause-and-effect relationships among knowledge, attribution factors, and public stigma. Thus, a longitudinal design should be considered in future studies to elucidate the effect of attribution on public stigma and to examine the attribution model in COVID-19. With respect to measurements, the scale measuring public stigma was modified from an instrument used in the issue attached to mental illness. Given the possible divergence of the stigma mechanism between mental illness and COVID-19, it might not capture the full profile of the COVID-19-related stigma. Even though the reliability of the instruments for public stigma in this study is acceptable, it would be better if we could use a more standardized measurement in a future study for comparison across various research studies. Finally, several other factors which are not contained in the present study might explain attitudes towards COVID-19 in the general population as well. For instance, the media reports of untrue information about disease transmission and coverage of infected people with the disease label might increase the likelihood of stigmatization ideas in the general population [52] .",

The current study demonstrates the association between lack of knowledge and endorsement of stigmatizing notions among the general population, which implies the necessity of disseminating accurate information of COVID-19 to diminish misunderstanding. In addition, our study indicates stigma to be related to attributions of the disease. The policies targeted to reduce stigmatizing attitudes, therefore, should focus on guiding the public to have appropriate attributions of the COVID-19 infection. In the long run, anti-stigmatization should be a focus of public health policies to make the public hold a more accepting attitude towards infectious disease (e.g., COVID-19, etc.) and infected people.",

Given the role of attributions influencing public attitudes towards people with COVID-19, it is not only essential to design health communication programs to contain the spread of misinformation about COVID-19, but also to develop strategies to alter inappropriate causal attributions of COVID-19 in the general population. On account of the significant relationships between emotional response (e.g., fear, anger) and public stigma, more attention should be placed on alleviating these unfavorable reactions and providing psychosocial support for individuals trapped in emotional distress due to the pandemic. Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic is still continuing around the world. Nevertheless, the social stigmatization might be even more prolonged and extend to recovered patients and healthcare professionals according to the preceding stigma studies related to SARS and Ebola [31, 34, 53] . Therefore, stigmatization towards COVID-19 should be understood and addressed in the context of combatting infectious diseases.",
