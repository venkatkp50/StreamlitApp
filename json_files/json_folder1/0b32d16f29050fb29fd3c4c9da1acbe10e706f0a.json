The purpose of this study is to examine which socioeconomic status groups are most at risk of treatment interruption among Japanese workers. Methods: This cross-sectional internet monitor study was conducted among Japanese workers on December 22-26, 2020. Out of a total of 33 302 participants in the survey, 9510 (5392 males and 4118 females) who responded that they required regular treatment or hospital visits were included in the analysis. A multilevel logistic model nested in the prefecture of residence was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for treatment disruption. We examined separate multivariate models for socioeconomic factors, health factors, and lifestyle factors. Results: During a period of rapid COVID-19 infection, about 11% of Japanese workers who required regular treatment experienced interruptions to their treatment. The OR of treatment interruption associated with not being married compared with being married was 1.44 (95%CI: 1.17-1.76); manual labor work compared with desk work 2 of 10 | FUJIMOTO eT al.",

Subsequently, the country experienced peaks of infection in April and August 2020, which lasted for relatively short periods of time. The number of infected people and deaths was considered low compared with that in other countries. However, in November 2020, the number of infections rose again, and in December, Japan was experiencing its third wave of infection. This time, a larger number of people were becoming infected compared with the previous two waves. The hospital bed occupancy rate was high, and medical treatment was being affected. In January 2021, the Japanese government declared a second state of emergency for 11 prefectures.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has caused interruptions to chronic disease and non-emergency treatment around the world. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] In the United States, 40% of adults are reportedly avoiding medical care. 1 According to a survey of 47 countries, only 14% of responding healthcare providers continued to provide normal face-to-face care. 2 In Japan, the number of prescriptions in May 2020 made up just 75% of the prescriptions given out 1 year prior in May 2019. 3 In pediatrics and otolaryngology, the number of prescriptions halved. 3 There are several reasons why treatment may be being interrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Because hospitals are perceived as high-risk places for infection, patients may be voluntarily abstaining from treatment because they are concerned about becoming infected in the hospital. 1 In addition, many medical institutions are rescheduling visits with nonemergency patients to enable them to deal with COVID-19 and to set up fever outpatient clinics. 6, 7 It is also likely that the financial impact of COVID-19 is causing patients to discontinue treatment, given that financial difficulties generally lead to interruption of treatment for chronic diseases. [8] [9] [10] Delay or avoidance of medical care may increase excess mortality directly or indirectly related to COVID-19. 1 Delays and avoidance of treatment can lead to worse management of chronic diseases, missed opportunities for regular checkups, and missed or delayed initiation of treatment for deteriorating health conditions. This results in an increase of morbidity and mortality from health conditions that are otherwise treatable or preventable. 4, 11, 12 Furthermore, interruptions to treatment among workers increase presenteeism, 13 a practice in which individuals continue to work while unwell. Continued presenteeism can lead to lower productivity, further deterioration of health status, and even difficulties with staying in the labor market. 14 Anxieties related to possible infection after seeking medical care and the need to reschedule regular medical appointments due to the COVID-19 pandemic are causing interruptions to medical treatment for workers. In addition, economic insecurity and job insecurity are causing workers to feel that they need to make their presence known to management, which can discourage workers from actively taking sick leave.",

Details of the protocol of this survey have already been reported. 15 Briefly, data were collected from workers who had employment contracts at the time of the survey, and were assigned by prefecture, job type, and sex. Since was 1.30 (95%CI: 1.11-1.52); loss of employment when the COVID-19 pandemic started and continued unemployment compared with being employed over the entire pandemic period was 1.62 (95%CI: 1.13-2.31) and 2.57 (95%CI: 1.63-4.07), respectively; and feeling financially unstable was 2.92 (95%CI: 2.25-3.80). Conclusion: Treatment interruption is a new health inequality brought about by COVID-19 with possible medium-and long-term effects, including excess mortality, morbidity, and productivity loss due to increased presenteeism. Efforts are needed to reduce treatment interruptions among workers who require regular treatment. COVID-19 infection rates, hospital visits, hospital bed utilization rates, and socioeconomic status vary widely from region to region, we adopted regional sampling in this study.",

These results are consistent with reports on the impact of economic deprivation on treatment discontinuation due to COVID-19 in other countries. 1 While we were unable to determine causality due to the cross-sectional nature of this study, it is possible that there is causality in both directions in the relationship between socioeconomic status and treatment discontinuation. Economic deprivation can be a direct reason for treatment interruption. 8, 18 Workers in precarious employment situations may not have the right to sick leave or may be hesitant to take sick leave, 13, 19 and thus give up treatment.

The causal relationship between health status and treatment interruption may also be bi-directional. Several studies have reported that a major reason for treatment interruption is anxiety related to becoming infected when visiting a hospital. 1, 2, 4 In the present study, greater psychological distress was associated with higher odds of discontinuing treatment, suggesting that anxiety about infection may influence treatment discontinuation. In addition, subjects who did not receive company support were more likely to discontinue treatment. This may be because company support includes adjustment of an individual's work hours for treatment and encouragement from management for the worker to see a doctor. Loneliness may also be related to whether or not a work colleague is able to accompany the subject to the doctor. Alternatively, treatment interruption may lead to deterioration of health status. Treatment interruption can increase the incidence of serious myocardial infarction. 4 It is also possible that treatment interruption may lead to deterioration in health status and self-rated health.",

Unfavorable lifestyle habits may be related to health literacy, 20,21 which may in turn affect adherence to regular medical visits and treatment. 22 This finding emphasized that a strategy to ensure that outreach messages are delivered efficiently is needed, especially to populations with low health literacy. It is also conceivable that the relationship between lifestyle and treatment interruption may be confounded by socioeconomic status. Our findings also suggest that increased commute times and overtime work may reduce workers' free time and hinder them from seeking medical attention, which is consistent with the findings of a previous study. 23, 24 Treatment discontinuation is a health disparity caused by COVID-19 and is an emerging public health issue. This study shows the relationship between socioeconomic status and treatment discontinuation in terms of health disparities. Regardless of the causal relationship, individuals with more disadvantaged socioeconomic status and health status were more likely to experience treatment interruption. It is therefore paramount that we prepare for the possibility that COVID-19 may not only threaten as an acute infectious disease, but also by affecting the prognosis and complications of those with chronic and lifestyle-related diseases through the socioeconomic environment. Campaigns to encourage the public to refrain from interrupting treatment are important. Relevant medical organizations and the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in Japan are already conducting such campaigns. Telemedicine is a promising method by which to handle treatment interruptions arising due to infection-related anxiety. 25 Extending the length of prescriptions is also a good approach. However, the safety of these approaches must be monitored, given that there are now fewer opportunities to observe patients' health status. Our findings also demonstrate the importance of proactive support by companies to facilitate the delivery of treatment to sick workers. Such support is expected to reduce presenteeism and improve labor productivity.",
