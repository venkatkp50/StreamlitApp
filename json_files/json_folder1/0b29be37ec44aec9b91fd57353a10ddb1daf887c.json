Even though therapeutic reforms are happening, medication discrepancies are the prime cause of hospitalization. This has generated an invincible demand for clinical pharmacy services. Accordingly, a program that collaborates the clinical preceptor and students of department of pharmacy practice with the hospital's medical team, has been established. Any individual who has doubts on medicines can inquire through Dr MED, a virtual clinical pharmacy platform. The operating procedure of the program is presented in the article, where the program's coordinator and the pharmacy students play a significant role in sorting out the queries and finding out the evidences. On the other hand, the medical team composed of physicians and clinical pharmacists acts as a supporting component. Finally, the decision on how and what to respond to the inquirer is upon the opinions put forward by the medical team. Moreover, the system also addresses all the clinical concerns confined to medicines that ultimately enhances the patient's treatment outcome.",

Advanced knowledge and skills confined to medicine and medicine-related matters are the pre-requisite to post a pharmacy practictioners in a medical team. Moran et al. recognized their role in optimizing therapy with cost-effective approaches and their contribution towards facilitating antibiotic scrutiny, and educating physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers. 1 Moreover, the pharmacy authorities of France employed clinical pharmacists to tackle the shortage of essential drugs such as anesthetics and high alert medication during the pandemic. Their efficiency in selecting the appropriate substituent, elevated their role during the COVID 19 era. 2,3 A collaborative medical team incorporating the clinical pharmacists would supply better patient care and treatment outcomes. 4 The entry of pharmacy practice discipline to healthcare demonstrated improved quality and safe administration of medicines. Physicians were pleased with the effort put in by the clinical pharmacist. Sensitive streams such as oncology, nephrology, and cardiology significantly benefited from their interventions. 5 Despite that, even though people are the beneficiaries, they are less aware of the contribution of pharmacy practitioners in the hospital and community settings. 6 Our society is very much cautious about their health, and their apprehensions rise when they are offered a treatment for their disease. This would mostly tempt them for a second medical opinion. Dingfiled and Kayser recommended an advanced care planning system that would assist patients in knowing more about their diagnosis and prognosis and enable friendly discussions with their medical experts on the possible outcomes and goals. This system has relaxed and reverted those under treatment from anticipations. 7 Despite that, there are numerous communities in India with limited access to healthcare. George et al. stated that the lack of medical facilities in remote areas had imposed a demand for implementing strategies to counter this situation and establish universal health coverages to all in need. 8 Moreover, physical accessibility barriers, economic constraints, and social hindrances are the other prevailing factors that restrict many from directing themselves to treat. 9 In order to occupy and assist a larger population with a wide range of disabilities and negative perceptions, an authentic medical guide is invincible. COVID19 had set forth a new online era and web-based services unfurling throughout India. 10 However, this pace is not observed in the health and medical discipline. Even though novel medicine dispensing platforms are sprouting, its utilization can be affected by the unawareness and unavailability of prescribed or required drugs, and social stigmas. In the U.S., an information technology-based pharmaceutical company was prosecuted for counterfeit medications. 11 The situation is severe in India, where various drug safety issues are raised through published articles. 12 Nevertheless, e-pharmacy services are growing around cities and towns. 13 In this context, each pharmacy practitioner should work hand in hand with drug inspectors of that locality to ensure rational utilization of medications. Moreover, proper awareness program for the community pharmacists as well as the public is inevitable and should emphasize the importance of safe administration and consumption of drugs. Hence, clinical pharmacist role in the benign phase of e-pharmacy is unavoidable.",

Healthcare stream needs quicker responses, and they also sort for such summarized information. 16, 17 b. For people The reputed medicine reference tools are payable to subscribe and has limited accessibility for the people. Moreover, pharmacists in both community and hospital settings are disparate with workload and few postings in clinical pharmacy discipline has diminished pharmaceutical care and counseling facilities for people. 18 In these circumstances, Koster et al. recommended the implementation of tele-pharmacy services. 18 Epic, Allscripts, CureMD, eClinicalWorks, and Cerner are some of the well known electronic health records systems that provide patient service portals. [19] [20] [21] [22] These systems offer virtual pharmaceutical care and are quite beneficial to patients who have access to it. In India, as part of the government's Digital Health Mission, the electronic health records has gained populatrity. Pai et al. had put forward a standard, secure and centralized online health record framework for the public sector by incorporating the entire levels of healthcare system. 23 This transformation can set out easy retrieval of complete data of a patient irrespective of where they seek treatment, thereby bestowing maximum care.",
