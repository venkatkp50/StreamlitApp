Coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) primarily affects the respiratory tract and can lead to severe respiratory illness [1, 2] . SARS-CoV-2 virus encephalitis also has been described [3, 4] . Unsurprisingly, SIADH-related hyponatremia has been identified in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 [5] [6] [7] . Observational studies have noted an association between interleukin (IL)-6 levels and hyponatremia and suggest that IL-6-mediated inflammation and non-osmotic antidiuretic hormone (ADH) release is the underlying pathophysiology [7, 8] . Given that brain imaging was normal in our patient, we ruled out direct CNS involvement with SARS-CoV-2 as a cause of encephalopathy. Therefore, the present report is of a case of hyponatremia and encephalopathy due to SIADH as the main presentation of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in a 55-year-old woman.",

There was no prior history of headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, shortness of breath, or chest pain, nor any recent change in medications or current diuretic use. On arrival at the ED, the patient was febrile with a temperature of 38.5\u00baC and tachycardic with a regular heart rate of 120 bpm. Her blood pressure was 159/81 mmHg, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. Physical examination revealed no focal neurological deficits. There was no edema or orthostatic hypotension, the patient's mucous membranes were moist, and she was found to be euvolemic. Laboratory findings were significant for a low sodium level of 116 mEq/L (reference range, 135-145 mEq/L), normal blood urea nitrogen level of 15.0 mg/dL (reference range, 7-20 mg/dL), and normal creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL (reference range, 0.5-1.2 mg/dL). A random blood glucose level was 324 mg/dL (reference range, 70-90 mg/dL). The serum uric acid level was decreased to 1.6 mg/dL (reference range, 2.5-6.2 mg/dL). Urine osmolarity was 364 mOsm/kg, urinary sodium was 69 mEq/L (reference range, 30.0-90.0 mEq/L), urinary potassium was 15.6 mEq/L, and serum osmolarity was 251 mOsm/kg (reference range, 285-295 mOsm/kg). The patient's thyroid-stimulating hormone level was normal at 1.1 mIU/L (reference range, 0.465-4.680 mIU/L) and her morning cortisol level was normal at 16.7 \u00b5g/dL (reference range, 4.46-22.70 \u00b5g/dL).

SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed from a nasopharyngeal sample with a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test (Abbott, Brooklyn, New York, United States) performed in an accredited LabCorp laboratory in Brooklyn, New York. Because the patient was febrile, a lumbar puncture (LP) was performed. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear. Other than an elevated opening pressure of 26 mmHg, biochemical and cellular analysis of the CSF was noted to be within normal limits, including a protein level of 44 mg/dL (reference range, 12-60 mg/dL) and a white blood cell count of 1 cell/\u00b5L (reference range, 0.0-5.0 cells/\u00b5L). CSF cultures and PCR testing to identify bacterial or viral infections were negative. Based on the previous data, we concluded that the patient had SIADH associated with COVID-19. Because of the altered sensorium, initial management was administration of 3% hypertonic saline on Day 1, which led to improvement in the serum sodium level to 120 mEq/L over the first 24 hours, followed by salt tablets and fluid restriction. We did not use urea or tolvaptan. The patient's neurological symptoms started to improve within 24 hours of presentation, in parallel with her improving serum sodium levels. She did not require any specific treatment for COVID-19. The patient was discharged home on a regular salt diet, no fluid restriction, and previous home medications. Her sodium level was 131 mEq/L at discharge and 136 mEq/L at the 2-week follow-up visit.",

Also, a large, retrospective study reported a 30% incidence of hyponatremia, with 1% of the cases being severe, in 4452 hospitalized patients who were SARS-CoV-2 PCRpositive [7] . Among the patients with severe hyponatremia, the cause of low serum sodium was identified to be equally divided between hypovolemia and SIADH [7] . However, the study did not provide specific data regarding the presence or absence of clinical symptomatology in the lungs or CNS, or from related imaging. The study found an inverse association between IL-6 and sodium levels and implicated inflammation-associated non-osmotic ADH release as the cause of SIADH in COVID-19. This association of elevated IL6 and ADH levels has been previously described [8, 12] . Although we did not obtain IL-6 levels in our patient, her ferritin level was noted to be elevated at 332 ng/mL (reference range, 11.10-264 ng/mL). However, no features of \"cytokine storm,\" including endothelial damage and multiorgan failure, were seen [13] . Moreover, our patient had no pulmonary symptoms, and chest imaging was negative. Her presenting symptoms were solely neurological in the setting of acute hyponatremia.",

Coagulopathy associated with COVID-19 also has been implicated as a cause of ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes [4] . Brain imaging, including MRI and CT angiography, revealed no such changes in our patient. LP, done to evaluate the cause of encephalopathy, revealed elevated opening pressures, but CSF studies, including cell counts, cultures, and PCR tests to identify bacterial or viral infections, were negative. These results essentially ruled out direct CNS involvement by SARS-CoV-2. Hence, we concluded that the encephalopathy was related to hyponatremia, rather than CNS disease or a CNS complication of COVID-19. We did not repeat brain imaging because there was rapid improvement in the patient's neurological symptoms that corresponded with the correction in serum sodium levels. Patients with severe hyponatremia (<120 mEq/L) can present with manifestations of cerebral edema, including obtundation, seizures, coma, respiratory arrest, and death [16] . Numerous published case reports about SARS-CoV-2-related neurological manifestations describe findings such as altered mental status, seizures, and cerebrovascular events [17] . These findings are not specific to COVID-19 infection and the real impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the CNS is unclear [17] .",
