Current GPS methods allow estimation of the dose-response relationship between a single continuous exposure and an outcome. However, in many real-world settings, there are multiple exposures occurring simultaneously that could be causally related to the outcome. We propose a multivariate GPS method (mvGPS) that allows estimation of a dose-response surface that relates the joint distribution of multiple continuous exposure variables to an outcome. The method involves generating weights under a multivariate normality assumption on the exposure variables. Focusing on scenarios with two exposure variables, we show via simulation that the mvGPS method can achieve balance across sets of confounders that may differ for different exposure variables and reduces bias of the treatment effect estimates under a variety of data generating scenarios. We apply the mvGPS method to an analysis of the joint effect of two types of intervention strategies to reduce childhood obesity rates.",

Techniques such as propensity score methods can help to remove sources of potential confounding and return valid estimates of the treatment effect [39] . Propensity score methods were first developed for binary treatments, and then extended to categorical, or multiple, treatments, which introduced the term \"generalized propensity score\" (GPS) [21] . In the context of a categorical treatment variable, the GPS corresponds to the conditional probability of receiving a particular treatment given a set of confounders. Following the extension to categorical treatments, the GPS was adapted to the setting of continuous exposures via the use of conditional densities [16, 20] .",

Other methods focus on the use of weights [37] , including incorporating covariate balancing properties in estimation using a penalized likelihood approach [10] or constrained optimization on the entropy of the weights [45, 49] .

In medicine, combination therapies, which involve the patient taking several medi-cations simultaneously, have been shown to be effective for treating Crohn's disease [6] , cancer [22] , hypertension [13] , and HIV [34] . Typical methods for estimation of the dose response surface for combination treatments requires careful design with repeated randomized experiments in order to estimate the optimal combination of treatment doses [25] . When such experimentation is not feasible, researchers may wish to use available data from observational or non-randomized studies to estimate the joint effects. For example, there is currently interest in studying potential combination therapies for COVID-19 using available data from non-randomized studies. However, determining a potentially beneficial dose of several medications may be complicated due to confounding by patient demographic characteristics, comorbities or other factors [11, 12, 43, 44] .",

While WIC offers many regular services, primarily food assistance and nutrition education that are uniform from clinic to clinic, WIC agencies can also receive additional funding to implement intervention programs. These programs are implemented non-randomly at clinics due to differences in community needs and other considerations. Our motivating example focuses on WIC intervention programs implemented in 2010-2016, given that a major change in the WIC food package occurred in 2009 that may have altered family behaviors and neighborhood food environments [15, 47] .",

Information about each program was obtained, including how it was implemented, the estimated reach in terms of client participation, which clinics participated, and how long the program was active. These exposures were mapped to census tracts where WIC participating children live by identifying the implementing WIC clinics and then defining a catchment area around the clinic intended to capture the exposed population. Catchment areas were defined for each clinic using records of client attendance, and varied by strategy type (macro vs. micro). Children living in census tracts that fell within a catchment area were assumed to be exposed. Exposure values at census tracts were then aggregated across programs by strategy and by year to obtain a single continuous dose for each of the nine intervention strategies. Strategy-specific doses were then summed into macro and micro intervention doses, which were log transformed due to skewness. More details about the dose construction procedure are provided in a forthcoming paper. Figure 1 shows the resultant joint distribution of macro and micro intervention dose for the WIC intervention programs averaged over our defined intervention period, 2010-2016. Each point in the figure represents a census tract. WICparticipating children residing in a particular census tract were presumed to receive the calculated doses.",

The entropy balancing method uses non-parametric constrained optimization with an entropy loss function to solve for weights without specifying a propensity score model. CBGPS attempts to achieve propensity specification and covariate balance simultaneously by introducing a penalty term into the likelihood. The PS method uses univariate normal densities for the marginal distribution of exposure and the generalized propensity score without balance constraints. Although these univariate methods can handle only single exposure variables, we expected that they might perform adequately when the multiple exposure variables are highly correlated and have the same confounders.

In M1, the two exposures D 1 and D 2 each have five covariates, with none in common; for each exposure, two of the covariates are true confounders (i.e., also associated with Y ). The outcome Y is a function of the two exposures as well as the four true confounders, none of which are shared between D 1 and D 2 . In M2, D 1 and D 2 again have five covariates each, but they share three in common. Two of the shared covariates are true confounders, and each exposure has a confounder that is not shared with the other exposure. The outcome Y is again a function of the two exposures and the four true confounders, two of which are shared and two of which are not. In M3, D 1 and D 2 share the same five covariates. Four of these are true confounders, and Y is a function of the two exposures and four common confounders.

For example, for Scenario M1, weights were constructed for D 1 using X 2 and X 4 while D 2 depended on X 6 and X 9 (see Table 2 ). The three univariate methods, entropy balancing, CBGPS and PS, were implemented using the WeightIt package in R [14] . The parametric version of CBGPS was used. The mvGPS method was implemented using the mvGPS package in R. All methods were compared against an unweighted approach equivalent to applying a weight of 1 to all observations. Weighted Pearson correlations between the exposures and confounders were used to assess balancing performance [2, 54] . We examined maximum absolute correlation, which reflects the most imbalanced confounder after weighting and has been shown to be a key metric to assess balance [8] , and the average absolute correlation, which summarizes how well balance is achieved over all confounders. These correlation values were taken over both sets of exposures.",

            "text": "All methods reduce the effective sample size when weights are applied to the sample. Of particular concern for practitioners are extreme weights. When sample sizes are small or moderate, extreme weights can have an outsized influence. They may also result in limited power to detect treatment effects and erratic estimation [23] . One remedy is to trim extreme weights [18, 28] . As all simulations were run with moderate sample sizes, i.e., n = 200, we wanted to test performance when weight trimming was applied as might be done in practice by analysts when faced with extreme weights. Our simulation analyses were thus repeated using trimmed weights for each method, w q , where q \u2208 {0.99, 0.95}. Weights were trimmed at both the upper and lower bounds of the respective sample percentile such that values above or below the thresholds were replaced with the threshold value. Figure 4 plots the absolute maximum correlation between the exposures and confounders for each method along with the original unweighted correlations for comparison. In general, with no common confounding or partially common confounding, the mvGPS method substantially outperformed each univariate method. However, for common founding, mvGPS performs best only when the marginal correlation is low. The performance of univariate methods tended to cluster differently based on the degree of confounding overlap. In models with low overlap, performance was clustered based on exposure, D 1 or D 2 , but as the degree of overlap increased, performance became clustered by type of estimation, Entropy, CBGPS, or PS. Applying trimmed weights, we see a slight improvement for q = 0.99 while q = 0.95 has little to no effect. Figure 5 shows the average absolute exposure-covariate correlation along with a reference line at 0.1, a benchmark suggesting sufficient covariate balance [54] . For all simulation models, the mvGPS is consistently near the 0.1 threshold. For the univariate methods, we see trends in performance similar to those observed for the maximum correlation, but differences between methods are smaller. Entropy methods consistently had the lowest average correlation, especially with high overlap or high marginal correlation. Trimming the weights tended to eliminate the effect of the marginal correlation on the mvGPS, resulting in flatter lines for q = 0.99 and q = 0.95, particularly for models with at least some common confounding. Figure 6 displays trends in effective sample size for each method across the various simulation scenarios, with a reference line at 100, which is often a minimum desirable quantity for inference in the dose-response model [49] . The mvGPS method tends to have lower effective sample sizes compared to the univariate methods. Importantly, using untrimmed weights, the mvGPS method has effective sample sizes less than 100 in the presence of partial or common confounding, indicating particularly low power. Trimming the weights increases the effective sample size for all methods and the difference between methods decreases as q increases. Figure 7 shows the results of each method with respect to total absolute bias for the treatment effects estimated from weighted regression. Generally, the mvGPS method has the lowest total bias, with the exception of high correlation in the model with partially common confounding or no common confounding. Of particular note, although the effective sample size and balancing diagnostics were lower for mvGPS in the common confounding model, it significantly outperforms all univariate methods with respect to bias even with high marginal correlation. We also observe that certain univariate methods have greater bias than the unweighted estimates, such as those that estimate weights using D 2 for the common confounding model. Trimming the weights tended to reduce bias for mvGPS when there was high correlation of the exposures, particularly under models with either partially overlapping confounding or no common confounding, while slightly increasing the bias for the common confounding models. Figure 8 shows the root mean squared error based on 500 points sampled along a grid from the convex hull, H q , of the exposures. The precision of predicted values for the mvGPS is often worse than that for univariate methods. As \u03c1 increases, the mvGPS method has worse performance, with decreased power from low effective sample sizes. Trimming the weights helps reduce this trend and reduces the root mean squared error across all methods.",

The multivariate method protects against any single confounder being strongly imbalanced across either exposure at the expense of slightly lower average balance, while the univariate methods have potentially large imbalance on the unused exposure dimension. The notable exception is when there is high overlap in terms of confounders. In this case univariate methods can sufficiently balance confounders, particularly when the marginal correlation of exposures is high. However, despite achieving balance in these scenarios, the univariate methods still resulted in high total bias of the treatment effect estimates. Although mvGPS weights were advantageous with respect to balance and bias, they tend to produce smaller effective sample sizes, resulting in lower power and higher root mean squared error. Weight trimming, particularly with q = 0.99, offers a potential remedy to reduce these effects while also maintaining balance and low bias.",

The rapid increase in childhood obesity rates in the early 2000s led to interventions to increase physical activity, and improve access to healthy food especially in communities where affordable fresh produce is not available. In this motivating example, we estimated the causal effects of interventions that were implemented by individual WIC clinics in attempts to meet the specific needs of the communities they served. As discussed in Section 2, the intervention programs were classified as using macro or micro strategies and we calculated two continuous dose measures for n = 1079 census tracts. The outcome was the difference in average obesity prevalence from post, 2012-2016, to pre, 2007-2009, intervention period, calculated as Y =p post \u2212p pre at the census tract level. Negative values of Y indicate that the prevalence of obesity decreased. We hypothesized that areas with more macro and micro strategies would have the greatest reduction in rates of obesity.",

WIC administrative data were used to calculate average pre-treatment overweight and obesity prevalence for each census tract. Overweight and obesity prevalence were considered potential confounders because agencies may have directed interventions towards clinics in higher prevalence regions. Finally, NETS provided information on neighborhood food environments, specifically on the density per square mile of unhealthy and healthy food outlets [1, 53] . Previous analysis has shown that higher density of healthy outlets was associated with lower obesity prevalence among low-income preschool-aged children in Los Angeles County [4] . Both macro and micro propensity dose equations included the same set of potential confounders from these three data sources, but each exposure was assessed separately to determine if higher order polynomial terms for any confounders were needed. These analyses showed that both macro and micro dose had quadratic relationships with education level and density of food outlets, while only macro dose had evidence of a quadratic relationship with median household income.",

The marginal correlation of exposures was moderate, r = 0.28, in this highdensity region. As both exposures had nearly identical sets of potential confounders, the data generating mechanism was akin to the common confounding scenario described in the simulations. Therefore, to protect against extreme weights and reduce the variability of the resulting dose-response estimates, weights for each method were trimmed using q = 0.99. Table 5 shows the balancing diagnostics, maximum absolute correlation and average absolute correlation, and the effective sample sizes. The confounders were significantly imbalanced prior to weighting with the average absolute correlation above 0.2 and the maximum absolute correlation above 0.4. All methods were able to improve balance, but the mvGPS method had substantially greater reduction in imbalance than the univariate methods. The average absolute correlation and maximum absolute correlation were reduced to 0.04 and 0.10 respectively after applying mvGPS weights. The effective sample size for mvGPS was reduced from the original sample of n = 1079 to 604.

Only exposures within the trimmed convex hull, H 0.95 , were used to estimate treatment effects and predict the dose-response surface. The dose-response model for both methods included linear terms for each exposure and an interaction between the two exposures. Figure 9 shows the weighted and unweighted dose-response surfaces along with a reference plane of no change in obesity prevalence. Both the weighted and unweighted surfaces suggest reductions in obesity prevalence from our pre-intervention period, 2007-2009, to the post-intervention period, 2012-2016, for all dose combinations. This is consistent with studies showing a decrease in obesity risk among WIC-participating children in Los Angeles County associated with the 2009 change in the WIC food packages [3, 33] . The unweighted dose-response surface is a monotonic plane; increases in micro dose and in macro dose are each associated with greater reduction in obesity prevalence, the associations are additive, and the greatest reduction in prevalence corresponds to the highest levels of macro and micro doses. The mvGPS dose-response surface is more complex and shows an interaction effect. At low levels of macro dose, increases in micro dose are associated with a steep reduction in obesity prevalence. However, as macro dose increases, high micro dose becomes gradually less effective. In the quadrant where both macro and micro dose are high, higher micro doses appear to be less beneficial rather than more beneficial. There are several possible explanations for this result. There could be important confounders that were not accounted for in the analysis. There could also have been measurement error in estimating exposures. We noted that the data set included several observations with high macro and high micro doses that were assigned high weights and had either no decrease or a slight increase in child obesity prevalence. Further investigation of these census tracts may yield more information and guide model refinements.",

The simulations identified two key factors that affect performance. When the exposures have highly overlapping sets of confounders or large marginal correlation, the mvGPS method may generate extreme weights, resulting in smaller effective sample sizes and higher average root mean squared error. Trimming the weights improves performance in these situations.

Further work is needed to explore performance for settings with more than two exposures.

Due to nonrandom selection of participating clinics, there was significant imbalance on potential confounders as evidenced by large absolute maximum and average correlations prior to weighting. The mvGPS method achieved superior balance compared to univariate alternatives, reducing the maximum absolute correlation to the benchmark of 0.1 and the average absolute correlation to nearly zero. Estimates of the dose-response surface using weights from the mvGPS method differed substantially from the results of the unweighted surface. The results showed that the most effective intervention combination was higher levels of micro strategies and lower levels of macro strategies. However, our results should be interpreted with caution. As with other causal inference methods, all confounders must be adequately captured and modeled to produce unbiased estimates. Thus our estimated treatment effects may be biased due to unknown confounders. In particular, communities that received higher levels of macro and micro doses may have been inherently more difficult to change due to a complex interplay of community and personal factors not captured by our set of potential confounders. In addition, we have assumed that the potential outcomes of the change in obesity given macro and micro exposures are well-defined via SUTVA as discussed in Section 3.2. Specifically, SUTVA stipulates that multiple versions of the exposures do not exist. In our application, however, there are potentially different sets of interventions that can yield the same macro and micro exposure scores. In the presence of multiple versions of the exposures, the resulting potential outcomes may be unidentifiable. Further, we had to estimate exposure to the interventions at the census tract level using various assumptions, which may have resulted in measurement error.

We note that it is common practice when using the generalized propensity score for continuous treatments in the univariate case to assume normality [10, 16, 20, 37, 54] . However, this reliance on multivariate normality is an important limitation of the methodology, particularly in assessing its validity [29] .

Assessing balance and effective sample size (ESS) using various weighted methods for the motivating example. Data used for estimating weights were restricted to H 0.95 . The univariate methods were applied separately to the two exposure metrics, macro or micro dose. The correlations are taken over both exposure metrics. The unweighted method represents the original values before applying weights. The weights for each method are trimmed using q = 0.99. Directed acyclic graphs for each of the three data generating simulation scenarios. D 1 and D 2 are continuous exposure measures and Y is the outcome of interest. C 1 and C 2 represent confounder sets that are specific to exposures D 1 and D 2 , while C 12 represents a confounder set common to both exposures. Rows correspond to the three simulation scenarios, M1, M2 and M3, and each column corresponds to quantiles used for weight trimming. The y-axis is the average effective sample size, (\u03a3 i w i ) 2 /\u03a3 i w 2 i , for n = 200 from B = 1000 repetitions. The x-axis, \u03c1, is the marginal correlation of the exposures. The red line corresponds to an effective sample size of 100 which is often a minimum desirable quantity for hypothesis testing and inference of the dose-response model. Rows correspond to the three simulation scenarios, M1, M2 and M3, and each column corresponds to quantiles used for weight trimming. The y-axis is the average total absolute bias, \u03a3 j |\u03b1 Dj \u2212\u03b1 Dj |, for n = 200 from B = 1000 repetitions. The x-axis, \u03c1, is the marginal correlation of the exposures. For univariate methods, weights were generated twice, once for each exposure variable. Rows correspond to the three simulation scenarios, M1, M2 and M3, and each column corresponds to quantiles used for weight trimming. The y-axis is the average root mean squared error (RMSE) for 500 points sampled on a convex hull H q grid for n = 200 from B = 1000 repetitions. The x-axis, \u03c1, is the marginal correlation of the exposures. For univariate methods, weights were generated twice, once for each exposure variable. Estimated dose-response surface of change in obesity prevalence as a function of log macro and micro dose, obtained using mvGPS weights and unweighted. The surface is restricted to the convex hull of observed bivariate exposure, H 0.95 , shown in Figure 1 and points are sampled evenly along this grid. A reference plane of no change is included.
