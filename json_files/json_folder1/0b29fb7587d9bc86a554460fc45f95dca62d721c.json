Of the 8470 unique proteins identified, high similarity was observed between CHO-S and CHO DG44 and included increases in proteins involved in DNA replication, cell cycle, RNA processing, and chromosome processing. Alternatively, gene ontology and pathway analysis in tissues indicated increased protein intensities related to important tissue functionalities. Proteins enriched in the brain included those involved in acidic amino acid metabolism, Golgi apparatus, and ion and phospholipid transport. The lung showed enrichment in proteins involved in BCAA catabolism, ROS metabolism, vesicle trafficking, and lipid synthesis while the ovary exhibited enrichments in extracellular matrix and adhesion proteins. The heart proteome included vasoconstriction, complement activation, and lipoprotein metabolism enrichments. These detailed comparisons of CHO cell lines and hamster tissues will enhance understanding of the relationship between proteins and tissue function and pinpoint potential pathways of biotechnological relevance for future cell engineering.",

            "text": "The history of CHO cell line establishment from Cricetulus griseus dates back to the 1950s when Theodore T. Puck and colleagues established the CHO-K1 cell line 1 . Today, CHO cell lines generated from the Chinese hamster dominate the biopharmaceutical industry and their products generate billions of dollars in revenue annually 2,3 . The success of CHO cell lines for recombinant protein production can be attributed to their high growth rate, ease of genetic modification, and ability to post-translationally modify proteins via glycosylation, including galactosylation and sialylation. The original CHO cell line was adapted and modified by various researchers to create cell lines, such as CHO-DXB11, CHO DG44, and CHO-S 4,5 . Thus, there may be genetic differences across CHO parental cell lines, as well as clonal-and process-dependent variations 2 . These clonal variabilities may potentially lead to differences across transcriptomes and proteomes. Since each and every CHO cell line exhibits significant genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic signatures, a single CHO-ome is not necessarily directly applicable across different laboratories. In addition to cell line differences, variations in the bioprocess conditions, including media formulations and bioreactor operations, can alter the transcriptome and proteome.",

Hamsters represent another important small animal model in biomedicine for studying diseases and evaluating the effect of potential therapies in pharmaceutical sciences. Indeed, Chinese hamsters have been applied as a small animal model for diabetes, cancer, and the impact of radiation 18-21 . More recently, hamster species represent one of the prime small animal models for examining the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infections and potential therapies 22 . Understanding the proteomics profiles across different tissues will help biomedical scientists to understand how expressed proteins are responsible for tissue-specific functionalities. From a disease perspective, tissue proteomics can enable scientists to appreciate why different diseases and drugs affect various tissues differently. From a biotechnology perspective, specific functionalities present in different tissues can provide insights into ways to improve the capabilities of CHO cell line production hosts by adding capabilities present in certain tissues that may be distinct from current hosts.",

The CHO-S and CHO DG44 cell lines were used as model cell lines for comparison to hamster tissue expression patterns. Multiple organs (brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, ovary and spleen) relevant to pharmaceutical sciences, disease, and biotechnology were used to generate tissue-specific proteomes, providing the most comprehensive and diverse tissue proteome available for hamsters to date. Tissue-tissue and tissue-cell line comparisons suggest functions and pathways with significant differential expression across different cell types, with cell lines tending to upregulate proteins associated with growth and gene expression, while tissue samples exhibit upregulation in tissuespecific functional pathways. Examining proteins in CHO cell lines and tissues will enhance our understanding of why tissue exhibit certain characteristics, how cell lines are adapted for cell culture and protein production, and highlight how CHO cells could potentially be modified to include useful tissue-specific functions in future cell engineering efforts.",

Specifically, we included technical and biological replicates of CHO-S (two samples in TMT 1 and one sample in TMT 2) to aid in comparisons between and within the TMT experiments. All other samples contained only biological replicates, which were randomly assigned to one of the TMT-10plex kits. The TMT labeling design is provided in Table 1 . Following protein digestion, TMT reagents were thawed, and acetonitrile was used to dissolve the reagents. One reagent tube was added to each sample and then incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Hydroxylamine was subsequently added to quench the reaction before the tubes were combined. All TMT labeled samples were combined and vacuum centrifuged to dryness, removing the entire liquid. Each TMT-10plex was subjected to analysis by two-dimensional liquid chromatography tandem MS (2D LC/MS/MS). Protein identifications were made using Proteome Discoverer software with a high confidence cutoff [< 1% false discovery rate (FDR)].

Additionally, since CHO is the dominant biopharmaceutical production host in biotechnology, this comparison elucidates similarities and differences across cells and tissues. An overview of the proteomics workflow is shown in Fig. 1B . Following MS identification, the protein accession numbers were determined using the annotated Chinese hamster genome 25 . Protein accession numbers were converted to gene symbols for functional analysis 26 . For missing gene symbols, the accession numbers were searched against mouse and human databases using the online database, bioDBnet 26 . In this study, gene ontology (GO) and ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) were used for functional analyses of the differentially expressed proteins. GO analysis converts gene symbols to their molecular function, cellular component, and biological processes in order to evaluate the relationship between the molecular activities of gene products, location of activity, and pathways comprising the activity of multiple gene products, respectively 27 . In another functional analysis, each gene symbol was mapped to the relevant IPA pathways 28 , suggesting enriched and depleted pathways for comparisons between different tissues and cells. For both GO and IPA, the enrichment and depletion values were determined based on p-values that were calculated via the hypergeometric distribution, with p < 0.05 set for evaluating significance.",

We identified 178 proteins with significantly higher expression in CHO-S relative to CHO-DG44 and 155 proteins with significantly higher expression in CHO DG44 relative to CHO-S, representing the lowest number of total outliers for any comparison. A comparison between cells and tissues is shown in Fig. 3B through I. For these comparisons, the total number of proteins with low and high expression (fold change < 0.5 or > 2.0, respectively) is approximately 50%. For the cell to tissue comparison, all tissues show a statistically significant difference as compared to either the CHO-S or CHO DG44 cell lines. The proteins expressed at significantly higher levels in cells over tissues include proteins related to DNA replication, transcription, translation, and controlling cell apoptosis as expected to maintain rapid cell growth in exponential culture. Among the most highly expressed proteins in CHO-S and CHO DG44 are DNA-directed RNA polymerase II, eukaryotic translation initiation factor, histone H3.1t, general transcription factor 3C, 60S ribosomal protein, and apoptosis inhibitor 5. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ In comparison to ovary tissue (Fig. 3E ,I respectively, p < 0.01), CHO-S and CHO DG44 cells exhibited differences in expression patterns. This is somewhat surprising considering that CHO cells were derived from a mixture of ovary and the surrounding connective tissue. In Fig. 3E ,I, the proteins colored blue and yellow represent those with higher expression in ovary or CHO cells, respectively. In addition to ovary, statistical differences in protein expression were observed for CHO-S and CHO DG44 cells and to lung tissue (Fig. 3D,H, p < 0.01) . Similar to the comparison against ovary, an increase in upregulated proteins with higher expression was observed in the lung tissue in comparison to the cell lines. This suggests that tissue-specific functions may contribute to differences in expression patterns with cells regardless of the type of tissue.",

Similar to the ovary and lung comparison, there are a greater number of proteins with higher expression in the heart tissue when compared to cell lines. Over 50% of the cells in the heart are cardiac fibroblasts, which contributes to the specificity of this organ 34 . In addition, the heart has endothelial, smooth muscle, and pacemaker cells. This high degree of specialization is likely influential for the differences in proteins between CHO and heart. Finally, both CHO-S and CHO DG44 also show a difference in expression www.nature.com/scientificreports/ when compared to the brain, which is also likely related to the high degree of specialization required for brain cells such as neurons and glia (Fig. 3B ,F, p < 0.01). Amongst the tissues, wide differential regulation, both upregulation and downregulation, can be observed when comparing tissues against each other (Fig. 3J-O) . There is a greater difference in terms of the total percentage of outliers in the brain versus heart comparison (~ 62% total outliers for brain and ~ 51% total outliers for heart). Interestingly, only brain and heart tissues were found to have a statistically significant difference between each other (Table 3 ). All other tissue to tissue comparisons were found to have insignificant differences in the percentage of outliers. One reason for the relatively high number of outliers in brain tissue may be attributed to the distinct separation in terms of embryonic development from the other organs. The brain originates from the ectoderm whereas the circulatory system (heart), epithelial layer of the lungs, and ovary develop from the Table 2 ) are provided in the appendix. We also examined some of the top upregulated proteins in each tissue.

Means comparison using Student's t-test for total percentage of outliers. *p-value < 0.05 indicates that the outlier comparison is statistically significant. Coloring is shown from low (green) to high (pink) abundance. Distinct clusters are shown for brain, lung, heart, and ovary tissues. From top to bottom: the protein functions exhibiting high expression for each tissue are shown relative to other tissues for ovary (A), brain (B), heart (C), and lung (D) plotted using Genesis software. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ for each specific tissue. For each sample, the top 200 upregulated proteins, corresponding to approximately 3% of the total proteins in a tissue, were identified in order to highlight tissue specificity (Supplementary Table 3 ). For example, disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing proteins (ADAM7, 10, 15) were highly upregulated in hamster ovary (Supplementary Table 3 ). Indeed, ADAM 10 can control follicle formation by regulating the recruitment of ovarian follicle supporting cells 36 . Disintegrin would be useful for control of the extracellular matrix as agrees with results from the human ovary-specific proteome 37 . Similarly, highly upregulated brain proteins include amyloid beta A4 protein, neuron navigator 1 (NAV1), calcium and integrin binding protein, and serine/threonine protein kinase (Supplementary Table 3 ). NAV1 is specifically targeted to the nervous system 38 .",

Enriched brain biological processes relative to the CHO cell lines include ion transport, axon guidance, www.nature.com/scientificreports/ synaptic transmission, and metabolic process, among others 27 . Ion transport helps to maintain the stability of cerebral function due to the key roles that ions play in currents and synaptic transmission 53 . Abnormal distributions of ions in the brain can lead to defects in neuronal function including seizures and depression. Enriched biological processes in the heart compared to the CHO cell lines show functions related to circulation and heart function such as vasoconstriction, sodium-independent organic ion transport, complement activation, blood coagulation, and lipoprotein metabolism. For example, complement activation involves mannosebinding lectin and complement components, C3, C5, and CD59. The complement cascade can be activated during heart disease or failure, especially in cases of myocardial ischemia and reperfusion 54, 55 . Biological processes that are enriched in the lung as compared to the CHO cell lines include G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway, innate immune response, vesicle-mediated and transmembrane transport, and signal transduction. Indeed, vesicle transport is an important component of secretory pathway machinery. Unraveling the complexities of lung secretions may yield new insights into ways by which secretion differs in tissues and cell lines. Signaling through G-protein coupled receptors and other pathways is an important proinflammatory response in lungs, which can undergo modifications leading to lung cancers 56, 57 . Not surprisingly, protection of the lungs using the host innate immune response is critical as this organ is exposed to a variety of pathogens including bacterial, fungal, and viral, during breathing 58, 59 .",

Enriched ovarian biological processes include transmembrane transport, protein transport, vesicle-mediated transport, cell adhesion, and cell death. When vesicle production rate was quantified in the ovary, the turnover indicated high vesicle recycling across the endomembrane system 59 , which is consistent with these proteomic results. Cell adhesion is also important to ovary function and follicle maturation through interactions with the extracellular matrix and direct cell-cell contacts. Mutation of the ovarian surface is causative of approximately 90% of malignant ovarian tumors 60,61 .",

These differences highlight the role of tissues in executing key organ functions which require a specific metabolic processes, such as transport and communication, in comparison to CHO cells, which are focused on replication and gene expression, characteristics useful for rapid growth and the production of biologics. Because of their relevance to biomedicine and the biotechnology industry, we compared the tissue proteome to CHO cell lines and each other in order to identify functional differences in expression across tissues and cell lines. Specifically, we observed enrichment of many physiological pathways in tissues that were not enriched in cells, such as ion, protein, and vesicle transport, signal transduction, and cell adhesion. Often, these differences correlated with specific tissue functions while the activities in cell lines were often correlated with DNA replication, cell cycle, or RNA processing. Furthermore, some of the proteins with high expression in lung, ovary, or other tissues versus CHO, such as vesicle-mediated and protein transport, provide significant opportunities for CHO cell engineering going forward. In this way, the study expands on our CHO and Chinese hamster tissue knowledge base by virtue of establishing an atlas to differentiate proteins across cells and tissue for this critically important biotechnological and biomedical host species. Indeed, this comparison has enabled us to appreciate the changing proteomic landscape across cells and tissues and furthermore to recognize how the expressed proteins from different cell types can represent signatures for some of their key physiological or biotechnological functions.",

Peptides were labeled and combined into two TMT 10-plex experiments for fractionation and mass spectrometry identification. In the bioinformatics analysis pipeline, peptides were matched to proteins and gene symbols for functional analysis in order to understand cell and tissue metabolism.
