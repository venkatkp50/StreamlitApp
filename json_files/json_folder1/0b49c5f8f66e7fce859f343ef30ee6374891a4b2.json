Samples were collected from initial visit and for 6 months follow up. Presence of serum IgG and IgA against SARS-CoV-2 antigens (S1-spike, nucleocapsid and NSP3) were analyzed. Nasal swabs were tested for presence of IgA against the outer envelope S1 spike protein. Ninety-two percent of participants were seropositive against SARS-CoV-2 recombinant proteins at day 28 from study entry and all (100%) were seropositive from samples collected at 2 months or later. The most common antibody responses (both serum IgG, mainly IgG1 and IgA) were detected against the S1-spike protein and the nucleoprotein. In samples collected from nasal tissues considerably lower frequencies of IgA-positive reactivities were detected. Sixteen to 18 percent of study participants showed detectable IgA levels in nasal samples, except at day 60 when 36% of tested individuals showed presence of IgA against the S1-spike protein. The study suggests that the absolute majority of studied naturally infected Covid-19 patient in the Linkoping, Ostergotland health region develop over 6 months lasting detectable levels of serum IgG and IgA responses towards the SARS-CoV-2 S1-spike protein as well as against the nucleoprotein, but not against the non-structural protein 3.",

In most viral vaccine trials, in the childhood vaccination programmes (1-3) as well as in adult vaccination the humoral immunity is evaluated, and most often correlated with disease severity reduction or prevention. For respiratory tract infections such as influenza and RSV this is well documented (4) (5) (6) . It is thus very likely so also with the Covid-19 infectious virus, the betacoronavirus SARS CoV-2 (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) 12) . And this is the reason for conducting this study. The aim of this study is to follow a significant size of hospitalized Covid-19 patients from hospital admission and follow up to determine the longevity of the humoral immunity in blood and respiratory tract.",

In this study all involved patients developed detectable anti-S1binding IgG and IgA responses at least once during the study period. Ninety-six percent of the study participants were seropositive at 6 months. All showed presence of both serum IgG (IgG1) and IgA, and in a subgroup also local mucosal nasopharyngeal sIgA against the outer surface proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 for upto 2 months follow-up. It is of importance that the serum IgG against neutralizing viral proteins remain elevated, and hopefully at a protective level, even though no clear antibody-titer or antibody quantity limit on correlation from infection or reduced transmissibility have been determined yet. Similarly, it was valuable to see that also serum IgG against the nucleoprotein was frequent among the infected patients. However, serum IgG/IgA against the NC-proteins have been described as both negative and positive for human health as described in different patient categories. In one study higher amounts of these immunoglobulins correlate with antibodydependent enhancement (ADE) of infection, even though no clear mechanistic process was presented (14) , and in other studies these antibodies have been part of the cure/health promoting immune response. The possible positive interpretations or explanations given would be the clearance of circulating viral proteins that otherwise may cause formation of immune complexes, or result in inflammation at local sites where the NC-proteins aggregate (15) .",

            "text": "Still, it is important to identify the correlates of protective immunity, and sofar the best and most often defined correlate in almost any respiratory infectious illness have been antibodies (17) . Antibodies have been shown to neutralize infectivity by attaching to viral surface proteins, and in addition to neutralization to trigger complement-activation and provide antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity against infected viruses and cells. There are few reasons yet to believe that the SARS-CoV-2 will not be sensitive to the same correlates of protection (18, 19, 20) . The challenge will be to obtain antibodies capable of recognizing the new circulating S1-envelope protein mutant SARS-CoV-2 strains, especially close to the nasal mucosal surfaces as seen in a subpopulation (Fig.3) here. The possibly positive result with obtaining the SARS-CoV-2 specific immunity through natural infection may be the broader immune responses towards several viral proteins, several that are not included in the vaccines. Immune memory B-and T-lymphocytes will thus be obtained both against the viral surface proteins and several hopefully more conserved intraviral proteins such as the nucleo-proteins (N) and the non-structural proteins (nsp:s). The question is just to understand the longevity and the magnitude of these immune responses in Covid-19 patients with mild and/or severe disease as well as in the SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated individuals of different age groups and genders.",
