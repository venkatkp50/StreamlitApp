We calculated the COVID-19 incidence %, daily reproduction number, and mortality %, then estimated the associations with urban environment indicators using regression models. COVID-19 outcomes were generally highest in areas with high population density, and this pattern was evident in the early period of epidemic. Among the area-level demographic variables, the percentage of Black or Hispanic residents showed the strongest positive association with COVID-19 outcomes. Higher risk of COVID-19 outcomes was also associated with higher percentage of overcrowded households, uninsured people, and income inequality. The percent elderly, sex ratio (the ratio of males to females), and greenness were negatively associated with risk of COVID-19 outcomes. The results of this study could indicate where resources are most needed.",

After the stay-at-home orders, spread of the virus in these states plateaued since around late April-May and then stabilized to Sep. 2020 .(The New York Times, 2020 However, along with the record-breaking wave of pandemic since Oct. 2020 across all the transmission and fatality of COVID-19, in all 91 counties in three Eastern U.S. states (New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut) . First, using a two-stage analytic approach, we examined the association between population density and the spread of COVID-19 and fatality % at the county level. Second, we aimed to discern the urban environment indicators that can explain the effects of regional disparities (covering overcrowding, income inequality, medical service, race, and greenness) on the spread and fatality of COVID-19. In addition, we explored whether the association between urban environments on COVID-19 changed over the stages of the epidemic (the first wave, stabilized period, and the second wave stages).",

In Period 1, New York City showed the largest and fastest increase in the incidence, and the lowest and slowest increase was observed in Connecticut. Whereas, in Period 3, the reversed incidence pattern was observed; Connecticut showed the highest incidence and New York City showed the lowest incidence. Figure 2B shows the daily reproduction number (R t ) by study areas. The initial R t was highest in New York City (5.7) and lowest in Connecticut (3.3). After the beginning of the epidemic, Connecticut and New Jersey generally showed the highest R t . Figure 2C presents daily cases per 100,000 by sub-areas divided by high, mid, low population density areas. In Period 1, high density areas showed the highest incidence compared to mid and low density areas; however, in Period 3, mid density areas and low density areas showed higher incidence than high density area. Figure 2D presents R t by high, mid, low population density areas. Except for the early part of the pandemic, which showed the highest R t in high density areas, all areas showed similar R t during the study period. Figure 3A shows the spatial distribution of the number of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 persons during the total study period, and Figure 3B displays the relative increase in the incidence % associated with the population density. In the total period, the incidence % J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f was prominently highest in the areas with high density, and a rapid increase in the incidence was observed in areas with a population density over 403.4 (log population density=6). In addition, the peak of incidence was observed in counties where the population density was near 9-10 persons per 1km 2 (Richmond County [Staten Island], and Bronx and Queens boroughs in New York City). Figure 3C -D presents the spatial distribution (3C) of the initial R t (i.e. R 0 ) and the association between the initial R t and population density (3D). There was a nearly linear relationship of the initial R t with the population density. transmission was more prominent in Period 1 ( Figure S3D and Figure S4D ). Whereas, during Period 2 ( Figure S3E and Figure S4E ) and Period 3 ( Figure S3F and Figure S4F ), the relationship with population density was different from that of Period 1, and incidence % and average R t was generally higher in mid or low-density areas, compared to high-density areas. Table 2 shows the associations between the COVID-19 incidence % and urban environment indicators. In the total period, the % of the population that was Black or Hispanic and the % of the population under age 65 without health insurance showed the highest positive association with COVID-19 incidence %. The percent of households that are overcrowded household was also positively associated with incidence %. While, % elderly and EVI were negatively associated with COVID-19 incidence %. Table 2 also displays the relationship of the initial R t with the urban environment indicators. The initial R t showed the largest positive association with percent of the population that is Black and Hispanic and P80/P20, and it also positively associated with the percentage of households that are overcrowded, the population under age 65 without health J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof insurance, and the number of hospital beds per 1,000 persons. Whereas, the initial R t showed the strongest negative association with sex ratio, and EVI and elderly % were also significantly associated with the initial R t . Table S3 shows the sub-period results corresponding to Table 2. In the early epidemic period (Period 1), the associations with the urban environment indicator were generally similar to the results of Table 2 . Whereas, in Periods 2 or 3, and the association pattern was changed and varied, and some urban environment indicators (e.g., % of households that are overcrowded and EVI) showed an opposite directionality (positive) compared to the results of Period 1 (negative). Table 3 shows the association between COVID-19 mortality risk and urban environments indicators during the total study period. The percent of the population that is Black or Hispanic showed the largest positive association with COVID-19 mortality risk. Also, higher values of households that are overcrowded and the % of the population under age 65 without health insurance were substantially associated with higher mortality risk. Higher values of EVI, sex ratio and the number of hospital beds per 1,000 people were associated with lower mortality risk. Table S4 and Figure S5 show the sub-period results corresponding to Table 3 and Figure 4 , respectively, and the results were generally consistent during Period 1-2 (results of Period 3 in Table 3 could not be calculated due to the lack of sample size).",

The initial reproduction number (R 0 ) was also positively associated with population density at the county/borough level. Furthermore, the higher COVID-19 transmission was associated with higher % Black and Hispanic, % non-elderly without health insurance and overcrowding, and it was also associated with lower greenness, % elderly, and sex ratio indicating lower transmission with higher sex/ratio (men per 100 women). The mortality risk of COVID-19 was also generally higher in high density areas. In addition, urban environment indicators related to mortality risk were generally similar to the indicators associated with the COVID-19 transmission, and the number of hospital beds showed a negative association with the mortality risk.",

Further, minorities are more likely to be employed in industries providing essential services such as healthcare, food service, retail, and public transportation (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2018). Coupled with the shortage of personal protective equipment in the pandemic's early stages, underrepresented racial/ethnic populations likely had a higher chance of contracting COVID-19 due to increased contact with more people as a result of employment in essential services that did not allow telework or adequate sick leave (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020b).",

However, the recent Google Community Mobility Reports showed increases in park visitations in New Jersey and Connecticut during the pandemic (Aktay et al., 2020) , and it can imply that green space may bring people into contact with others.

We conjecture that relatively higher women economic activity in our study area ( (Institute for Women's Policy Research, 2018) might be related to our results; however we cannot fully explore these results with this data, and further research should investigate how sex/gender differences in COVID-19 outcomes vary regionally.",

Another hypothesis is that factors generally related to better general health conditions (e.g., better income and medical services) could affect the lower mortality risk of COVID-19. Moreover, earlier studies found that the number of hospital beds per person had a negative association with mortality risk. Hospital beds are vital to the treatment of patients with severe illness (Lee et al., 2020; Moghadas et al., 2020) , and the higher number of hospital beds can indicate the higher capacity for treatment of severe patients, such as beds in the intensive care unit, negative pressure beds, and ventilators (Lee et al., 2020) . Our results show that the limited accessibility to hospital beds may be a significant factor that can increase the mortality % and suggest the importance of securing sufficient hospital beds in urban areas where a greater spread of viral infection is expected.",

First, because of data limitations, we could not examine the spread pattern of more specific sub-populations, such as race/ethnicity, age, and sex, which might be associated differently with urban environments. Therefore, our study results should be interpreted as results for the total population. Second, although we considered multiple indicators and additional confounders, we could not fully adjust for potential confounding variables. In particular, when assessing the association between viral transmission and urban environment indicators, we could not consider possible variables that reflect indoor activities (e.g., types of work, working hours indoors, indoor athletic or leisure activities), public transportation, and social contact (e.g., number of people and duration of social gatherings), which can affect the viral contagion. In addition, a recent study conducted in U.S. 25 urban counties reported that the decreased mobility has a significant, positive association with reduced confirmed case growth (Badr et al., 2020) . Therefore, the relationships between different types of urban population mobility and COVID-19 outcomes can be examined more carefully in future studies. Third, our study used ecological urban environment variables, thus the results of this study can only suggest ecological associations between urban environments and COVID-19 outcomes, but cannot be interpreted as the associations or causalities at the individual level. Fourth, due to the insufficient sample size, this study could not consider a total of 31 counties in the R t -urban environment association analyses. Thus, the results could be biased towards counties with a large number of confirmed cases. Finally, we could not consider the possibility of underreporting deaths related to COVID-19. In particular, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that some deceased cases due to COVID-19 can be assigned to other death causes (not diagnosed or not mentioned on the death certificate) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021), which implies that the data on COVID-19 deaths used in this study might J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f be undercounted and our results related to mortality could be biased towards counties with fewer underreported deaths due to COVID-19. Further investigation examining the role of urban environments on COVID-19 or other infectious diseases should consider these limitations.",
