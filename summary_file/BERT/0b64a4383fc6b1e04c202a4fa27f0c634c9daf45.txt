In this review, we systematically summarized and analyzed all the herbal formulae provided by the guidelines according to their pattern identification and herbal compositions. We extended our search of guidelines to nearby countries and reviewed guidelines issued by mainland China (25 provincial guidelines and 1 national guideline) and South Korea to conduct a more comprehensive review. The active components contained in these 2 herbs also showed antiinflammatory benefits in the in vivo studies of the acute lung injury model. Pinelliae Praeparatum cum Zingiberis and Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium were only identified in the list of frequently used herbs in the recovery stage where patients may suffer from white and thin phlegm after their recovery. This herb is prescribed for dry cough caused by yin deficiency and is especially suitable for patients in the recovered stage. 25 The herbal formula Qingfei Paidu Tang was recommended by both Chinese and Korean guidelines. In the Chinese guidelines, this formula is recommended for all stages. The results provided by this review are a summary of the traditional medicine guidelines, which can only be considered as guidance, and clinical verification is still required.
