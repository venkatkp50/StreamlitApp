Introduction Transitions during COVID-19

In response to COVID-19, elective outpatient appointments at the Center were suspended on March 23 rd , 2020. Patients with urgent care issues such as pain pump refills or acute neurologic or medical complaints continued to be seen onsite. Within two weeks, PCS follow-up appointments were selectively rescheduled as virtual appointments and, as comfort with telehealth visits grew, virtual initial evaluations were scheduled. In mid-May, selected nonurgent onsite visits, including some interventionalist pain procedures, resumed with COVID safety measures in place. Patients could elect onsite or virtual pain evaluations and follow-up appointments with provider discretion.The FRP closed temporarily and re-opened in early May with a hybrid structure of telehealth and onsite activities; patients could attend all in-person, all virtually, or in combination.Medical and psychological pain care transitioned relatively seamlessly. Virtual PT was facilitated through McKenzie Mechanical Diagnosis and Treatment (MDT) approaches in which therapists assess patients by observing active movements of the spine or extremities to determine classifications and recommend appropriate interventions. MDT has been demonstrated to be both efficacious (1) and cost-effective (2) and because manual therapy is not usually necessary, it has proven adaptable to virtual care. Individualized remote training evolved using resistance bands, milk crates containing items of known weight, and available exercise equipmentHome-based pain appointments and FRP sessions allowed patients to set up their home activity spaces for success, to practice new behaviors under supervision in their natural environment Academy of Pain Medicine   Pain Medicine   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60 with its usual cues and challenges, and to gradually transition to independent pain self-care, aligning well with behavior change theories that emphasize the importance of learning context in sustaining change. (3) Providers could observe patients' home contexts to better inform care and patients' social support systems could engage more easily, observing a patient's abilities and learning helpful responses to pain. Telehealth also reduced barriers to care, such as travel and childcare needs, resulting in fewer cancellations, late arrivals and missed appointments.Given these experiences, options for telehealth pain care are expected to continue beyond the pandemic. However, improvement in access to broadband and technology devices is needed for equitable engagement.Patient acceptance of telehealth has not been formally assessed across the CP&S. However, in the 8 months from July 2020 through February 2021, 49% of 602 pain follow-ups and 20% of 474 new evaluations were conducted by telehealth despite availability of in-person visits. In addition, a DHMC palliative care survey of 199 patients with 70 respondents found 60% would prefer telehealth visits even in the absence of COVID-19 risk. (4) These findings resonate with recent studies in pain-related fields indicating telehealth satisfaction reported by 88% (5) and 98% (6) of patients, with 45% and 64.5% respectively preferring telehealth.

ECHO background

The Project ECHO model, developed at the University of New Mexico, aims to bring specialty level services to under-resourced areas through tele-mentoring of community clinicians. ECHOs usually include a series of virtual sessions, each with a brief didactic followed by a case presentation and interactive case discussion supporting reciprocal learning among attendees and expert panelists. The model has proven effective in increasing knowledge, competence, and skills and in reducing professional isolation. As of 2020 there were 160 ECHO programs on pain, palliative care and/or opioids in the U.S. and other countries.

ECHO Outcomes

Participants ECHO registrants were surveyed before and one week after the course, then answered a shorter query on practice change 14 weeks later. Twenty four, 19 and 10 of the 57 participants responded respectively. Participants rated their confidence in using various chronic pain approaches immediately pre and post course, indicating "not confident", "somewhat confident", "confident", or "highly confident". Endorsement of "confident" or "highly confident" across all skills increased from an average of 44% pre-course to 76% post-course. Figure 1 below shows the percent who reported "confident" or "highly confident" for each skill pre-and post-ECHO.

Figure 1. Participant Confidence in Pain Management Skills

One hundred percent of respondents "agreed" or "strongly agreed" one week post-course that they experienced a decreased sense of professional isolation through participation. Asked to compare ECHO to other education, comments included: "The longitudinal track over 10 weeks was superiorâ€¦allowed time to reflect and apply lessons between sessions"; "better, due to more engagement, more active participation and face to face nature makes it more intimate, 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60 less formal and less passive" and "incredibly useful and excellent layout for participation and delivery of information". Eight of the 10 participants responding to the 14 week query on practice change indicated they had implemented changes as a result of the course, most frequently citing increased "multidisciplinary", "integrated" or "team-based care", as well as new use of specific therapies. Given the low response rate to the surveys, however, these findings may not reflect the value for participants overall. 

Figure 2. Panelist Experience of Participation in Chronic Pain ECHO Series

Panelist responses indicated that, in addition to providing valuable pain education for community clinicians, participation highlighted opportunities for our health system to improve the pain services it offers our communities. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60 One panelist reported greater awareness of "gaps in resources" and greater appreciation of "the challenge faced by rural providers with limited resources available to their patients".Another noted the value of hearing "the different perspectives of providers here as well as the difference of those who work in the general community practices". The ECHO generated specific ideas to improve pain clinical services and education. One panelist stated "I hope we can develop a scalable behavioral and support program for our primary care patients with chronic pain, borrowing from the functional restoration program and existing chronic pain self-management group." Another commented on "working with colleagues on the development of smart phrases [EHR guidance for clinicians] and inclusion of more activity-based management ". A third noted that the ECHO helped facilitate the "building of an 'active pain care' service" to engage patients in active self-care that had been 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60 of the psychological care of the patient", "helped me refocus on motivational interviewing and the importance in pain care and education" and "helped me revisit the importance of my wording in messaging to my patients about their underlying diagnosis and the impact that can have on their fears and activity avoidance."

COVID-19 and Project ECHO driving innovations

Covid-19 demanded an immediate leap to use of telehealth in pain care, including medical management, clinical counseling and physical therapy, changes that our clinicians agree would have been unlikely in the absence of compelling need. Paralleling the transition to telehealth, the ECHO experience brought together diverse professionals engaged in pain treatment from across the system and demonstrated the value of interactive virtual group education for clinicians. In doing so, ECHO illuminated the feasibility and potential value of using virtual platforms to provide group pain education and therapy for patients as well.Together the transition to telehealth and experience of Project ECHO catalyzed rapid implementation of diverse pain services in our system, including both clinical care and pain education. Prior to COVID-19 and the Pain ECHO, most pain care services were available exclusively in person. Now, FRP and most other pain services, including medical management, psycho-behavioral care and physical therapy, can be accessed either onsite or virtually.(Procedural interventions are an exception). 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60 Previously, psycho-behavioral care and pain education were available only by in-person participation in the FRP in group format, through a single one-hour pain education group, or as individual services for which there was a 4-6 month waitlist. One year after the onset of COVID-19 and 3 months after the final Pain ECHO session, the CP&S offers a diverse array of virtual and onsite pain education and psycho-behavioral care opportunities to meet each patient's readiness for change. Among these: Welcome Group (introduction to active pain management); Mindfulness for Chronic Pain; and Healing Trauma and Pain (a women's group), as well as specific groups for patients with headache, musculoskeletal, and neuropathic pain, among others. In addition, DH is now offering continuing virtual pain education opportunities for providers using Project ECHO, including a current ECHO "Multidisciplinary Approach to Pediatric Pain " and an upcoming palliative care ECHO.In our rural area where geography and socio-economic challenges have been barriers to consistent pain care, embrace of virtual platforms has radically increased opportunities for patients to access pain care and pain education, as well as increasing opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration, communication, and education among pain providers.The focus, structure, and audiences for these opportunities are expected to continue to change as the pandemic recedes. Which new opportunities will thrive going forward remains uncertain, but it is clear that rapid adaptation of our systems to meet clinical needs during COVID-19, combined with our ECHO experience, has driven innovations that will endure and better serve our rural communities.

Summary of Lesson Learned

ï‚· Interactive virtual education models, such as Project ECHO, can nurture collegial relationships among ECHO education providers, as well as participants, in a manner that enhances interdisciplinary collaboration and care both within and external to the system. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60 ï‚· Interdisciplinary meetings, case conferences and education sessions may be facilitated more efficiently through virtual means than by bringing people together at one geographic location, relevant both within healthcare systems and among geographically distributed rural providers .  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58 Pre-ECHO Post-ECHO % Respondents indicating "confident" or "highly confident" in using different chronic pain management strategies with their patients Figure 2 .
