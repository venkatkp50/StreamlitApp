Synopsis 26

Background 27 The major global health threat tuberculosis is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Mtb has a complex 28 cell envelope -a partially covalently linked composite of polysaccharides, peptidoglycan and lipids, including a 29 mycolic acid layer -which conveys pathogenicity but also protects against antibiotics. Given previous successes 30 in treating gram-positive and -negative infections with cell wall degrading enzymes, we investigated such 31 approach for Mtb. 32 Objectives 33 (i) Development of an Mtb microtiter growth inhibition assay that allows undisturbed cell envelope formation, to 34 overcome the invalidation of results by typical clumped Mtb-growth in surfactant-free assays. (ii) Exploring anti- 35 Mtb potency of cell wall layer-degrading enzymes. (iii) Investigation of the concerted action of several such 36 enzymes. 37 Methods 38 We inserted a bacterial luciferase-operon in an auxotrophic Mtb strain to develop a microtiter assay that allows 39 proper evaluation of cell wall degrading anti-Mtb enzymes. We assessed growth-inhibition by enzymes 40 (recombinant mycobacteriophage mycolic acid esterase (LysB), fungal α-amylase and human and chicken egg 41 white lysozymes) and combinations thereof, in presence or absence of biopharmaceutically acceptable surfactant. 42

Our biosafety level-2 assay identified both LysB and lysozymes as potent Mtb-inhibitors, but only in presence of 44 surfactant. Moreover, most potent disruption of the mycolic acid hydrophobic barrier was obtained by the highly 45 synergistic combination of LysB, α-amylase and polysorbate 80. Bacteriophage PG-degrading enzymes (endolysins) are increasingly investigated as antibacterial agents, with 65 several products for topical use against Gram-positive infections already on the market, 12,13 and progress being 66 made for Gram-negative pathogens. 14-16 Such products are rapidly gaining attention due to the looming antibiotics 67 resistance crisis, together with improved know-how in biopharmaceutical protein production and formulation for 68 nebulization or dry powder inhalation. In the context of respiratory diseases such as TB, it is encouraging that several recombinant biopharmaceutical protein treatments (e.g. dornase alpha to reduce viscosity of airway 70 mucus) have been successfully developed for inhalation. 17 However, due to their distinctive cell wall, 71 bacteriophage-mediated lysis of mycobacteria is more complicated than that of other Gram-positives. In addition 72 to endolysin, mycobacteriophages employ a mycomembrane-targeting mycolylarabinogalactan esterase (LysB) to 73 lyse mycobacteria. 18 Obviously this could affect the validity of results obtained with cell wall degrading enzymes, and precludes 92 exploration of surface-active components in the enzyme cocktail. In this study, we solve both problems by developing a bioluminescent derivative of a biosafety level 2 triple auxotrophic Mtb. 33 The bacterial lux operon 94 used does not require cellular uptake of any cofactor, 34 which allows for quantifying metabolic activity in static, 95 clumped cultures. 96 We set out to systematically assess the potency of enzymes that degrade the various layers of the Mtb cell wall, 97 using cultivation conditions that keep the Mtb cell wall/biofilm intact. Apart from PG and the mycomembrane, we 98 targeted the outer capsule of Mtb. Considering that α-glucan is a main constituent of this capsule, 10 we speculated 99 that Aspergillus oryzae α-amylase, an α-glucan hydrolyzing enzyme already used in human medicine to treat 100 pancreatic insufficiency, could have a capsule-destabilizing effect and potentially synergise with the known 101 capsule destabilization imparted by polysorbate 80. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the anti-TB potency of 102 cell wall-degrading enzyme treatments would be enhanced by using the enzymes in cocktails, which could 103 potentially 'peel' the cell envelope layer-by-layer and synergistically weaken it (Figure 1 ). Amylase-induced 104 hydrolysis of the capsular layer may, for instance, increase permeability for enzymes such as LysB that degrade 105 the mycomembrane and/or for enzymes such as lysozyme that degrade the PG layer underneath. 106

Materials 108 Chicken egg white lysozyme was purchased at Sigma-Aldrich (L6876, ≥90% protein), as was human lysozyme 109 recombinant from rice (L1667, ≥90% pure) and Aspergillus oryzae α-amylase (A8220, ≥800 fungal amylase units/g). The release of p-nitrophenol after hydrolysis of the pNPB substrate was measured as increase in absorbance at 400 nm for 30 minutes, and the ∆A400nm/minute was calculated from the linear region of the blank-corrected values 138 after a lag-phase. The specific enzyme activity was calculated using the micromolar extinction coefficient of 139 p-nitrophenol at 400 nm at 37°C of 0.0148. One LysB enzyme unit releases 1 nmol of p-nitrophenol per minute at 140 pH 8 at 37 °C using pNPB as substrate. capacitance, 800 Ω resistance). After selection on kanamycin, the obtained Mtb mc 2 7902_Lux strain was stored in 158 1 ml aliquots at OD600 1 in 20% glycerol at -80 °C. For each drug testing assay, two Mtb mc 2 7902_Lux aliquots were 159 thawed, combined and cultured at 37 °C, shaking, in a 60 ml square bottle in 20 ml of Middlebrook 7H9 broth (BD Diagnostics) supplemented with 0.05%V/V polysorbate 80, 10% oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase supplement 161 (OADC; BD Diagnostics), 0.5%V/V glycerol, 1 mM L-arginine, 50 µg/ml L-leucine and 24 µg/ml L-pantothenate. At 162 days 5 and 8 after thawing, bacteria were subcultured by 1/100 and 1/20 dilution, respectively, for use in setting 163 up the antimicrobial assays on day 9. Middlebrook 7H10 agar (BD Diagnostics) supplemented with 10% OADC, 164 0.5%V/V glycerol, 1 mM L-arginine, 50 µg/ml L-leucine and 24 µg/ml L-pantothenate was used for growth of Mtb 165 on solid culture; colony counts after incubation at 37 °C for up to 12 weeks were given as colony forming units per 166 ml plated (cfu/ml). 167 A bioluminescence microtiter assay for mycobacterial growth inhibition 168 To remove bacterial clumps before setting up the microtiter assay, mycobacteria were passed three times through 169 a 27G needle. A Mtb mc 2 7902_Lux inoculum at an OD600 of 0.008 (2•10 6 cfu/ml) was prepared in assay medium 170 (Middlebrook 7H9 broth supplemented with 10% OADC, 0.5%V/V glycerol, 1 mM L-arginine, 50 µg/ml L-leucine and 171 24 µg/ml L-pantothenate) without any polysorbate 80 unless specifically stated otherwise. (Figure 2a-b) . Minor low molecular weight bands were observed in purified Lys-Ms6, probably indicating low level 202 protein degradation. Enzymatic activity on a pNPB substrate seemed highly dependent on the bacteriophage from 203 which the enzyme was derived, with LysB-D29 displaying three-fold higher specific activity than LysB-Ms6 (Table   204 1, not significant, p=0.2, Mann-Whitney test). Enzymatic activity of commercially available lysozyme was validated 205 using a Micrococcus PG degradation assay (Table 1,
