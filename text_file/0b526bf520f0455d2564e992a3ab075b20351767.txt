However, there is a lack of insights on factors that might prevent athletes from joining or staying in the "bubble".For instance, many of the current recommendations are predominantly focusing on the quarantine differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated athletes, as opposed to a connected evaluation of how athletes' positive COVID-19 tests might influence their "bubble" statuswhether athletes could participate in the Games and advance their career as planned. In light of the high prevalence of breakthrough cases amid Omicron spread (COVID-19 infections in vaccinated people), 2 it is important to give equal weight to all safety measures that could protect athletes' safety during the Games. Furthermore, the intensity, and possible negativity, 4 of media reports on the Games, may further add stressors that could strain athletes' mental health. 5 However, there is a dearth of research on how athletes should cope with the range of mental health concerns and challenges they face during the Games. The authors wish to express their gratitude to the editor and reviewers for their kind and constructive insights that helped improve this paper.
