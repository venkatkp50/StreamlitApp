Introduction

This paper is an update of our previous papers [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Here, we present recent progress in determination of | | with updated inputs from lattice QCD.Here, we follow the color convention of our previous papers [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] in Tables 1-7 . We use the red color for the new input data which is used to evaluate . We use the blue color for the new input data which is not used for some obvious reason. 0 The absorptive part of long distance effects on is parametrized into 0 .

Input parameter

There are two independent methods to determine 0 in lattice QCD: the indirect and direct methods. The indirect method is to determine 0 using Eq. (1) with lattice QCD results for 2 combined with experimental results for / , , and . The direct method is to determine 0 directly using the lattice QCD results for Im 0 , combined with experimental results for Re 0 .In Table 1 (a), we summarize experimental results for Re 0 and Re 2 . In Table 1 (b), we summarize lattice results for Im 0 and Im 2 calculated by RBC-UKQCD. In Table 1 (c), we summarize results for 0 which is obtained using results in Table 1 (a) and (b).Here, we use results of the indirect method for 0 to evaluate , since its systematic and statistical errors are much smaller than those of the direct method.

Input parameters: | |

In Table 2 (a) and (b), we present recent updates for exclusive | | and inclusive | | respectively. In Table 2 (a), we summarize results for exclusive | | obtained by various groups: HFLAV, BELLE, BABAR, FNAL/MILC, LHCb, and FLAG. Results from LHCb comes from analysis on → * ℓ¯decays which are not available in the -factories. Since the decays modes of have poor statistics, the final results have overall uncertainty much larger than those of by an order of magnitude. Hence, we drop out results of LHCb in this article without loss of fairness. The rest of results for exclusive | | have comparable size of errors and are consistent with one another within 1.0 statistical uncertainty. In addition, it is nice to observe all the results be consistent between the CLN and BGL analysis, after all the boisterous debates [2, 11] .In Table 2 (b), we present recent results for inclusive | |. The HFLAV group has reported the same results for inclusive | | in 2021 as in 2017, while FLAG reported updated results.

Input parameters: Wolfenstein parameters

In Table 3 (a), we present the Wolfenstein parameters on the market. As explained in Ref. [2, 6] , we use the results of angle-only-fit (AOF) in Table 3 (a) in order to avoid unwanted correlation between ( , | |), and (¯,¯). We determine from | | which is obtained from the ℓ2 and ℓ3 decays using lattice QCD inputs for form factors and decay constants. We determine the parameter from | |. 

Input parameters:ˆ, LD , and others

In FLAG 2021 [17] , they report lattice QCD results forˆwith = 2, = 2 + 1, and = 2 + 1 + 1. Here, we use the results forˆwith = 2 + 1, which is obtained by taking an average over the four data points from BMW 11, Laiho 11, RBC-UKQCD 14, and SWME 15 in Table 4 (a).The dispersive long distance (LD) effect is defined asAs explained in Refs. [2] , there are two independent methods to estimate LD : one is the BGI estimate [27] , and the other is the RBC-UKQCD estimate [28, 29] . The BGI method is to estimate the size of LD using chiral perturbation theory as follows,The RBC-UKQCD method is to estimate the size of LD as follows, Here, we use both methods to estimate the size of LD . In Table 3 (b), we present higher order QCD corrections: with , = , . A new approach using − unitarity instead of − unitarity appeared in Ref. [30] , which is supposed to have a better convergence with respect to the charm quark mass. But we have not incorporated this into our analysis yet, which we will do in near future.In Table 4 (b), we present other input parameters needed to evaluate .

Quark mass

In Table 5 , we present the charm quark mass ( ) and top quark mass ( ). From FLAG 2021 [17] , we take the results for ( ) with = 2 + 1, since there is some inconsistency among In Table 6 Fig. (a) , we present the time evolution of top pole mass . Here we find that the average value drifts downward a little bit and the error shrinks fast as time goes on, since LHC has been accumulating high statistics on . The data for 2020 is dropped out intentionally to reflect on the absence of Lattice 2020 due to COVID-19, even though it is available. 

Results for

In Fig. 1 , we show results for | | evaluated directly from the standard model (SM) with lattice QCD inputs given in the previous sections. In Fig. 1 (a) , the blue curve represents the theoretical evaluation of | | obtained using the FLAG-2021 results forˆ, AOF for Wolfenstein parameters, the [FNAL/MILC 2021, BGL] results for exclusive | |, results for 0 with the indirect method, and the RBC-UKQCD estimate for LD . The red curve in Fig. 1 represents the experimental results for | |. In Fig. 1 (b) , the blue curve represents the same as in Fig. 1 (a) except for using the 1S scheme results for the inclusive | |. Our results for | | SM and Δ are summarized in Table 7 . Here, the superscript SM represents the theoretical expectation value of | | obtained directly from the SM. The superscript Exp represents the experimental value of | | = 2.228(11) × 10 −3 . Results in Table 7 (a) are obtained using the RBC-UKQCD estimate for LD , and those in Table 7 (b) are obtained using the BGI estimate for LD . In Table 7 (a), we find that the theoretical expectation values of | | SM with lattice QCD inputs (with exclusive | |) has 4.54 ∼ 3.68 tension with the experimental value of | | Exp , while there is no tension with inclusive | | (obtained using heavy quark expansion and QCD sum rules).In Fig. 2 (a) , we show the time evolution of Δ starting from 2012 to 2022. In 2012, Δ was 2.5 , but now it is 4.5 with exclusive | | (FNAL/MILC 2021, BGL). In Fig. 2 (b) , we show the time evolution of the average Δ and the error Δ during the period of 2012-2022.At present, we find that the largest error (≈ 45%) in | | SM comes from | |. Hence, it is essential to reduce the error in | | significantly. To achieve this goal, there is an on-going project to extract exclusive | | using the Oktay-Kronfeld (OK) action for the heavy quarks to calculate the form factors for¯→ ( * ) ℓ¯decays [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] .A large portion of interesting results for | | SM and Δ could not be presented in Table 7 and in Fig. 2 due to lack of space: for example, results for | | SM obtained using exclusive | | (FLAG 2021), results for | | SM obtained using 0 determined by the direct method, and so on. We plan to report them collectively in Ref. [38] .
