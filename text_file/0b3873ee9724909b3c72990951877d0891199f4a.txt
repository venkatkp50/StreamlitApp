Dear Editor,

We have read with great interest the correspondence of Kahraman et al. (2020) on the emergence of oral mucosal changes adjacent to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection; hereby we demonstrate the characteristics of thirteen laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients with oral mucositis according to the CARE guidelines. 1, 2 The referenced patients sought care at our department from April to August 2020 due to generalized pain and soreness within the oral cavity related mainly to non-keratinized mucosa without a specific cause ( Table   1 ). All included patients had previously undergone polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2, which confirmed their infection with a mean cycle threshold (Ct) value of 18.46 ± 3.8 (12-26).Their mean age was 51.08 ± 8.79 (34-62) years old, and eight of them (62.5%) were females. Regarding their COVID-19 symptoms, two patients (15.4%) had persistent fever, four (30.8%) had ageusia, and two (15.4%) had anosmia. The majority of them (69.2%) had a mild course of SARS-CoV-2 infection and were prescribed paracetamol (PCM); contrarily, four patients experienced a moderate course of infection -two patients (15.4%) were prescribed chloroquine and other two (15.4%) were prescribed dexamethasone. 3 The mean onset of mucositis emergence was 0.85 ± 0.8 (0-2) days calculated since the day of PCR testing, while its mean duration was 8.62 ± 3.07 (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) days. An 11-item numerical rating scale (NRS) was used to evaluate the manifested intraoral pain where "0" denotes "no pain" and "10" denotes "pain as bad as you can imagine". 4 The mean score of pain intensity was 5.08 ± 2.36 (3-9). On intraoral examination, sporadic erythema with minor irritations was found all over the mouth (53.8%), on the buccal mucosa (30.8%), palate (15.4%), and gingiva (7.7%). Depapillation of the tongue was observed in all cases with a tendency to be more localized at the borders (Figure 1 ). This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

Oral Mucositis of COVID-19 Patients

While nine patients (69.2%) were prescribed 'Magic mouthwash' containing lidocaine 1%, chlorhexidine 2%, and prednisolone 20 mg in 100 ml, four patients (30.8%) were prescribed PCM to relieve their symptoms of mucositis. Mann-Whitney test yielded a statistically significant difference favouring 'Magic mouthwash' in reducing the duration of mucositis, U (N Magic = 9, N PCM = 4) = 4.5, z = -2.85, p = 0.034.Inferential statistics revealed that COVID-19 severity was significantly associated with duration of mucositis and its pain (H = 5.76 and 9.29; P = 0.016 and 0.002 respectively). Ageusia was also significantly associated with Ct value, mucositis duration, and onset (U = 2, 4.5, and 1.5; P = 0.013, 0.034, and 0.018 respectively).Our findings support the suggested role of oral mucosa in providing an entry for SARS-CoV-2 due to the high expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptors. 5 According to Sonis theory, oral mucositis is primarily initiated by oxidative stress and the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to somatotoxic doses of non-surgical oncologic treatment. 6 The excessive production of ROS in the mucosal tissues of severely ill COVID-19 patients may explain the significant direct association observed in our cases between severity of COVID-19 and mucositis duration and pain intensity. 7 Secondary infections and drug reactions cannot be ruled out entirely, especially with severely ill patients due to immune dysregulation. 8 In addition, oral mucosal changes were consistently observed in children with paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with SARS-COV-2 (PIM S -TS), which is suggested to be linked to IgG antibody-mediated enhancement. 9 In conclusion, oral mucositis may occur in COVID-19 patients either as a direct manifestation of cellular damage triggered by SARS-CoV-2 or as an opportunistic infection due to immune dysregulation.
