There are no studies in patients with VF/pulseless VT directly comparing the effects of various positions of paddle/pad placement on defibrillation success and ROSC. Most studies evaluate cardioversion (eg, AF) or secondary end points (eg, TTI) . No data on pads size related to survival outcome are available.

Unchanged from 2010

Three questions: (1) aerosol generation associated with key interventions;(2) risk of airborne infection transmission associated with key interventions; and (3) the effect of different personal protective equipment strategies.Eleven studies included: two cohort studies, one case control study, five case reports, and three manikin randomised controlled trials.We did not find any direct evidence that chest compressions or defibrillation either are or are not associated with aerosol generation or transmission of infection. Data from manikin studies indicates that donning of personal protective equipment delays treatment delivery. Studies provided only indirect evidence, with no study describing patients with COVID-19. Evidence certainty was low or very low for all outcomes.It is uncertain whether chest compressions or defibrillation cause aerosol generation or transmission of COVID-19 to rescuers. There is very limited evidence and a rapid need for further studies. Barcala-Furelos 2020 Simulation / manikin pilot study was carried out to determine the feasibility of the preassembled kit of facemask and HEPA filter adapted on a pre-set plastic-blanket Ten rescuers took part in the pilot study.

RCT

Intervention: Use of plastic blanket with HEPA filterThe average time to wear PPE and place the preassembly kit on the victim was 82 s . After 10 min the quality of the resuscitation (QCPR) was 91% [87] [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] [94] . Quality chest compressions (CC) were 22% better than ventilations (V). Most of the rescuers (60%) thought that placing the plastic blanket on the victim on the beach was somewhat simple or very simple.Author conclusion: Plastic blanket plus basic ventilations equipment resource could be a new alternative to be considered for lifeguards to keep ventilation on use while reducing risk transmission Adelborg 2014Adelborg 2011 A randomised crossover comparison of mouth-toface-shield ventilation and mouth-to-pocketmask ventilation by surf lifeguards in a manikin A randomised crossover comparison of mouth-topocket and bag-mask ventilation to mouth-tomouth ventilation by surf lifeguards in a manikin Surf lifeguards

Surf lifeguards

Intervention: Mouth-to-faceshield Control: Mouth-to-pocketmask Intervention: 1. Mouth-topocket-mask ventilation 2. Bag-maskventilation Control: Mouth-to-mouth Thirty surf lifeguards (mean (SD) age: 25.1 (4.8) years; 21 male, 9 female) were randomly assigned to perform 2 x 3 min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation on a manikin using mouth-to-face-shield ventilation (AMBU LifeKey) and mouth-to-pocket-mask ventilation (Laerdal Pocket Mask) . Interruptions in chest compressions per cycle were increased with mouth-to-face-shield ventilation (mean (SD) 8.6 (1.7) s) compared with mouth-to-pocket-mask ventilation (6.9 (1.2) s, p < 0.0001). The proportion of effective ventilations was less using mouth-to-face-shield ventilation (199/242 (82%) ) compared with mouth-topocket-mask ventilation (239/240 (100%), p = 0.0002). Tidal volume was lower using mouth-to-face-shield ventilation (mean (SD) 0.36 (0.20) l) compared with mouth-to-pocket-mask ventilation (0. 45 (0.20) l, p = 0.006). No differences in inspiratory times were observed between mouth-to-face-shield ventilation and mouth-to-pocket-mask ventilation A total of 60 surf lifeguards were included (67% male, 33% female, mean age 25 years). Interruptions in chest compressions were significantly reduced by MMV (8.9 +/-1.6 s) when compared to MPV (10.7 +/-3.0 s, P < 0.001) and BMV (12.5 +/-3.5s, P < 0.001). Significantly more effective ventilations (visible chest rise) were delivered using MMV (91%) when compared to MPV (79%, P < 0.001) and BMV (59%, P < 0.001). The inspiratory time was longer during MMV (0.7 +/-0.2 s) and MPV (0.7 +/-0.2s, P < 0.001 for both) compared to BMV (0.5 +/-0.2s). Tidal volumes were significantly lower using BMV (0.4 +/-0.2L) compared to MMV (0.6 +/-0.2L, P < 0.001) and MPV (0.6 +/-0.3 L, P < 0.001), whereas no differences were observed when comparing MMV and MPV.Author conclusion: Mouth-to-faceshield ventilation increases interruptions in chest compressions, reduces the proportion of effective ventilations and decreases delivered tidal volumes compared with mouth-to-pocketmask ventilation.Author conclusion: MMV reduces interruptions in chest compressions and produces a higher proportion of effective ventilations during lifeguard CPR.

Last ILCOR Consensus on Science and Treatment Recommendation:

For the critical outcome of «survival with favorable neurologic outcome at discharge», we identified low-certainty evidence (downgraded for serious risk of bias and indirectness) from 1 RCT enrolling 415 OHCAs showing no benefit for interrupting chest compressions to check rhythm immediately after shock delivery (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.70-1.15) (Beesems 2016, 1) and a very-low-certainty evidence (downgraded for serious risk of bias, indirectness, and imprecision) from 3 observational studies enrolling 763 OHCAs showing a harmful effect for interrupting chest compressions to check rhythm immediately after shock delivery (RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.51-0.75) (Kellum 2006, 335; Rea 2006 Rea , 2760 Bobrow 2008 Bobrow , 1158 (Rea 2006 (Rea , 2760 Bobrow 2008 Bobrow , 1158 Embase: ("Out of

that lay persons initiate CPR for presumed cardiac arrest without concerns of harm to patients not in cardiac arrest (strong recommendation, very low certainty evidence). 16% of the cases were found to be mild, 48% were moderate, and 35% of the cases were severe.There were no studies reporting the critical outcomes of favorable neurological outcome, survival, or the important outcome of ROSC. For the important outcome of physiological end points, we identified 3 verylow certainty studies (downgraded for bias, indirectness, and imprecision). One crossover study in 17 adults with prolonged resuscitation from nontraumatic cardiac arrest observed improved peak arterial pressure during compression systole (114±51 mm Hg compared with 95±42 mm Hg) and ETCO2 (11.0±6.7 mm Hg compared with 9.6±6.9 mm Hg) when compressions were performed over the lower third of the sternum compared with the center of the chest, but arterial pressure during compression recoil, peak right atrial pressure, and coronary perfusion pressure did not differ. A second crossover study in 30 adults with cardiac arrest observed no difference in ETCO2 values resulting from changes in hand placement. A third crossover study in 10 children observed higher peak systolic pressure and higher mean arterial pressure when compressions were performed on the lower third of the sternum compared with the middle of the sternum.This treatment recommendation (below) is unchanged from 2015. We suggest performing chest compressions on the lower half of the sternum on adults in cardiac arrest (weak recommendation, very-low-certainty evidence). Population: Adults and children with presumed cardiac arrest in out-of-hospital settings.Treatment recommendation:We suggest the use of real-time audiovisual feedback and prompt devices during CPR in clinical practice as part of a comprehensive quality improvement program for cardiac arrest designed to ensure high-quality CPR delivery and resuscitation care across an EMS system (weak recommendation, very-low-certainty evidence).We suggest against the use of real-time audiovisual feedback and prompt devices in isolation (ie, not part of a comprehensive quality improvement program) (weak recommendation, very-low-certainty evidence). We suggest a short period of CPR until the defibrillator is ready for analysis and/or defibrillation in unmonitored cardiac arrest. (weak recommendation, low-certainty evidence). Outcomes: Survival to hospital discharge with good neurological outcome and survival to hospital discharge were ranked as critical outcomes. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and physiological measures (e.g., blood pressure and end-tidal PCO2) were ranked as a important outcomes.We suggest that back slaps are used initially in adults and children with an FBAO and an ineffective cough (weak recommendation, very-low certainty evidence).We suggest that abdominal thrusts are used in adults and children (older than 1 year) with an FBAO and an ineffective cough when back slaps are ineffective (weak recommendation, very-low-certainty evidence).We suggest that rescuers consider the manual extraction of visible items in the mouth (weak recommendation, very-low-certainty evidence).We suggest against the use of blind finger sweeps in patients with an FBAO (weak recommendation, very-low-certainty evidence). We suggest that appropriately skilled healthcare providers use Magill forceps to remove an FBAO in patients with OHCA from FBAO (weak recommendation, very-low-certainty evidence).We suggest that chest thrusts be used in unconscious adults and children with an FBAO (weak recommendation, very-low-certainty evidence). We suggest that bystanders undertake interventions to support FBAO removal as soon as possible after recognition (weak recommendation, very-low-certainty evidence).We suggest against the routine use of suction-based airway clearance devices (weak recommendation, very-low-certainty evidence). Gutierrez 2020 Case report Case report of gastric perforation after abdominal thrust Pawlukiewicz 2020 Case report Cholesterol embolization syndrome resulting in ischaemic leg of person providing abdominal thrusts.We suggest against the routine use of artifact-filtering algorithms for analysis of electrocardiographic rhythm during CPR (weak recommendation, very-low-certainty evidence). We recommend that dispatch centers implement a standardized algorithm and/or standardized criteria to immediately determine if a patient is in cardiac arrest at the time of emergency call (strong recommendation, very-low-certainty evidence). We suggest that dispatch centers monitor and track diagnostic capability. We suggest that dispatch centers look for ways to optimize sensitivity (minimize false negatives). We recommend high-quality research that examines gaps in this area. Identification of trigger words in emergency calls in order to improve the specificity of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest recognition (association between trigger word and correct identification of cardiac arrest).No trigger word was associated with confirmed cardiac arrest. 'Is wheezing' was a frequently used spontaneous trigger word among later confirmed cardiac arrest victims. Schwarzkoph, 2020 5 Retrospective cohort.

The seizure-like activity group had a longer median time to dispatcher Reported seizure-like activity among patients in cardiac arrest poses a barrier to recognition of cardiac arrests by dispatchers leading to delays in resuscitation instructions.We recommend that submersion duration be used as a prognostic indicator when making decisions surrounding search and rescue resource management/operations (strong recommendation, moderate-certainty evidence for prognostic significance).We suggest against the use of age, EMS response time, water type (fresh or salt), water temperature, and witness status when making prognostic decisions (weak recommendation, very-low-certainty evidence for prognostic significance).We acknowledge that this review excluded exceptional and rare case reports that identify good outcomes after prolonged submersion in icy cold water.

Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria:

The public access AED is defined as defibrillation with onsite AED attempted by bystander layperson in the OHCA setting. Both patients with no AED use (CPR only group) and those who received defibrillation by first responders (ex, policeman) or paramedics were all included to control group because we considered them as one of several forms of traditional EMS response. This meta-analysis also includes "before vs after comparison study" or "early vs late comparison study" which compare before or early period of PAD implementation with after or late period in the community. The studies with overlapping population were excluded in the analysis. Studies with wrong population, wrong intervention, wrong outcome, wrong design, and lack of information were excluded. Background: More than 80% of public-access defibrillation attempts do not result in sustained return of spontaneous circulation in patients who have had an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and a shockable heart rhythm before arrival of emergency medical service (EMS) personnel. Neurological and survival outcomes in such patients have not been evaluated. We aimed to assess the neurological status and survival outcomes in such patients.We included RCTs, non-randomised studies, case series with at least five cases. We considered papers in all languages provided there was an English language abstract available for review.We excluded unpublished studies, conference abstracts, manikin or simulation studies, narrative reviews, editorials or opinions with no primary data, animal studies and experimental / lab models

Methods: This is a retropective analysis of a cohort study from a prospective, nationwide, population-based registry of 1 299 784 patients who had an OHCA event between Jan 1, 2005, and Dec 31, 2015 in Japan. The primary outcome was favourable neurological outcome (Cerebral Performance Category of 1 or 2) at 30 days after the OHCA and the secondary outcome was survival at 30 days following the OHCA. This study is registered with the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry, UMIN000009918.Findings: We identified 28 019 patients with bystander-witnessed OHCA and shockable heart rhythm who had received CPR from a bystander. Of these, 2242 (8·0%) patients did not achieve return of spontaneous circulation with CPR plus public-access defibrillation, and 25 087 (89·5%) patients did not achieve return of spontaneous circulation with CPR alone before EMS arrival. The proportion of patients with a favourable neurological outcome was significantly higher in those who received public-access defibrillation than those who did not (845 [37·7%] vs 5676 [22·6%]; adjusted odds ratio [OR] after propensity score-matching, 1·45 [95% CI 1·24-1·69], p<0·0001). The proportion of patients who survived at 30 days after the OHCA was also significantly higher in those who received public-access defibrillation than those who did not ( Background: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) are a serious healthcare situation with low survival rates. Application of an automated external defibrillator (AED) by bystanders shortens time to defibrillation and increases survival. In Israel, a regulation ensuring the presence of AED in public places was issued and implemented since 2014. We investigated whether this regulation had an impact on the outcomes of OHCA patients.Methods: We performed a retrospective, single-center observational study. Included in the cohort were patients who were admitted to the department of intensive care cardiac unit with OHCA. Patients were stratified into two groups according to the year the regulation was introduced: group 1 (2009-2013) and group 2 (2014-2018) .Results: A total of 77 patients were included in group 1 and 61 in group 2. The utilization of AED was significantly higher in group 2 compared to group 1 (42% vs. 27%; P = 0.04). Compared to group 1 patients, group 2 had lower 48 h (0% vs. 8%; P = 0.02) and 30-day mortality (28% vs. 42%; P = 0.02). Cognitive damage following recovery was less frequent in group 2 (55% vs. 81%; P = 0.01).Conclusion: Deployment of AEDs in public places by mandatory regulations increased utilization for OHCA and may improve outcomes. 

Reviewer Comments (including whether meet criteria for formal review):

There is no new study to justify a scoping review or a systematic review. The rescuers could meet the 30:2 compression ratio and ensured the chest rose and fell adequately with breaths. Rescuer 3's CPR quality did not decrease during profound desaturations into the mid-70s. compression-only CPR at high altitude may deteriorate rescuer oxygenation, whereas CPR with breaths might ameliorateNo clinical studies were identified that actually addressed the criteria set out in the PICOST (fatigue in rescuers providing standard CPR vs compression only CPR). Simulation studies on manikins were identified, but the Basic Life Support Task Force did not find the results of these studies sufficient to challenge current guidelines and warrant a full review. A study suggesting additional factors such as wearing a face mask might influence fatigue during CPR. (Tian 2020) While not specifically searched for, future reviews will consider broadening the scope of this PICOST. The Basic Life Support Task Force did not find the results of the two case series/case reports sufficient to challenge current guidelines and warrant a full review. The Basic Life Support Task Force did not find the results of the single qualitative study sufficient to challenge current guidelines and warrant a full review. The Basic Life Support Task Force did not find the results of the observational studies sufficient to challenge current guidelines and warrant a full review. ("18334691" or "19660833" or "16564776" or "18374452" or "20370759" or "26550795" Median inspiratory tidal volume generated by manual chest compressions without ventilation was 20 mL (IQR 13, 28 mL) which were judged inadequate to provide adequate alveolar ventilation.Only a single study identified during the specified time window addressing provision of chest compressions with ventilation versus chest compressions alone in intubated patients, indicating that the tidal volume generated by chest compressions in an open airway is insufficient to provide alveolar ventilation. The study did not address arterial blood gas content nor EtCO2, nor ventilation in the non-intubated patient (although this would be expected to be either no different or resulting in lower tidal volumes if there is airway occlusion), nor clinical outcome. As such, the data would support provision of manual ventilation during the course of EMS CPR in order to achieve volumes sufficient to support alveolar ventilation, but not permit further extrapolation from this information. In sum, the interim evidence does not provide sufficient information to warrant updating this topic with a full systematic review. New observational evidence was identified during the evidence update process, and the BLS Task Force will be prioritizing this question for full systematic review in 2021. There is no new study to justify a scoping review or a systematic review. The Basic Life Support Task Force did not find the results of the three case series/case reports sufficient to challenge current guidelines and warrant a full review. Outcomes: Survival to hospital discharge with good neurological outcome and survival to hospital discharge were ranked as critical outcomes. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was ranked as an important outcome. CPR quality metrics such time chest compression fraction, pauses in compressions, compressions per minute, time to commencing CPR, or time to first shock etc. were included as important outcomes.The last title screening performed Feb 14 th identified two observational studies evaluating analysis during compressions in clinical settings. These are the first two clinical studies identified, and this topic will therefore be prioritized for full systematic review in 2021. This was a systematic review and we registered the protocol with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (CRD42019152925)This BLS PICOST question was addressed with two separate PubMed searches, one for 'tidal volumes' during CPR and a second for 'ventilation rates'. The searches together identified a total of 596 citations, which were screened initially on title and abstract. Sixteen papers were retrieved for review of the full-text, and all were assessed as not meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria. This review therefore concludes that there is no new science that would change, or initiate a revision, of the recommendations from the 2010 CoSTR. Outcomes: BLS371 addressed outcome in a generic sense (not specified); BLS 547 specifically addressed short-term and long-term outcomes, as well as CPR performance and quality measures.No new evidence was identified. Intervention: Does any particular factor in search-and-rescue operations (eg, duration of submersion, salinity of water, water temperature, age of victim)No new evidence identified

Qualitative study to explore the experiences of rescuers (n=9) Lay rescuers who had performed CPR and AED in public locations in Taiwan Event-to-interview duration was within 1 year (n = 4) and 1-2 years (n = 5).(1) the lay rescuers possessed helping traits and high motivation;(2) the lay rescuers reported certain aspects of rescue reality that differed much from prior training and expectations, including difficulty in the depth of chest compression, and uncertainties in real emergency situations;(3) the lay rescuers gained positive personal fulfillment in sharing their experience and receiving positive feedback from others, and were willing to help next time, although they experienced a short-term negative psychological impact from the event.Author conclusion:This study provides valuable information on strategies to increase layperson CPR rates and effectiveness in CPR training. Measures should be taken to increase layperson's confidence and situation awareness, reduce training-reality discrepancy, build up a support system to avoid negative psychological effects, and prepare lay rescuers for the next resuscitation.

Summary/Conclusion Comment(s)

Lakomek 2020Khorasani-Zadeh 2020 Author conclusion: The real-time feedback system improved chest compression quality regarding pauses in compression and compression frequency and facilitated compliance with the guideline recommendations. Compression depth did not change significantly after activation of the real-time feedback. Even the sole use of a CPR-feedback-sensor ("sensor-only CPR") improved performance regarding pauses in compression and compression frequency, a phenomenon known as the 'Hawthorne effect'. Based on this data real-time feedback systems can be expected to raise the quality level in some parts of chest compression quality.Author conclusion: Our data suggest that an inexpensive and widely available intervention may improve the quality of CPR

Cough CPR

We recommend against the routine use of cough CPR for cardiac arrest (strong recommendation, very-low-certainty evidence).We suggest that cough CPR may be considered only as a temporizing measure in exceptional circumstance of a witnessed, monitored IHCA (eg, in a cardiac catheterization laboratory) if a non-perfusing rhythm is recognized promptly before loss of consciousness (weak recommendation, very-low-certainty evidence).

Percussion (fist) pacing

We recommend against fist pacing for cardiac arrest (strong recommendation, very-low-certainty evidence).We suggest that fist pacing may be considered only as a temporizing measure in the exceptional circumstance of a witnessed, monitored, IHCA (eg, in a cardiac catheterization laboratory) due to bradyasystole if such a nonperfusing rhythm is recognized promptly before loss of consciousness (weak recommendation, very-low-certainty evidence).

Precordial thump

We recommend against the use of a precordial thump for cardiac arrest (strong recommendation, very-low-certainty evidence).

Last ILCOR Consensus on Science and Treatment Recommendation: 2020

• We continue to recommend that bystanders perform chest compressions for all patients in cardiac arrest (good practice statement)• We suggest that bystanders who are trained, able and willing to give rescue breaths and chst compressions do so for all adults in cardiac arrest (weak recommendation, very-low-certainty evidence) 1 exp Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation/ 2 (cardiopulmonary respiratory resuscitation$ or cardiopulmonary resuscitation$ or cardio pulmonary resuscitation$ or cardio-pulmonary resuscitation$ or CPR or Advanced Cardiac Life Support or basic cardiac life support or code blue or resuscitation$ mouth-to-mouth or mouthto-mouth resuscitation$ or mouth to mouth resuscitation$).tw.future randomized trials to establish conclusive results.

RCT:

Randomized Total number of "correct" (5-6 cm depth) CCs did not differ between the two groups; neither did average depth of CC, number of CCs >5 cm, CC rate per minute, recoil, time to exhaustion or level of exhaustion. Total hands off time was shorter in the chest compression-only group than in standard CPR group. The findings suggest no difference in CPR quality between the two CPR strategies apart from shorter hands-off time.Limitation of trial was manikinbased and relatively small in size to detect differences (underpowered). Reviewer Comments (including whether meet criteria for formal review): Two manikin trials addressing CPR quality with interrupted versus continuous chest compression CPR had differing outcomes; reassessment of the pooled results from 3 randomized clinical trials were inconclusive of a benefit of one CPR strategy over the other. And an observation study observed no difference in 30 day neurological outcome between the differing CPR strategies regardless of whether the arrest was due to asphyxia, non-asphyxial or cardiac causes. Interim information is insufficient to warrant updating this topic with a full systematic review. 

Comparators: compared with no factors

Outcomes: Survival to hospital discharge with good neurological outcome and survival to hospital discharge were ranked as critical outcomes. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was ranked as an important outcome.
