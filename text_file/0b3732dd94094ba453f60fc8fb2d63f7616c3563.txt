General Information

Unless otherwise indicated, all commercially available reagents were used directly from the supplier without further purification. Tetrahydrofuran (THF), dichloromethane (DCM), dimethylformamide (DMF), 1, diethyl ether (Et2O) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade and anhydrous. Ethyl acetate (EtOAc), Methanol (MeOH) and ethanol (EtOH) were analytical grade, and directly used without further purification.All microwave reactions were performed on a CEM TM Discover SP Microwave System. Infrared spectra were recorded in potassium bromide (KBr) pellets using a Nicolet AVATER FTIR380 spectrometer. All high-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were obtained on a Finnigan/MAT 95XL-T spectrometer. Optical rotation was obtained on an Anton Paar MCP-100 digital polarimeter using a 1 cm 3 glass cell. The melting points were measured by Buchi B-540 melting point apparatus. Analytical-HPLC was performed using Agilent reversed phase column (4.6 x 150 mm, pore size: 95 Å, particle size: 5 µm, phase: eclipse Plus C18, part number: 959993-902). 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR spectra were recorded at ambient temperature in DMSO-d6 (2.50 ppm for 1 H NMR, 39.52 ppm for 13 C NMR) or methanol-d4 (3.34 ppm for 1 H NMR, 49.0 ppm for 13 C NMR) using Bruker 400 MHz and Bruker 500 MHz spectrometers.Chemical shift values are expressed as parts per million (ppm), and J-values are in hertz (Hz) . Splitting patterns are indicated as s: singlet, d: doublet, t: triplet, q: quartet, p: pentet, or combination, brs: broad singlet, or m: multiplet. Analytic HPLC was performed using a Shimadzu Prominence System equipped with a Shim Pack GVP-ODS 2.0 mm C18 column (5 μM, 120Å, 250 mm x 4.60 mm i.d.) at room temperature. Preparative HPLC was performed using a Waters e2695 Separations Module equipped with a C18 column (Luna 5µM, C18(2) 100 Å, LC Column 250 × 10 mm) with a PDA detector at room temperature.The human lymphocytic leukemia (non-T, non-B) cell line (REH) and human T-lymphoblastic leukemia (MOLT4) were cultured in RPMI 1640 media ( HyClone, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, HyClone, CA, USA) and 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco, CA, USA). Cells were seeded in 96 well plates, followed by treatment of prexasertib derivatives for 48 hours. The Cell Counting Kit-8 colorimetric assay (CCK8, Dojindo, Japan) was used to determine the percentage of cell viability.

Serial Commands List

For the SF-10 reagent pump, Valco dead-end selector valve, and Hei-connect stir plate, the lists of serial commands can be found in their respective operation manuals or acquired from the manufacturers. Syrris Ltd provides a free application programming interface in C language for controlling the Asia pump from a computer. We used AsiaPumpInterface.h (Version 1.2, Oct 2017). The relevant provided DLL file was placed in the work directory. The functions in the DLL were converted to LabVIEW VI by using the share library converter in LabVIEW.Below is a list of all communication commands utilized, organized by hardware component. Supplementary Fig. 11 .

SF-10

The main process of the automation step is to move the valves to set port positions, fill the Asia pump if necessary, start both the SF-10 and Asia pumps simultaneously and start a built-in timer. Once the target duration has elapsed, the two pumps are stopped simultaneously, and the program will determine if the Asia pump needs to empty the syringes for the next step. Once the emptying process is finished, the program will read the next row conditions and repeat the whole process, starting from the setting of the valve port positions.One highlight of the program's functionality is the temperature adjustment. The Hei-Connect stir plate uses a built-in proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller to adjust the temperature. This controller has two modes, namely, precise-mode, which avoids an overshoot in the sample temperature, and fast-mode, in which the heater will heat rapidly but in our testing the overshoot could be as large as 15 °C. We chose to use the stir plate's precise-mode in our program, and in addition to this built-in control, we added the functionality that any pumps that are pumping will be paused whenever the measured temperature of the oil bath is out of a user-defined acceptable temperature range. After the pumps pause, the program will wait for the temperature to return to a different defined range of the set temperature plus or minus one. By setting two temperature ranges, one for pausing pumps (±5 °C) and the other for resuming pumps (±1 °C), the pumps do not rapidly switch on and off when the temperature is at the edge of the user set temperature range. This approach results in a reliable temperature and more precise pumping times. In addition to the temperature adjustment functionality, another highlight of the program is the ability for users to pause the pumps whenever they are pumping. The pause functionality was vital during the developmental stage of the chemical process; it allowed a chemist user much flexibility in modifying the process. 

Condition Table

The condition table is a user-defined table containing the information of duration, flow rate of pump1 and pump2, port position of valve 1-4, hot plate temperature and rotation speed. We modified the condition table in Microsoft Excel and saved it as a tab delimited text file. To correctly interpret the condition table in LabVIEW TM , the titles and units in the text file match the table titles shown in the LabVIEW TM program user interface window. For the heating and cooling steps, we set the duration to "x" or "0" in the condition table, since the duration of this step depends on the stir plate heating speed and cooling speed.

Start from row number

Set the program to start from a user-defined step. The skipped steps are grayed out, and the current step is highlighted with a yellow background.

Serial Configuration

Set the serial communication between the instrument and computer, including COM port number, baud rate, parity and data bits. The automation program has default serial parameters corresponding to each instrument, although the COM port number is dependent on the user's computer. The Syrris Asia pump hardware did not require serial configuration. After installing the driver, the pump was automatically detected by the computer.

Syringe Type

Set the syringe types loaded into the left and right channels of the Syrris Asia pump to calculate the maximum filling and emptying speed. Note that it is required to set the syringe types directly on the pump interface and to ensure that the same syringe types are specified in the automation program.

Temp Range

Set the acceptable temperature range for the sample. Since the PID heating control system inevitably has fluctuations in temperature, this program includes the functionality of running the process only within the acceptable temperature range to ensure a good outcome of the product. Once the temperature measured by the sensor is out of this range, the automation program will pause the timer and pumps and resume once the temperature is accurate again.

State machine

The program follows a state machine structure for executing the flow system process. Here, we describe the state machine logic that the control program is built around.

Start operation (default):

This state is the default beginning state when the program enters the state machine structure. It checks if the condition table has entries and sends the initialize command to the Syrris Asia pump.1. if the row number is greater than 0:send initialize command to Syrris Asia pump go to next state "Initialize" else: stay in the current state prompt: no entries

Reset pumps indicators

Initialize: This state is used to wait for the Syrris Asia pump to finish the initializing process for both channels. This process will take several minutes. During this process, the operation buttons (START, STOP, PAUSE) are disabled in order to prevent intervention in initializing Syrris Asia pump. Intervening in this process may cause the pump to inaccurately determine its home position.1. if both the left channel state and right channel state are at initialized: go to next state "Wait to start" else: stay in the current state Wait to start: After completion of the "Initialize" state, the START and STOP buttons are enabled in this state. The "Wait to start" state is used to wait for the user to start the process by pressing the START button, or to exit the program by pressing the STOP button. 1. if a temperature is set in the current row: send command to Hei-connect to set the temperature send command to Hei-connect to turn on the heater else:send command to Hei-connect to turn off the heater 2. if a rotation speed is set in the current row:send command to Hei-connect to set the rpm send command to Hei-connect to turn on the motor else:send command to Hei-connect to turn off the motor 3. if the duration is not set in the current row:# meaning the current row is a heating or cooling step, the actual duration of this row depends on the stir plate heating performance go to state "Wait to reach temperature" else: go to state "Fill syringe pump"

Wait to reach temp:

This state is used to wait for the oil bath to reach the set temperature. During this state, the timer will be paused.1. pause the timer 2. if the current temperature is within 1 degree around the set temperature: go to state "Resume pumps" else: stay in the current state

Fill syringe pump:

In this state, the Syrris Asia pump will fill the syringes if needed. There are two cases where the syringes need to be filled before pumping:1. The set flow rate is nonzero, and the valve 2 position has changed from the previous row 2. The set flow rate is nonzero, and the valve 2 position is the same as the previous row, but the set flowrate from the previous row is zero; i.e., the pump did not run in the previous row and was not filled with solution. This state continually updates the timer and measured temperature in cycles. The two cases that will cause the process to pause are as follows: 1. The measured temperature is not within the userdefined temperature range; 2. The user presses the PAUSE button. If either of the two cases occur, the process will go to the state "Pause pumps"; otherwise, it will stay in the current state until the set duration has elapsed and then go to state "Stop pumps".1. if set temperature is nonzero but the measured temperature is not in the range around set temperature, or user presses PAUSE button: go to state "Pause pumps" else if the elapsed time has reached the set duration: go to state "Stop pumps" else: stay in the current state

Pause pumps:

This state pauses the running pumps and timer. If the user pressed the PAUSE button, this state will wait for the user to press the PAUSE button again to resume the process. Otherwise, if the pause state was triggered by an out-of-range measured temperature, this state will lead to the state "Wait to reach temp". Stop pumps: This state determines whether the Syrris Asia pump syringes need to be emptied before going to the next step. It will wait until the emptying process is completed and then go to the next state.There are two cases where the syringes need to be emptied: 1. The flow rate of the finished step is nonzero, but the flow rate of the next step is zero, i.e. the pump does not need to pump in the next step; 2. The flow rate of the finished step is nonzero, but the valve 2 port position needs to change for the next row.If either one or both syringes need to be emptied, the process will stay in this state and wait for both syringes to get ready for the next state. If neither of the syringes need to be emptied, it will go to the next state "Check next step". This state checks if the next row in the condition table has entries. If it does, the program will repeat the process from the state "Set valve position"; otherwise, the whole process has finished, and the program will clear indicators in the interface, close the communcation and exit 1. if the set duration, flow rates of two pumps, temperature and rotation speed of stir plate are all zero: go to state "No more entries" else: go to state "Set valves position"

Suggested operation procedure

In this chapter, we walk through an operation procedure for using the SPS Flow System Automation program to conduct a production process.• Prepare the condition table: Fill in the condition table (in the form of an Excel file, Supplementary Table 3) , and save as a Tab delimited .txt file Note: The heating and cooling steps require entering "x" or "0" under Duration (Minutes); otherwise, the system may not reach the expected temperature. In the next row, enter the duration and conditions that you would like the system to perform at the expected temperature.Note: For steps that do not need to be conducted at a specific temperature, enter "off" under Temperature (Celsius)• Setup hardware: Setup the instruments, connect the system tubing and prepare the solutions • Connect to computer: Connect instruments to the computer via USB cable and USB hub. Contact the instrument manufacturers for detailed connection information.• Setup the communication: Open the SPS Flow System Automation program. Select the COM port corresponding to each instrument, except the Syrris Asia pump, which is automatically connected (refer to Syrris Asia pump Interface Library Reference Version 1.2). Refer to the communication configurations stated in each instrument's user manual.• Input parameters: Select the syringe types used in the Syrris Asia pump. Set the acceptable temperature range in degree Celsius.• Run the program: Click the run arrow to run the program Table on the user interface. The program will start initializing the Syrris Asia pump. Once the initialization is completed and the START button is enabled, it is ready to start the process • Start the process by clicking the START button• Pause/Stop the process if needed: During the process, if users need to pause or terminate the procedure, they can press the PAUSE or STOP button. If the procedure is paused, all pumps will stop pumping, the program timer will pause timing, and these will be resumed after the user resumes the process by pressing the PAUSE button again. If the procedure is terminated by pressing the STOP button, the program will stop and exit after closing communication with the instruments. Note: If the program is stopped when the Syrris Asia pump syringes are not empty, they will not be emptied automatically; they will be emptied in the initialization process when you run the program again. Note: It is not recommended to abort the program using the Abort button , since the program will not stop pumps if it is aborted. Use the STOP button instead.• Wait for the process to finish automatically.

Bioactivity evaluation

The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of prexasertib was first determined in a human lymphocytic leukemia REH cell line (IC50= 4.57 nM) and a T-lymphoblastic leukemia Molt-4 cell line (IC50=0.89 nM). The anti-cancer activity of a series of prexasertib analogs was evaluated by CCK8 assay using concentrations of 7.5 nM and 1.5 nM in REH and Molt4, respectively. Preliminary evaluation suggests that prexasertib 7 remains the most potent compound among all the tested derivatives.
