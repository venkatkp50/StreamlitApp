Strengths and limitations of this study

-Reducing the selection pressure by reducing the duration to antibiotics in patients with community-acquired infections is a major public health issue.-In critically ill patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), molecular tests and biomarkers may be combined to guide antibiotic therapy.-The MULTI-CAP trial is a multicenter, parallel-group, open-label, superiority randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy and safety of an original management strategy to usual care in CAP patients admitted to the intensive care unit.-The original management strategy combines a broad panel respiratory mPCR and procalcitonin to an algorithm of early antibiotic de-escalation or discontinuation, based on early microbiological results, including the mPCR results, and the procalcitonin value.-The primary endpoint is the number of antibiotic-free days at Day-28, defined as the number of days alive without any antibiotic, neither intravenous nor oral, from the randomization to Day-28. At the time of the dramatic emergence of bacterial resistance, reducing the selection pressure by reducing the exposure to antibiotics in patients with community-acquired pneumonia is a major public health issue. In this context, the combined use of broad panel respiratory multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) tests that may improve microbiological diagnosis and biomarkers such as procalcitonin for guiding antibiotics discontinuation is attractive. Therefore, we have designed a trial comparing an integrated approach of diagnosis and treatment of severe community-acquired pneumonia to usual care.

Methods and analysis

The MULTI-CAP trial is a multicenter (n = 20), parallel-group, superiority, open-label, randomized controlled trial. In the experimental strategy arm, the microbiological diagnosis combines a broad panel respiratory mPCR and conventional microbiological investigations.An algorithm of early antibiotic de-escalation or discontinuation is recommended, based on early microbiological results, including the mPCR results, and the procalcitonin value. In the usual strategy, only conventional microbiological investigations are performed and antibiotics de-escalation remains at the clinician's discretion. The primary endpoint is the number of antibiotic-free days at Day-28, calculated as the number of days alive without any antibiotic from the randomization to Day-28. Based on our hypothesis of two days gains in the experimental group, we aim to enroll 450 patients over a 30-month recruitment period.The MULTI-CAP trial is a multicenter (n=20), parallel-group, superiority, open-label, 

Ethics and dissemination

The MULTI-CAP trial is conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.The present trial is registered in Clinical Trials (NCT03452826) and has been approved by the Committee for Protection of Persons and the National French Drug Safety Agency. Written informed consents are obtained from all the patients (or representatives). The results of this trial will be disseminated to the participating hospitals and through educational institutions, submitted to peer-reviewed journals for publication, and presented at medical congresses. incidence is estimated about 1.6 to 9 cases per 1000 habitants in Europe (1) . The admission to the intensive care units (ICUs) concerns 10 to 20% of inpatients with CAP, with a median duration of ICU stay of 7 days and a mortality reaching up to 50% (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) . Bacterial microorganisms constitute the main group of pathogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae being the predominant bacterium. However, the role of respiratory viruses has been highlighted in the last decade, with the routine availability of nucleic-acid amplification tests. Therefore, at least four series have reported results from a wide use of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) tests in ICU patients with CAP (7) (8) (9) (10) , with a rate of viral documentation ranging from 23 to 49% of cases.In patients with severe CAP, the recommended empirical antibiotic therapy is a combination of broad-spectrum intravenous therapies, targeting Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, enterobacteriaceae, Legionella Sp. and atypical micro-organisms (11) (12) (13) . Antibiotic therapy has to be reassessed after 48-72 hours of therapy (11, 13, 14) . In case of microbiological documentation, spectrum should be narrowed. This targeting is promoted by scientific societies (11, 15) , and is justified by ecological and economic considerations (13, 16, 17) . However, antibiotic deescalation is only occasionally performed by clinicians in hospitalized patients with CAP (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) . Reasons are many, inherent to beliefs and convictions of clinicians, and to logistical and organizational constraints (23) . Moreover, a beneficial impact of antibiotic de-escalation has not been clearly established in severe CAP (18, 24, 25) . In term of treatment duration, antibiotic therapy in CAP inpatients should not be administered for more than 8 days (11) , and even less (15, 26) , except for cases with documented difficult-to-eradicate bacteria such as P. aeruginosa and S. aureus and complicated, i.e. with excavation or pleural empyema. This duration might be safely shortened to 5 days when clinical response to the treatment is favorable (15, 26) . However, series of inpatients with CAP have reported a median duration of antibiotic treatment of more than 10 days (27, 28 (29) (30) (31) (32) .Another way for reducing antibiotic exposure is to use procalcitonin, an interesting biomarker for the etiological diagnosis of CAP. Procalcitonin has been used to guide antibiotics initiation and/or discontinuation in lower respiratory tract infections (33, 34) , in addition to microbiological investigations and clinical judgement (35, 36) . Specifically, its performance to discriminate patients with and without bacterial coinfection during viral pneumonia such as Flu is attractive (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) . To date, only one trial has assessed the therapeutic impact of a proactive diagnostic strategy combining a respiratory mPCR (17 viruses and 3 intracellular bacteria) and the procalcitonin measurement. This single-center randomized controlled trial included 300 inpatients with non-pneumonic lower respiratory tract infections. In the intervention arm, procalcitonin measurement and mPCR were performed, and an usual procalcitonin-guided algorithm of antibiotics discontinuation was proposed to clinicians. The primary endpoint (total duration of antibiotic therapy) did not differ between the two groups (42) .Combining a respiratory broad panel mPCR and procalcitonin could be an innovative approach for lower the overall antibiotics exposure. Indeed, with increasing the sensitivity of the microbial diagnosis, antibiotic de-escalation should be facilitated; with better identifying patients without bacterial pneumonia, antibiotics discontinuation should be also accelerated.Antibiotic saving may reduce the selection pressure, the incidence of colonization with multidrug-resistant or highly resistant bacteria, and the incidence of ICU-acquired superinfections. It may result in a lower use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, a lower morbidity and a subsequent lower overall cost of hospital care.We thus designed a trial to compare two diagnostic and therapeutic management strategies of severe CAP.

Standard of care

The usual strategy (control arm) is based on the standard of care for CAP, in accordance with international guidelines (11, 14, 15) . Conventional microbiological investigations are performed as soon as possible after ICU admission, including blood cultures, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila urine antigen assays, and a respiratory tract sample for Gram stain examination and two-day quantitative culture (11, 14, 15) . The respiratory tract sample may be non-invasive (sputum) or invasive (bronchoalveolar lavage, protected distal sample or tracheal aspirate, under fiberoptic guidance or blindly), at the clinician's discretion.Legionella pneumophila urine antigen assay may be repeated after 24 (11, 14, 15) . All these microbiological samples will be analyzed in the routine microbiology laboratory of each center, and their results communicated to the clinicians as soon as possible, as per usual care.All the biological investigations are performed at the clinician's discretion, except the dosage of plasma concentration of procalcitonin at inclusion, twelve hours after inclusion, then daily from Day 3 to Day 7. ICU physicians are encouraged to perform a chest-X-ray at inclusion.Chest CT-scan may be performed at the clinician's discretion, as per usual care.Antibiotics are started as soon as possible after ICU admission, provided that patients may be already treated with antibiotics at ICU referral. The recommended empirical antibiotic therapy is an intravenous combination of a third-generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) with a macrolide (spiramycin) or an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin), except for patients with risk factors for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and/or Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, in accordance with guidelines (11, 14, 15 The usual strategy (control arm) is based on the standard of care for CAP, in accordance with international guidelines (11, 14, 15) . Conventional microbiological investigations are performed as soon as possible after ICU admission, including blood cultures, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila urine antigen assays, and a respiratory tract sample for Gram stain examination and two-day quantitative culture (11, 14, 15) . The respiratory tract sample may be non-invasive (sputum) or invasive (bronchoalveolar lavage, protected distal sample or tracheal aspirate, under fiberoptic guidance or blindly), at the clinician's discretion. Mycoplasma pneumoniae, antibody blood testing combined to PCR (simplex PCR) on a distal respiratory tract sample are encouraged (11, 14, 15) . All these microbiological samples will be analyzed in the routine microbiology laboratory of each center, and their results communicated to the clinicians as soon as possible, as per usual care.All the biological investigations are performed at the clinician's discretion, except the dosage of plasma concentration of procalcitonin at inclusion, twelve hours after inclusion, then daily from Day-3 to Day-7. ICU physicians are encouraged to perform a chest-X-ray at inclusion.Chest CT-scan may be performed at the clinician's discretion, as per usual care.Patients may have been treated with antibiotics before ICU referral, e.g. in the emergency room, given the severity of pneumonia. Otherwise, antibiotics have to be started as soon as possible after ICU admission. The recommended empirical antibiotic therapy is an intravenous combination of a third-generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) with a macrolide or an anti-pneumococcal fluoroquinolone, except for patients with risk factors for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and/or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, in accordance with guidelines (11, 14, 15) .

Intervention

In the intervention arm (experimental strategy), in addition to conventional microbiological investigations, a respiratory tract sample [either invasive (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or tracheal aspirate) or non-invasive (sputum)] is collected as soon as possible (in maximum 12hours after randomization). The sample is transported to the routine microbiology laboratory of each center and the respiratory broad panel mPCR FA-PPP is performed.Before the end of Day-1, clinicians have to consider all the early microbiological results (mPCR FA-PPP, urine antigen assays, blood cultures, and Gram stain examination of respiratory tract sample) and procalcitonin, and subsequently to apply an algorithm of early antibiotics discontinuation or de-escalation ( Figure 2) . Briefly, discontinuation is encouraged in case of no bacterial documentation and a procalcitonin < 1 ng/mL; discontinuation is even strongly encouraged if a viral documentation is concurrently obtained. Otherwise, antibiotics continuation is encouraged, but with narrowing the spectrum as much as possible (deescalation 

Endpoints

The primary endpoint is the number of antibiotic-free days at Day-28, defined as the number of days alive without any antibiotic, neither intravenous nor oral, from the randomization to Day-28. Patients who die before Day-28 have a 0 value. Secondary endpoints, related to the effectiveness and safety of the experimental strategy, are listed in Table 1 .The primary endpoint is the number of antibiotic-free days at Day-28, defined as the number of days alive without any antibiotic, neither parenteral nor enteral, from the randomization to 

Sample size

Based on the previous PRORATA study (27) , a number of days alive without antibiotics of 11±7 days is expected. A sample size of 450 patients would provide 80% power to detect a 2 days gain in the experimental strategy group considering a two-sided alpha of 5% and a nonparametric test and 10% of dropout.

Main statistical analysis

Statistical analysis will be performed at the end of the trial after blinded review and database lock. The statistician will be blinded from the treatment allocation. Principal analysis will be performed on the intention-to-treat population defined as all patients as randomized. Baseline characteristics of patients will be described in each group. Qualitative data will be reported as frequencies and percentages; quantitative as mean and standard error or as median and interquartile interval , depending on the variable distribution. The primary endpoint will be compared using Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney nonparametric test.Effect size and its 95% confidence interval will be given. The period of interest will begin at the randomization date. Sensitivity analyses will be performed, by using generalized linear model with Poisson distribution for the number of antibiotic free days at Day-28. In case of data overdispersion, generalized linear model with negative binomial distribution could be preferred. Furthermore, cumulative-event curves will be assessed with the Kaplan-Meier method, and hazard ratio estimate will be calculated using Cox proportional hazard model.Analysis on secondary endpoints will be extensively detailed in the statistical plan.No imputation strategy of missing value is planned, with the exception of the main endpoint.Single imputation will be made under the failure assumption (i.e. 0 value). All tests will be two-sided and a P-value < 0.05 will indicate statistical significance. Statistical analysis will be performed using SAS V9.4 software (SAS Institute Inc).Statistical analysis will be performed at the end of the trial after blinded review and database lock.

Sensitivity analyses will be performed considering the best-case scenario and the per protocol population (all patients as randomized and treated without major protocol violation identified before data base lock). Secondary analyses will be performed, by using generalized linear model with Poisson distribution for the number of antibiotic free days at Day-28 considering the worst-case scenario and multiple imputation for missing data as sensitivity analysis. In case of data overdispersion, generalized linear model with negative binomial distribution could be preferred. Furthermore, cumulativeevent curves will be assessed with the Kaplan-Meier method, and hazard ratio estimate will be calculated using stratified Cox proportional hazard model. Secondary endpoints will be analyzed on available data. Analysis on secondary endpoints will be extensively detailed in the statistical plan. All tests will be two-sided and a P-value < 0.05 will indicate statistical significance. Statistical analysis will be performed using SAS V9.4 software (SAS Institute Inc).

Cost-effectiveness analysis

The economic evaluation of the effectiveness of the experimental strategy (intervention arm), as compared to the usual strategy (control arm) will follow the recommendations the CHEERS statement for single trial based economic evaluations (44) . The primary endpoint is the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio using the composite endpoint (Day-90 composite of all-cause death and infection recurrence) as effectiveness criterion. The choice of a costeffectiveness study for the primary analysis was prompted by low expected impact of antibiotic de-escalation on the quality of life. The analysis will be conducted from the perspective of the French healthcare system (limited to the hospital and based on the entire population of patients included in the trial). Resources will be collected prospectively at the patient level. The study is planned, undertaken, and will be analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle The cost of the panel, procalcitonin and antibiotics will be estimated for each patient in both arms.Medical care costs for the index hospitalization and in-trial follow-up period are assessed using a combination of resource-based and event-based methods. The total costs of the initial hospital admission will be estimated from the time of admission (it is not possible to estimate the stay from the time of randomization only) using the total length of stay and ICU length of stay combined with the specific DRG costs (not charges) extracted from the hospitals claims database. Readmissions (up to Day-90) will be included in the cost calculations, using the specific DRG costs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER: difference in total Day-90 costs / difference in Day-90 all-cause death and infection recurrence) will be calculated in the intervention and control arms. Resource use data will be presented as means with standard error of the mean despite non-normal distribution because they better represent per patient data than median values, and compared using nonparametric test. Costs, Day-90 death and recurrence will be presented as means with 2.5 to 97.5% bootstrapped intervals. Betweengroup comparisons of costs will be performed using the bootstrap t-test. Between-group comparisons of effects will be performed using nonparametric test. A joint comparison of costs and effects will be performed by nonparametric bootstrapping with 1,000 resamples. A distribution will be attributed to each variable according to accepted practice and the result of the bootstrap replications will be presented on the cost-effectiveness plan.The 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y on the cost-effectiveness plane to estimate the probability that the intervention is incrementally or decrementally cost effective.

Expected outcomes

To the best of our knowledge, the MULTI-CAP trial is the first to investigate the impact of a diagnosis and therapeutic management strategy, combining a broad panel respiratory mPCR and the procalcitonin in severe CAP patients. The algorithm of early antibiotics de-escalation or discontinuation should enable to use antibiotics lesser and better in patients randomized in the intervention arm. If our hypothesis is demonstrated, in terms of efficacy (diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis) and cost-effectiveness, this may change practice and make this proactive diagnostic and therapeutic approach a future standard or care. Indeed, by illustrating the direct benefit to the patient in terms of antibiotic saving and morbidity/mortality such as ICU-acquired superinfections in one hand, and environmental and economic benefits in hospital and across the community on the other hand, we will encourage the use of these tests through the medical community. Therefore, their use in CAP patients might increase, with expected ecological and economic benefits for the whole community.To the best of our knowledge, the MULTI-CAP trial is the first to investigate the impact of a diagnosis and therapeutic management strategy, combining a broad panel respiratory mPCR and the procalcitonin in severe CAP patients.

Introduction

At the time of the worrying emergence and spread of bacterial resistance, reducing the selection pressure by reducing the exposure to antibiotics in patients with communityacquired pneumonia (CAP) is a public health issue. In this context, the combined use of molecular tests and biomarkers for guiding antibiotics discontinuation is attractive. Therefore, we have designed a trial comparing an integrated approach of diagnosis and treatment of severe CAP to usual care.

Randomization

Eligible ICU patients (or their next of kin depending of the patient's situation) are informed about the trial by clinician. Once written informed consent has been given, eligible patients 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y are randomized using a Web-based system (Cleanweb™, Telemedecine Technologies, S.A.S.) and assigned either to control or to intervention arm in 1:1 ratio. Randomization has to be performed before the 18 th hour following ICU admission. Balanced-block randomization is computer-generated and stratified on participating site. Different widths of random permutation blocks were used and were not communicated to the sites.

Follow-up

Patients are followed for 90 days, with daily visits during 7 days, at discharge (or Day-28 whatever comes first) and at Day-90. Visits are performed by investigators. In case of hospital discharge prior to Day-28, patient's vital status and antibiotic exposure after hospital discharge are collected by phone calls to patient or his/her next-of-kin or general practitioner.Similarly, information regarding hospital readmission is collected by phone at Day-90.

Patients and public involvement

Patients and/or the public were not involved in the design, or conduct, or analysis, or reporting plans of the MULTI-CAP trial.

Data availability statement

De-identified individual-participant data underlying the findings described in the manuscript of the study will be available and shared upon reasonable request through an approving committee. Consultation by an editorial board may be considered, subject to prior determination of the terms and conditions of such consultation and with respect to compliance with the applicable regulations.

Figure 1 Trial design

In the intervention arm, before the end of Day-1, clinicians have to consider all the early microbiological results (mPCR FA-PPP, urine antigen assays, blood cultures, and Gram stain examination of respiratory tract sample) and procalcitonin before the end of Day-1, and subsequently to apply an algorithm of early antibiotics discontinuation or de-escalation (red square). This algorithm is described in Figure 2 .In both arms, at Day-3 and day after day until Day-7, clinicians are encouraged to consider antibiotic discontinuation, based on procalcitonin values and kinetics. Abbreviations: CAP= Community-acquired pneumonia; ICU= Intensive Care Unit; mPCR= multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction

Figure 2. Algorithm of early antibiotics de-escalation or discontinuation

The algorithm is applied in the intervention arm only (see red square, Figure 1 ). According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, a multidrug resistant bacterium is an isolate that is resistant to at least one antibiotic in three or more drug classes. Relapse of pneumonia is defined as a new episode of pneumonia, after an initial clinically significant improvement, documented to the same pathogen, from inclusion to Day-28. The performance of the mPCR will be assessed only for the bacterial targets of the panel. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60
