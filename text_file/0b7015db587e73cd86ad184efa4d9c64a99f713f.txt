Sample Collection Details and Laboratory Preparation

Protocol based on collection of 1 X EDTA tube, 2 X Ficoll tube, and 1 X mid-turbinate nasal swab (MTNS) . For all visits except Week 0 and Week 12, only 1 X Ficoll tube will be collected. A Tasso serum separator tube (SST) may also be collected if participants opt into that sub-study. Study staff will leave Ficoll (and Tasso SST, if collected) tubes at room temperature in a BSL2 biosafety cabinet (BSC) and EDTA tubes and MTNS samples at 4°C.Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to be isolated and stored only on samples from baseline visit and week 12 visit or if rapid diagnostic test (RDT) is positive for IgM or IgG.Before Starting:• Turn on water bath to 56°C • Prepare 10% bleach solution in waste bucket, place waste bucket inside hood • Print labels based on guideline belowAt the beginning of each day of processing, use the manifest of visits and chain of custody forms that day to print labels for sample tubes • If no PBMCs will be collected, you will need 7 labels • If PBMCs will be collected, you will need 13 labels a. Let dry in the biosafety hood (can also be overnight). b. Once dry, place into a plastic storage bag labeled with a sample ID# c. Store DBS in plastic storage bag at -80°C 6. Take a photo of the RDT result with participant ID label visible using the digital camera.a. Save photos on the encrypted drive. 7. Once RDTs are completed, move to the next step.Protocol Plasma Processing and PBMC Collection:1. Use the two Ficoll tubes for this sample processing. Processing should start within 2 hours of collection. 2. Record time of the start of processing on the Sample Tracking spreadsheet 3. Centrifuge the two Ficoll tubes at 1,600 X g for 30 minutes at 22°C using the Sorvall ST16R centrifuge (during this time, can process the nasal swab)Plasma Collection from Ficoll Tubes: 1. Label 2 X 2ml cryovials with sample ID# label 2. Label 1 X 15ml Falcon tube with sample ID# label 3. Remove plasma (top clear yellow layer) from Ficoll tubes into a 15ml falcon tube using a 10ml pipette. Do not disturb the hazy layer below. You may leave some plasma. 4. Confirm caps of 15ml Falcon tubes are on tight. 5. If the sample is moving on to harvest PBMC, store tubes of plasma at 4°C and move to step 1 of PBMC Collection from Ficoll Tubes (only proceed if RDT positive or a sample collected at enrollment, 0 weeks, or 12 weeks) . 6. Return back to complete plasma aliquoting during the first PBS wash of PBMC Collection process. 7. Heat inactivate the plasma for 30 minutes at 56°C, mix every 5 minutes. 8. Bring 15ml Falcon tube to Eppendorf 5702 centrifuge and spin 1,500 X g for 10 minutes to pellet red blood cells and protein aggregate. 9. Bring back inside BSC. 10 . Carefully transfer 1.5ml of the supernatant (plasma) using 2ml pipette into two 2-ml sterile cryovials with screw top lids with O-rings using a sterile pipette tip. 11. Cap vials and place into freezer storage boxes in the -80°C freezer.PBMC collection: 5 1. Label a 15ml Falcon tube with sample ID#.2. Label 5 cryovials with sample ID#. 3. Transfer the remaining plasma and the whitish, mononuclear layer (everything above the gel layer) using a serological pipette, to a 15 ml Falcon tube, pooling the mononuclear layer from each Ficoll containing vacutainer per sample ID# into one conical tube. 4. Add 1x PBS to bring the total volume in the conical tube to 15 ml. 5. Cap tube and invert 5 times. 6. Centrifuge (with brake and acceleration OFF) 20 min, 500 x g, 22°C. 7. Return the conical tube to the hood and aspirate all but ~500 µl of the PBS without disturbing the pellet. (PBMC yield is greater if ~200 µl of PBS is left above the pellet at this stage). 8. Add fresh 1x PBS to bring the volume to 10 ml. Resuspend the pellet gently. Cap tube and invert 5 times. Centrifuge (with brake and acceleration OFF) 20 min, 500 x g, 22 °C 9. Aspirate as much supernatant/PBS as possible without disturbing the pellet. Resuspend pellet by adding in 1.5ml PBMC Freezing Medium 1. 10. Add 1.5ml PBMC Freezing Medium 2 to the cell/medium solution. Vortex gently. 11. Aliquot 10 µl of the cell solution into a 0.65 ml microcentrifuge tube. Add 10 µl of 0.4% trypan blue stain into the 0.65 ml microcentrifuge tube and mix by pipetting several times. 12. Pipette 20 µl of the mixture into a cell counting chamber slide (SD100 Cellometer) andplace slide into the cell counter within 3 min of mixing. Zoom in and focus the cells. Press the "Count Cells" to obtain PBMC count.

If the viable PBMC number is between 3 and 6 million live cells per milliliter (mc/ml),

aliquot 1mL into each cryovial. Store PBMCs in up to 3 cryovials at a concentration of at least 3 mc/ml each. 14. If the viable PBMC number is above 6 million cells per milliliter, add equal parts of Freezing Medium 1 and Freezing Medium 2 to get concentration to be between 3 and 6 mc/ml. Aliquot 1mL into each cryovial. 15. If the viable PBMC number is below 3 mc/ml , calculate the total number of cells using an excel spreadsheet calculator or by multiplying the viable mc/ml by 3 ml (which is the total volume the cells are in at this time) and by 2 (which is the trypan blue dilution factor). Determine a final volume so that the concentration is at least 3mc/mL. a. Centrifuge the conical tube containing the cells/freezing medium solution for 5 min at 300 x g (brake and acceleration OFF). After centrifugation, aspirate the appropriate volume of freezing medium (supernatant) so the amount remaining is the final volume calculated above. b. Resuspend the pellet in the remaining supernatant and aliquot at least 3 mc/ml into the appropriate number of cryovials (1-4) at 1 ml/cryovial. Final freezing medium is 10% Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO)/20% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS)/70% Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640. c. Document the cell count per cryovial and the number the cryovials and record the cell concentration for each vial.Transfer the cryovials to a controlled rate freezing container (Mr.Freezy, must add isopropanol to Mr Freezy before use) and put at -80ºC for at least 12 hr after which time the cryovials may be transferred to a cryobox and put in a liquid nitrogen tank (vapor phase) for long term storage. a. Ensure that the swing bucket rotor is in the Eppendorf 5702 centrifuge. In the BSC, label 0.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes for each participant. b. Spin samples at 1500 x g for 10 minutes. If a balance is needed, use a microcentrifuge tube filled with water. c. In the hood, aliquot serum into a labeled 0.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. d. Store samples in the study freezer box in a -80°C freezer.

Secondary Antibodies

• Goat anti-human IgG (Sigma), IgA (Abcam) and IgM (Sigma) are each diluted at 1:2500 in Blocking Buffer prior to use.

Note:

When preparing secondary antibody mixture, ensure you have 5 mL of blocking buffer. When preparing PNPP mixture, ensure you have 5 mL of DD water. If the volume is less than 5mL, you will run out of the mixture prematurely.

ELISA sample prep:

• Create an ELISA layout with each sample to be tested in duplicate.• Samples, controls (Negative and positive controls) ○ First spin samples and controls at 840xg for 5min ○ Dilute to 1:20 in Blocking Buffer in BSC.
