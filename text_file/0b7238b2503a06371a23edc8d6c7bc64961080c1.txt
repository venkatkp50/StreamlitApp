A third mRNA-based "booster" vaccination is the currently favored strategy to maintain protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Yet, significant waning of specific immunity within six months after 2 nd vaccination 1 , along with higher incidence of breakthrough infections associated with the time elapsed since 2 nd vaccination 2, 3 raises concerns regarding the durability of immunity also after 3 rd vaccination.We compared the specific humoral and cellular response ( Fig.1A -C) after 3 rd vs. 2 nd vaccination with BNT162b2 in a cohort of adults aged >80 years (sTable1,2 4 ) at risk for severe COVID-19 and immune senescence. Our data demonstrate the induction of marginally higher spike S1-specific blood IgG concentrations two weeks after 3 rd than after 2 nd vaccination (sFig.1A, Fig.1D ). By contrast, functionally relevant RBDspecific IgG (Fig.1B) and SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibody (sFig.1B) titers were substantially increased (Fig.1D ) after 3 rd compared to 2 nd vaccination, reflecting enhanced antibody production and/or affinity maturation.In contrast, spike-specific CD4 T cell frequencies reached similar levels after 2 nd and 3 rd vaccination (Fig.1C,D) . After the respective acute response, frequencies returned to approximately pre-vaccination levels with similar rates of decline after 2 nd and 3 rd vaccination (week 24 and 40, respectively, Fig.1C ,E, sFig.2). Quantified cytoplasmic expression of the effector cytokine IFNindicated functional enhancement of spikespecific T cells upon 2 nd but not further upon 3 rd vaccination, while more cytoplasmic IFNwas found in spike-specific CD4 T cells from senior adults recovered from COVID-19 (Fig.1F) . Thus, even a third BNT162b2 dose failed to induce durably enhanced quantities of spike-specific T cells and a functional quality reached after natural infection.Concentrations of S1-and RBD-specific IgG also declined from the acute responses at week 5 and week 26, but clearly at a lower rate after 3 rd (week 40) compared to 2 nd (week 24) vaccination ( Fig.1B ,E, sFig.1A, sFig.2), yielding persistently enhanced IgG quantity and/or quality after the 3 rd vaccination.

Thus, the apparent inability of older adults to develop and maintain high levels of fully matured SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells after 3 rd vaccination is of concern. Additional immunizations with vaccines designed to target "variants of concern" and improve T cell reactivity will be required to satisfactorily protect senior adults from COVID-19. respectively.

Study participants

Up to six blood samples were obtained from participants aged >80 years by venipuncture as shown in Fig. 1A . Samples were collected before first (week 0, W0), and three weeks (W3, right before 2 nd vaccination), five weeks (W5) is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprintThe copyright holder for this this version posted February 15, 2022. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.02.10.22270733 doi: medRxiv preprint streptomycin, and 10% human AB serum (all Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at 5 x 10 6 cells / mL.

Assessment of antigen-specific T cells (ART)

Antigen-reactive T cell responses were analyzed using a protocol based on previous work 1 . 500 µL media containing 5 x 10 6 PBMC were transferred into 12 mL round-bottom tubes (Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Frickenhausen, Germany) and stimulated with either SARS-CoV-2 spike protein peptide mix (wildtype, Miltenyi is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprintThe copyright holder for this this version posted February 15, 2022. ; https://doi.org/10.1101 https://doi.org/10. /2022 permeabilization buffer supplemented with antibodies targeting CD40L ( Antigen-reactive CD4 T cells (ART) were defined as CD40L+ IFN+ expressing cells after spike peptide stimulation, and their frequencies were determined among total CD4 T cells.

T cells from unstimulated control samples were subtracted from ART frequencies for each individual donor. Whenever this difference was equal to or below 0%, frequencies were set to 0.0001%, a value exceeded by all measurements in which ART were detectable, in order to allow the display of data on a logarithmic scale in is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprintThe copyright holder for this this version posted February 15, 2022. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.02.10.22270733 doi: medRxiv preprint a 5 % CO2 atmosphere, and cytopathic effects were evaluated at day 4 post infection. Neutralization was defined as the absence of cytopathic effects in the serum dilutions. The reciprocal neutralization titer was calculated from the highest serum dilution without cytopathic effects as a geometric mean based on three replicates. The lower detection limit of the assay is 8 (reciprocal titer) for week 24 sera and 16 for week 26 sera, corresponding to the first dilution of the respective serum. Two positive controls were used as inter-assay neutralization standards and quality control for each test. Neutralization assays were performed in the BSL-4 laboratory of the Institute of Virology at Philipps University Marburg, Germany..

To determine differences between cohorts in Fig. 1F (vaccinated group W26 vs recovered group), a two-tailed Mann-Whitney test was applied to calculate the P value. For assessing donor-specific responses over time, the two-tailed Wilcoxon matched-pairs signedrank test was used. Slopes reflecting immune contractions were calculated by linear regression from log-transformed data. Data for each donor and each contraction was normalized to 1 for week 5 (first contraction) and week 26 (second contraction).Donors selected to evaluate contractions (slopes) were those who participated also in W40. Slopes were calculated from 14 donors (RBD and spike IgG serum responses) and 12 donors (spike-specific CD4 T cell responses).
