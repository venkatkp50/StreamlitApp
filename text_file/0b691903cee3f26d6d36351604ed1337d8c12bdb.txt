Disease severity depends on viral strain 53 and host risk factors have been identified such as age and male gender. In addition, an excessive 54 immune response has been identified in patients showing a cytokine storm associated with ARDS 1 . 55Various immunosuppressive drugs, including IL-6 blockers or JAK-STAT signaling inhibitors have been 56 suggested for the treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection 2 whereas additional clinical trials are evaluating 57 the use of recombinant interferon to foster host antiviral response. (Clinicaltrials NCT04315948, 58 NCT04293887). Type I interferons (IFN-I) are major components of the innate immune system and 59 represent critical antiviral molecules 3 . To date, IFN-I response has not been evaluated in COVID-19 60 patients and its contribution to the viral control and inflammation is unknown. 61In this study, we assessed the kinetics of plasma IFN-I in COVID-19 patients with a spectrum of 62 severity degree. This study was approved by an ethical committee for biomedical research (Comité 63 de Protection des Personnes HCL). (Supplemental material and method of this article Online 64 Repository). 65Firstly, we explored three patients issued from the first COVID cluster diagnosed in France (Les 66Contamines, Haute Savoie, France) in February 2020. We took advantage of the new digital ELISA 67 technology single-molecule arrays (Simoa) 4 and analyzed the kinetics of plasma inflammatory 68 cytokines. Interleukin (IL)-6, C-reactive protein (CRP) and interferon γ-induced protein 10 (IP-10) 69were elevated in the two symptomatic patients (Pt1, 3) (supplementary Figure 1 in the Online 70 Repository). Strikingly, no IFN-α2 was detectable in these two patients. In contrast, IL-6, CRP and IP-71 elevation of plasmatic IFN-α2 was observed. Viral loads were low with no obvious quantitative 73 difference between all three patients. 74We further explored a larger cohort of 26 critically ill COVID patients from one of the intensive care 75 unit (ICU) at Hospices Civils de Lyon (Lyon, France). Of note, all the patients were treated with 76 standard of care and none received antiviral or immunotherapies. Considering the first 28 days of 77 infection, more than half of critically ill patients required invasive mechanical ventilation (14/26). We 78 observed that patients demonstrated a peak in IFN-α2 at day 8-10 of symptoms onset corresponding 79to the viral replication phase, that decreased overtime to low but still detectable IFN-α2 The timing of interferon exposition may be critical to control the virus and avoid 98 immunopathogenesis. Channappavanar et al. have shown that delayed IFN-I expression can be 99 detrimental in mice in the context of SARS-CoV-1 infection 6 . Our data suggests that screening 100 patients for IFN production is instrumental to select those who could benefit from early intervention 101 with IFN. Following day 10, IL-6 remains increased while IFN-α tapered. This kinetics highlight that 102 cytokine inhibitors could be helpful at the second phase of the disease following IFN-I decrease. Viral 103 characteristic or individual genetic susceptibility should be explored to understand the defect of IFN-104 α production in some COVID patients. Some IFN-α2 positive patients also experienced fatal outcome 105 highlighting the multifactorial causes of disease severity. We acknowledge limitations of this study, 106 related to the small number of included patients and the technical limitation for the measurement of 107 IFN-β and IFN-λ, in this proof of concept study. 108Here, we provide new argues for an early intervention with recombinant IFN-α2 and we also 109 highlight the window of opportunity for immunosuppressors at the second phase of the disease, 110
