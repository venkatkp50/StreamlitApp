RV end-diastolic diameters and mPAP values were significantly increased in patients with cardiac injury, whereas the tricuspid inflow E/A ratio (the ratio of peak velocity blood flow from LV relaxation in early diastole [E wave] to peak velocity flow in late diastole caused by atrial contraction [A wave]) and TAPSE were reduced ( Table 1) . All patients were treated with oxygen, and the percentages of use of noninvasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation were 16.5 % (19 patients) and 9. 5 Values are mean AE SD or n (%).COVID-19 ¼ coronavirus disease-2019; E/A ¼ ratio of peak velocity blood flow from LV relaxation in early diastole [E wave] to peak velocity flow in late diastole caused by atrial contraction [A wave]); LV ¼ left ventricle; MPAP ¼ mean pulmonary artery pressure; NS ¼ not significant; PASP ¼ pulmonary artery systolic pressure; RV ¼ right ventricle; TAPSE ¼ tricuspid annular systolic plane excursion; TRV ¼ tricuspid regurgitation velocity. Our study shows that the presence and extent of CAC are associated with a worse prognosis in is associated with a mortality rate of more than 20%, and even 50% when surgery is indicated and not performed (2, 3) .We compared the number of cases of IE diagnosed in 2 regional tertiary reference centers from Belgium
