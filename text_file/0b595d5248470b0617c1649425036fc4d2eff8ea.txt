Agenda for the Sustainable Development calls for empowering vulnerable groups such as internal migrants to reduce inequalities. 4 As of 2019, China's internal migrant population stood at 236 million. Internal migrants is kind of resident status referring who living outside his place of household registration in China. 5 Household registration, or Hukou, was established in 1955 in order to regulate population mobility and to serve as a basis for allocating resources to specific groups. 6 Access to local welfare benefits, including education, job opportunities, housing, especially health care services remains tied to resident status. [7] [8] [9] [10] This inequality has negatively affected the health status of migrants. 11 The World Health Organization declared the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health to be one of the fundamental rights of every human being. 12 Achieving equity in primary care is the most important thing to achieve the equity of health because primary care can meet people' the most basic medical needs, recognized as an approach to realized health for all. 13 14 Many countries have taken measures to strengthen their primary care systems. 15 16 During the covid-19 emergency, primary care services provided by community health centers (CHCs) helped control the spread of the virus and provide comprehensive and continuity care for patients. 17 18 To improve equity in primary care system, China initiated the 'Equal Access to Public Health Services among Migrants' policy in 2013, which proposed measures to provide primary care services that meet migrants needs. 19 Moreover, the Healthy China 2030 policy calls for Patient' experiences, clinical effectiveness, and patient safety are the three pillars of quality in medical services. 20 But, the quality of primary care services is usually reflected in patient's primary care experiences. To evaluate this, the Primary Care Assessment Tool (PCAT) was developed by John Hopkins Primary Care Policy Center. It has been applied in many countries and has good reliability and validity in China. [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] Prior research has either focused on migrants' health status, needs, and utilization of primary care services in some countries, particularly in Europe, or assessed migrants' primary care experiences and explored related influencing factors. [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] However, the studies comparing the differences of primary care experiences between migrants and residents are so few that it is difficult to determine if there are differences in the quality of primary care received by migrants and residents. One study conducted in Guangzhou has indicated that migrants' and residents' primary care experiences, as assessed by PCAT, seems equal. 24 But, a Shenzhen study used self-made questionnaires to assess the quality of the primary care and found the care to migrants is less satisfactory than that to residents in terms of the attitudes of health workers and waiting times. 33 Our previous studies in the Greater Bay Area have found an association of patients' experiences with usual source of care, types of health care facilities and the institutional primary care services quality. 21 25 Thus, based on our previous findings, we generated hypothesis that resident status may affect the experiences of patients with CHC as usual source of care. We evaluated the primary care experiences of migrants and residents in Guangzhou, the core city of the Greater Bay Area, using the well-established and reliable PCAT and 

Design and participants

We conducted a cross-sectional survey of adult patients at 6 CHCs in Guangzhou, China, using multi-stage cluster random sampling from September to November 2019. Firstly, we selected all the 4 center-urban districts: Liwan, Yuexiu, Tianhe, and Haizhu, and randomly selected 2 communities from Tianhe and Haizhu districts and 1 community from Yuexiu and Liwan districts. Then, 1 family doctor team was randomly selected to help us to recruit patients.Finally, patients completed the questionnaires on paper or online with the help of trained professional investigators. Those patients were older than 20 years and visited a CHC at least once before the survey were enrolled. Patients were excluded if they had severe mental health disorders, or could not understand the questionnaire. Prior to every survey attempt, each patient signed an informed consent form.

Measures

Patient's primary care experiences were measured by the primary care assessment tool (PCAT).A series scales of PCAT were developed by the Primary Care Policy Center of Johns Hopkins University, measuring the extent and quality of primary care services in provider settings. 34 We Note: P-value is based on Chi-square test. Table 2 showed the mean value ± standard deviation and median (interquartile range) of migrants and residents' PCAT scores, respectively. Among all domains, the score of First Contact-Access domain was the lowest with a mean (±SD) of 2.97 (±0.74) and a median of 3.00 (range 2.50-3.75). The difference of the total PCAT score between migrants and residents was statistically significant (Mann-Whitney test, P＜0.001) , as well as scores in all domains.

Patients' Experiences

As shown in Figure 1 , migrants scored lower than residents across all domains on the median indicators. The mean of migrants' scores were also completely surrounded by that of residents in all domains. See Appendix 1 for details. Table 3 demonstrates the association between resident status and PCAT score after adjusting for confounding variables. For total PCAT score, migrants had on average an estimated 0.128 points lower score than residents (95%CI, -0.218 to -0.037). Additionally, migrants scored significantly lower than residents in 

Discussion

In this study, we explored the differences in primary care experiences between migrants and residents. Migrants' primary care experiences scores were significantly lower than residents' in total and in the following domains: First contact-utilization, Ongoing care, Community orientation, Family-centeredness, and Cultural competence.These findings that migrants had worse experiences are congruent with some studies. 41But, another research has demonstrated that migrants are equal to residents in terms of overall experiences of primary care. 24 The inconsistency may be resulted from the differences between studies in their inclusion and exclusion criteria for patients and the sample size. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   17   migrants move to a community, their previous CHCs should share their medical histories and other information with their now local CHCs.In this study, the difference between migrants and residents in term of the Cultural competence domain was significant. Culture are important barriers to accessing healthcare services not only for internal migrants but also international migrants, which has long been studied and discussed by scholars. 49 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   18 migrants is often poor, which will affect their community health services experiences. 54

Conclusion

In conclusion, this study has indicated that migrants' primary care experiences are worse off than those of residents in China. We still have a long way to achieve the goal of equitable and accessible primary care services for all in Healthy China 2030. To close the gap, policymakers should accelerate reform of the household registration system, deepen reform of the health care system and focus on improving migrants' primary care experiences, especially in terms of utilization, continuity and cultural competence. Importantly, policies should be made to mitigate the impacts of cultural differences and language barriers on migrants seeking medical services.Furthermore, the findings are also useful to America, Australia, Europe and other countries that accommodate many migrants with different cultures to improve the primary care experiences of migrants. Promoting the equality between migrants and residents in China will be significative for achieving the goal of health for all and improving global equity.

Results: 1568 questionnaires were analyzed. After adjusting for age, sex, education, annual 17 family income, self-perceived health status, chronic condition, annual medical expenditure 18 and medical insurance, the PCAT total scores of the migrants were significantly lower than 19 those of local residents Strengths and limitations of this study: 10  This study adopted an internationally established scale, PCAT, which has been 11 recognized and used by many countries.

 The assessment of primary care experiences plays an important role in improving 13 primary care services because it helps family doctors and CHCs to better understand 14 patients' primary health experiences and needs, and improve the quality of primary care 15 services. 16  Some potential confounding factors influencing the association of resident status and 17 patients' primary care experiences might have been neglected, such as the duration of 18 residence. 19  This study was conducted in Guangzhou and may have resulted in selection bias and lack 20 of generalizability. Further studies should be carried out in more areas across China. More than 247 million people migrated from one country to another in 2013, and over 750 3 million migrated within countries that same year. 1 Migrants are more likely to get infectious 4 and non-infectious diseases due to their living and working conditions. 2 3 The United Nations 5 2030 Agenda for the Sustainable Development calls for empowering vulnerable groups such 6 as internal migrants to reduce inequalities. 4 7The World Health Organization has declared that the achievement of the highest 8 attainable standard of health should become one of the fundamental rights of every human 9 being. 5 Achieving equity in primary care is the most important thing to assure equity in health 10 because primary care can meet people' most basic medical needs and is widely recognized as 11 an approach to realizing health for all. 6 7 Many countries have taken measures to strengthen 12 their primary care systems. 8 9 During the Covid-19 emergency, primary care services 13 provided by community health centers (CHCs) have an important role in controlling the 14 spread of the virus and providing comprehensive and continuity care for patients. 10 11 15 As of 2019, China's internal migrant population stood at 236 million.

[14] [15] [16] [17] Earlier studies have shown that at the beginning of the 21st century, migrants suffered 2 from inadequate allocation of health resources in terms of access to public health services in 3 China. 19 20 Primary care services were unlikely to cover migrants of lower socio-economic 4 status and across provincial boundaries. In January 2009, the Chinese government issued the 5 Opinions on Deepening the Reform of the Health System and launched a new round of health 6 system reform. However, despite this effort, the migrants still made less use of community 7 health services. 21 8 To address this issue and promote health equity in primary care system, China initiated 9 the 'Equal Access to Public Health Services among Migrants' policy in 2013, which 10 proposed measures to provide primary care services to meet migrants' needs. 22 Moreover, the 11 Healthy China 2030 initiative has called for promoting the equalization of primary care 12 services, especially between migrants and local residents. 13 Patients' experiences, clinical effectiveness, and patient safety are the three pillars of 14 quality in medical services. 23 But, the quality of primary care services is usually reflected in 15 patients' primary care experiences.

Design and participants 3 We conducted a cross-sectional survey of adult patients at six CHCs in Guangzhou, 4 China, using multi-stage cluster random sampling from September to November 2019. First, 5 we selected all the four center-urban districts: Liwan, Yuexiu, Tianhe, and Haizhu, and provider settings. 40 We used an unmodified Chinese language version of the original 18 simplified PCAT scale which had a reliability coefficient of 0.963, with an acceptable 19 test-retest reliability coefficient of 0.7 (accepted for publication elsewhere). The PCAT 20 included the following ten domains: First contact-utilization, First contact-access, Ongoing In our study, hukou status was considered a key independent variable, defined as local 11 residents (hukou registered in Guangzhou) or migrants (hukou registered in areas other than 12 Guangzhou). Moreover, we collected individual information including socio-demographic 13 and health-related characteristics with a self-administered questionnaire. Socio-demographic 14 information consisted of age (years), sex (male vs. female), annual average household income 15 (￥) and education level (Uneducated, Primary school, Middle school, High school, College 16 or above). Health-related characteristics included self-perceived health status (good, average 17 or bad), chronic condition (yes vs. no), diabetes condition (yes vs. no), hypertension 18 condition (yes vs. no), type of health insurance (medical insurance for urban and rural 19 residents, medical insurance for employee, business insurance and so on) and annual medical 20 expenditure (￥). The quantitative variables were expressed as means ± standard deviations and median 3 (interquartile range), and the categorical variables were expressed as absolute numbers and 4 percentages. A generalized linear model was used to evaluate the association between 5 resident status and patients' primary care experiences. A 95% confidence interval was used. 6 The dependent variables used in the model were PCAT score, First contact-utilization score, 7 First contact-access score, Ongoing care score, Coordination (referral) score, Coordination 8 (information) score, Comprehensiveness (services available) score, Comprehensiveness 9 (services provided) score, Family-centeredness score, Community orientation score and 10 Cultural competence score. The independent covariates included were: age, sex, education, 11 annual household income, self-perceived health status, chronic condition, annual medical 12 expenditure, and medical insurance. 27 29 41- 46 No covariate was included in the crude models. 13 Two-side P<0.05 was considered significant. All statistical analyses were performed using 14 IBM SPSS25.0. 15 Patients and public involvement 16 Patients or the public were not involved in the design, conduct, reporting, or dissemination 17 plans of our research. 18 Design and participants 3 We conducted a cross-sectional survey of adult patients at six CHCs in Guangzhou, 4 China, using multi-stage cluster random sampling from September to November 2019.

Baseline Characteristics of Patients 20 1776 PCAT questionnaires were sent out and 1744 were collected, with a response rate of cleaning, 1568 questionnaires were valid with an effective rate of 89.9%. As shown in Table   3 1, most (62.8%) of patients were 60 years or older and 55.8% were female. 11.9% of patients 4 were migrants and 88.1% were local residents. Compared with local residents, lower 5 proportions of migrants were aged 60 or over ( Table 2 shows the mean value ± standard deviation and median (interquartile range) of the 5 PCAT scores of migrants and local residents, respectively. Among all domains, the score of 6 First Contact-Access domain was the lowest with a mean (±SD) of 2.97 (±0.74) and a median 7 of 3.00 (range 2.50-3.75). The difference of the total PCAT score between migrants and local 8 residents was statistically significant (Mann-Whitney test, P＜0.001) , as well as scores in all 9 domains. As shown in Figure 1 , migrants scored lower than local residents across all domains 10 on the median indicators. See Appendix 1 for details. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 In this study, we explored the differences in primary care experiences between migrants and 9 local residents. Migrants' primary care experiences scores were significantly lower than local 10 residents' in total and in the following domains: First contact-utilization, Ongoing care, 11 Community orientation, Family-centeredness, and Cultural competence after adjusting for 12 patient sociodemographic characteristics. 13 The finding that migrants had worse primary care experiences is congruent with some 14 published studies elsewhere. 47 But, another research demonstrated that migrants were equal 15 to local residents in terms of overall experiences of primary care. 30 The inconsistency could 16 have resulted from differences between studies in their inclusion and exclusion criteria for 17 patients and the sample size. Shenzhen's 611 CHCs for initial care. Establishing a medical insurance system for migrants 8 that encourages them to use CHCs as their first-contact institution and improving the medical 9 services of those CHCs could be an effective policy option. 10 Family doctors should also embrace the concept of taking care of migrants. Although the 11 difference in First contact-access domain scores between migrants and local residents was not 12 statistically significant, it's worth noting that this was the lowest score for both groups. A 13 previous study showed that, compared with local residents, fewer migrants were entitled to 14 with current CHCs. 6 In this study, the difference between migrants and local residents in terms of Cultural 7 competence domain was significant. Cultural differences are important barriers to accessing 8 healthcare services not only for internal migrants but also for international migrants, which 9 has long been studied and discussed by scholars. 55 56 Barriers to effective and equitable 10 healthcare can result from linguistic differences between patients and doctors. 57 It is crucial to 11 accurately convey risk factors of disease when communicating the details of a diagnosis or 12 treatment. 58 Hence, family doctors in Guangzhou should learn to speak in Mandarin, the 13 national dialect, rather than rely on Cantonese, a local dialect. But dialect is just one aspect of 14 culture, and the other aspects of culture, religion for example, may also influence migrants' 15 primary care experiences. Further study should be conducted. 16 In addition, the migrants' primary care experiences were significantly worse off than 17 local residents in the Family-centered care and Community-orientation domains. A large 18 number of studies have shown that Family-centered care was an important way of meeting 19 the needs of family members. 59 Community-oriented care takes into account the healthcare 20 needs of not only the patients and their families but also local residents in the community. 21 The likely reason for migrants' worse experiences in the Community-oriented care domain 22 might be due to work overload by family doctors which was a major barrier to regularly showed that the social integration of migrants was often poor, which could affect their 4 community health services experiences. 60 5 Therefore, to close the gap between migrants and local residents, policymakers should 6 accelerate reform of the household registration system, deepen reform of the healthcare 7 system and focus on improving migrants' primary care experiences, especially in terms of 8 utilization, continuity and cultural competence. Importantly, policies should be made to 9 mitigate the impacts of cultural differences and language barriers on migrants seeking 10 medical services. 11 By examining the association between resident status and patients' primary care 12 experiences in urban area using an internationally established PCAT scale, this study was 13 significant for health promotion in vulnerable groups. However, there were still a number of 14 limitations with our study. The study did not capture all potentially significant confounding 15 factors influencing the association of resident status and patients' primary care experiences. 16 An example was the type and duration of residence. A local resident born in local and a local 17 resident not born in local could have different experiences of primary care. Similarly, the 18 duration of local residence might also matter. A migrant with lengthy local residence might 19 have better assimilated into local culture than migrants with short local residence. Although 20 we tried to minimize the bias by adjusting the sociodemographic and health characteristics, 21 our study still showed a significant relationship between resident status and patients' 22 experiences in cultural competence. Another limitation of the study was its lack of In conclusion, this study indicated that migrants' primary care experiences were worse 5 off than those of local residents in Guangzhou, China, providing evidence for further study 6 about quality of primary care at a national level. There is still a long way to go to achieve the 7 goal of equitable and accessible primary care services for all in Healthy China 2030. 8 Furthermore, the findings could also be relevant to America, Australia, Europe and other 9 countries that accommodate many migrants with different cultures. Promoting the equality 10 between migrants and local residents in China is significant for achieving the goal of health 11 for all and improving global equity.
