of the BTC, the particles from both classes were combined and locally refined 159 inside a mask applied around the holo-RdRp and RNA (excluding the nsp13 160 subunits), leading to the BTC5(local) combined map (3.2 Å; Fig. 1C ; SI Appendix, 161 Fig. S2 and S3, Table S1 ). 162The cryo-EM maps ( Fig. 1C and 2) revealed two significant differences with 163 the nsp13-RTC structures (14): 1) The single-stranded downstream template-164 RNA (t-RNA) engaged with nsp13.1 was resolved ( Fig. 2A) , and 2) a single-165 In the nsp13-RTCs, the RTC-scaffold (Fig. 1A) is bound in a post-200 translocated state (14); the 3' p-RNA A is base-paired to the t-RNA U at the -1 201 site near the catalytic nsp12-D760 (Fig. 5A) .

By contrast, the BTC 204 structures were translocated by one base pair compared to the RTCs; the base 205 pair corresponding to the A-U Watson-Crick base pair at the 3'-end of the p-RNA 206 (located in the -1 site of the RTCs) was in the -2 position of the BTCs (Fig. 1A, 4,  207 and 5B). The -1 position of the BTC was occupied by the first C-A mismatch; the 208 p-RNA -1C made a non-Watson-Crick hydrogen bond with the opposing t-RNA A 209 ( Fig. 4 and 5B) .

Discussion 273

Our results establish that the SARS-CoV-2 RTC backtracks, that backtracking is 274 facilitated by the nsp13 helicase, and that the resulting single-stranded 3'-275 segment of the p-RNA extrudes out the RdRp NTP-entry tunnel in a manner 276 analogous to the evolutionarily unrelated cellular DdRps (Fig. 3) . Thus, a 277 secondary tunnel to accommodate backtracked RNA, facilitating fidelity and 278 possibly other functions (Fig. 6) , appears to be a crucial feature of transcriptase 279 enzymes that evolved independently. 280Backtracking of 6 and poliovirus RdRps has been reported based on 281 analysis of single-molecule observations (41-43). The nsp13 helicase facilitates 282 efficient backtracking of the SARS-CoV-2 RTC (SI Appendix; Fig. S5 ). We note 283 that in bacteria, the UvrD helicase has been shown to induce DdRp backtracking, 284suggesting that a role for helicases in backtracking may be widespread (44). 285Our results are consistent with the view that a matched nucleotide at the pre-286 nucleotide at the p-RNA 3'-end spends more than half the time frayed from the t-293RNA and towards or in the NTP-entry tunnel (Fig. 5C ), a configuration that is 294 likely recalcitrant to translocation and subsequent elongation.
