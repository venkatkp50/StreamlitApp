INTRODUCTION 48

A number of commercially available rapid antigen detection tests (RADT) targeting the 49 SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) have been shown to display a sensitivity of 50 over 80% compared to RT-PCR assays for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 51 symptomatic individuals, provided that testing is conducted within one week after 52 symptoms onset [1] . These RADT were optimized for detection of the ancestral Wuhan-53Hu-1 variant, and the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants which incorporate non-54 synonymous mutations within the amino acid sequence of NP may impact on the 55 diagnostic efficiency of RADT. In this context, two studies [2, 3] showed that the 56 Panbio™ COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device (Abbott Diagnostic GmbH, Jena, Germany) 57 had decreased sensitivity for detection of SARS-CoV-2 Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant 58 compared to non-alpha lineages. As in many other countries, the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron 59 variant has overtaken the Delta variant and currently dominates in Spain

We collected two NPs per patient, one of which (provided by the manufacturer) was 80 used for RADT while the other was placed in 3 mL of universal transport medium 81 is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

As expected, median viral RNA load was significantly higher (P<0.0001) in RT-121 PCR+/RADT+ specimens than in those returning RT-PCR+/RADT-results (Fig. 1) . 122The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted February 2, 2022. .

DISCUSSION 123

The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant carries one or more mutations in the NP gene 124 Omicron and other variants of concern was not possible due to the absolute dominance 158 of the former at the time of study. Third, no cell cultures were performed for specimens 159 returning discordant RT-PCR/RADT results. Fourth, the small number of children, 160 SARS-CoV-2-experienced and unvaccinated individuals enrolled precluded conducting 161 robust subanalyses for these population groups. 162In summary, we found the Panbio™ COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device to perform well 163 as a point-of-care test for early diagnosis of COVID-19 due to the Omicron variant in 164 .
