Yes -all data are fully available without restriction antecedents of vaccination: Confidence (i.e., trust in the effectiveness and safety of vaccines and 66 in the system that delivers them), Complacency (i.e., perceived risk of diseases and perceived 67 level of threat), Constraints (i.e., structural psychological and physical barriers), Calculation (i.e., 68individuals' engagement in extensive information searching) and Collective responsibility (i.e., 69 willingness to protect others) [18] . A scale assessing these five drivers explains more variance in 70 vaccination behavior compared to previous measures that have focused almost solely on 71Confidence. However, the literature shows that the pattern of the most important Cs within the 72 5C model varies across vaccines, target groups and countries [18] . 73Regarding COVID-19 vaccination, studies have shown that women, younger adults, 74 unemployed individuals and those with a lower socioeconomic status are less likely to get 75 vaccinated [11, 19, 20] . Moreover, psychological profiles play a role: vaccine-hesitant and 76 vaccine-resistant individuals are less altruistic, conscientious, more disagreeable, emotionally 77 unstable, and self-interested than are vaccine-acceptant individuals [11] . Finally, higher COVID-78 19 vaccination intention is associated with more positive general and COVID-19 vaccination 79 beliefs, as well as higher perceived vaccine efficacy and safety [20] [21] [22] . 80The importance of studying psychological variables to understand vaccination intention and 81 inform effective interventions has been advocated [14] . A deeper understanding of the underlying 82 psychology of vaccine-resistant and vaccine-hesitant groups can enhance the potential 83 effectiveness of the public health messages targeting these groups. In this study, we aim to 84 increase the understanding of COVID-19 vaccination by studying the 5C model and its 85 psychological drivers. Since younger people are less likely to suffer from the negative health 86 consequences of , it is important to know what the main drivers of 87 getting vaccinated are for these individuals. Based on a sample of university students from the 88 Netherlands, Belgium, and Portugal, we pursue the following four objectives. 89First, we assess the intention to get vaccinated in our international student sample by using a 90 seven-point scale, ranging from completely resistant to completely acceptant. 91Second, as shown in previous research, the antecedents of vaccine hesitancy differ across 92 vaccines, target groups and countries [18] . We are the first to study which Cs-Confidence, 93Complacency, Calculation, Constraints, Collective Responsibility (5C's)are most important for 94 COVID-19 vaccination intention in a sample of young adults. 95 Third, as stressed by the authors of the 5C model, knowing the relative importance of the Cs 96 is just a first step, which should be followed by further exploration of the potential levers of these 97 drivers [18] . Using mediation analyses, we investigate which psychological variables, including 98 COVID-19 vaccine-related and COVID-19-related attitudes and personality traits, affect 99 vaccination intention through the 5Cs. This will improve our understanding of vaccination 100 antecedents and, consequently, for which groups reaching desirable levels of these 5Cs and, 101 thereby, vaccination intention may be problematic. The mediation analyses we performed are 102 summarized in Fig 1. Previous studies have shed light on several bivariate relationships between 103 the 5Cs and psychological constructs [18] (presented by the orange arrows in Fig 1) . We study 104 whether these constructs indeed affect vaccination intention through the suggested C. 105Additionally, we study the new indirect relationships represented by the blue arrows in 121 122

The data used in this study are part of the Erasmus University Rotterdam International 125 COVID-19 Student Survey (EURICSS). This is a longitudinal study on COVID-19-related 126 behaviors and attitudes among university students from multiple countries [24] . Thus far, data 127 have been collected at two points in time. For both studies, approval was obtained by the Internal 128Review Board of the Erasmus University Rotterdam. All students signed an informed consent 129 form before starting the survey. 130During the early days of the pandemic (weeks 17-19, 2020, T1), data were collected for the 131 first time. Students were approached through university student systems and invitations sent to 132 university e-mail addresses. In total, data from 7,400 university students in ten countries 133 worldwide were collected. 134Data collection for T2 took place between weeks 51 and 52, 2020. Only students who 135 participated at T1 and studied in the Netherlands, Belgium and Portugal were approached. Other 136 country samples were not reapproached since the number of students who agreed to be contacted 137 for follow-up was insufficient to assure large enough samples at T2. Students were contacted 138 through invitations that were sent to the e-mail addresses they provided at T1. Two reminders 139 were sent to those students who did not yet finish or start the survey three and seven days after 140 the first invitation. In total, data were collected from 1,137 students, for a response rate of 39.2%. 141At both T1 and T2, surveys were shared using the online survey software Qualtrics. At T1, 142 the survey contained questions on COVID-19-related attitudes, compliance with COVID-19 143 regulations, and several personality traits. For this study, only the T1 data on personality traits are 144 used. As personality traits are relatively stable over time [25] , we suppose that this is not a 145 problem for the validity of our outcomes. If anything, using multiple measurement times 146 decreases the probability of common method bias [26] . At T2, the survey contained similar 147 questions on COVID-19-related attitudes and compliance with regulations. In addition, questions 148 on COVID-19 vaccination intention and vaccination attitudes were posed. Finally, several 149 personality traits were assessed. The surveys could be completed in English, Dutch or French. 150Since we mainly use data collected during T2, the dataset for this study contains the 1,137 151 students who participated both at T1 and T2 and were studying in one of the three countries 152 mentioned (the Netherlands N=195; Belgium=745; Portugal N=294). On average, students were 153 22.92 years old, and 59.3% of the sample was female. 154

The operationalization of all variables is explained in this section. The means, standard 156 deviations of all variables and correlations of all variables with vaccination intention and the 5C 157 scale are presented in Supporting Information S1 Table. 158

Participants were asked the following question: 'If a coronavirus vaccine that was approved 160 safe and effective was available to you free at cost, would you get vaccinated?' Answers could be 161given on a seven-point scale: 'definitely not' (1), 'very probably not' (2), 'probably not' (3), 162 'unsure -neutral' (4), 'probably yes' (5), 'very probably yes' (6) and 'definitely yes' (7). A 163 higher score thus indicates a higher intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19. The 164 continuous scale is used instead of grouping students as being acceptant, hesitant, or resistant. 165This approach offers a more accurate understanding of vaccination intention, as grouping all 166 students who indicate somewhere between 'probably will not' and 'probably will' under hesitant 167 conditions will lower the unique variation that can be exploited. 168 

Perceived risk of the COVID-19 vaccine

182 Bipolar questions were used to assess the perceived risk of the COVID-19 vaccine. Students 183 were asked the following: 'To what extent do you think the following characteristics apply to 184 COVID-19 vaccines?' Answers could be given on a seven-point scale using bipolar adjectives, 185 which is common practice when assessing attitude [28] . An average score was taken for the 186 following three characteristics: safety ('very unsafe' (1) to 'very safe' (7)), likeliness of side 187 effects ('side effects are very likely' (1) to 'side effects are very unlikely' (7)) and riskiness 188 ('very risky' (1) to 'not risky at all' (7)). The score on safety was reversed before analysis, such 189 that a higher score indicates a higher perceived risk of the vaccine. Internal consistency is very 190 good (α=.85). 191

192

A similar question was used to assess the perceived effectiveness of the Students were asked the following: 'To what extent do you think the following characteristics 194 apply to COVID-19 vaccines?' Answers could be given on a seven-point scale, ranging from 195 'very ineffective' (1) to 'very effective' (7). 196 197 Normative beliefs about the COVID-19 vaccine (T2) 198 The descriptive social norms in students' social environment regarding getting vaccinated 199 against COVID-19 was assessed using two questions, distinguishing between the norm among 200 family and that among friends. 

207

A question was asked on the perceived personal versus social benefits of COVID-19 208 vaccination using a bipolar seven-point scale. We asked students to complete a statement-209 'Getting vaccinated against the coronavirus will mainly benefit:', with answer options ranging 210 from 'myself' (1) to '(vulnerable) others around me' (7). 211

212

Three questions were asked about the risk of COVID-19 for the students themselves. These 213 questions asked about the perceived likelihood of getting infected with COVID-19, getting 214 severely ill if infected and being hospitalized if infected. The same three questions were asked 215 about the risk of COVID-19 for the friends and family of the student. Average values of the three 216 items were taken to create a general COVID-19 risk score for oneself and for others. Internal 217 consistency is acceptable (COVID-19 risk: self α=.67; others α=.71). 218

219

Students were asked whether they had been infected with the coronavirus before (1=yes, 220 either confirmed by a test or only expected; 0: no or have not been aware of it). 221 222 General risk attitude (T2) 223 General risk attitudes were assessed by using the risk propensity scale (RPS) [29] , which 224 consists of seven items. All statements were rated in terms of agreement on a nine-point Likert 225 scale, ranging from 'totally disagree' (1) to 'totally agree' (9), except for the final item, which 226 was rated on a scale ranging from 'risk avoider' (1) to 'risk seeker' (9). Higher scores indicate a 227 higher risk-seeking tendency. Internal consistency was good, at α=.77. A French translation was 228 previously presented based on a back translation approach [30] . The scale was translated to Dutch 229 by two native speakers who first translated the scale individually, after which a consensus 230 meeting took place to discuss and decide on inconsistencies. 231

Delay discounting (T1)

232 Delay discounting is a behavioral measure related to impulsivity and reflects the degree to 233 which people are able to delay rewards, i.e., a measure of impatience. Delay discounting was 234 assessed by the discount rate, with a higher rate reflecting a faster devaluation of delayed rewards 235 and thus greater impulsivity. To capture the discount rate in a fast and accurate manner, the 5-236 trail Adjusting Delay Discounting Task was used, in which students had to make five consecutive 237 hypothetical choices between receiving €1,000 after a specific delay and receiving €500 238 directly [31] . The task starts with a delay of 3 weeks, which is increased or decreased based on 239 previous choices. The discount rate is calculated using the hyperbolic discounting model [32] and 240 is log-transformed before analysis, as is commonly done in previous research [31, 33] . 241

242

The Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-Brief (BIS-Brief), which is a short unidimensional version 243 of the BIS-11, was used to assess the personality construct of impulsivity [34, 35] . It consists of 8 244 items scored on a four-point scale, ranging from 'rarely/never' (1) to 'almost always/always' (4). 245Half of the items were reverse scored. Validated French and Dutch translations were used 246 [36, 37] . The reliability was good, at α=.75. 247

248

Using the Life-Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R), dispositional optimism was measured 249[38]. Both Dutch and French translations were already available [39, 40] . The LOT-R consists of 250 10 items, of which four are filler items. Answers are given on a five-point scale, ranging from 251 'strongly disagree' (1) to 'strongly agree' (5). Higher scores indicate a higher level of 252 dispositional optimism. Internal consistency was good, as reflected by Cronbach's alpha (α=.81). 253

Self-efficacy (T1)

254 General self-efficacy was measured using the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES), which 255 was designed to predict individuals' coping with daily hassles and adaptation after stressful showing high test-retest reliability and validity [46, 49] . There has been a debate on the relevance 274 of alpha values in evaluating brief personality constructs in such cases [50, 51] . International student (T1) 291 We inferred that students who answered 'no' to the question 'Have you lived in [name 292 country] for more than 5 years?' were international students, which was coded with a value of 1. 293

294

Gender was included as a dummy variable, with female (1) and male (0) as answer options. 295

296

The analyses used are linked to the first three objectives of the study. For the first objective, 297 the percentage of students who indicated a certain degree of willingness to get vaccinated against 298 COVID-19 were calculated. For the second objective, one-sided ordinary least squares (OLS) 299 regression analyses were conducted with the 5C subscales as independent variables, vaccination 300 intention as a dependent variable, and country and gender as control variables. We controlled for 301 country differences by including country dummies, and Dutch students were used as a reference 302 group. The standardized coefficients of the regression analysis were used to assess the effect sizes 303 of all Cs to conclude which of these components is most important in explaining COVID-19 304 vaccination intention among students. Finally, for the third objective, mediation analyses were 305 conducted using the PROCESS macro in SPSS [54] . The models were estimated for all predictors 306 of a particular C at the same time; consequently, the direct and indirect effects were estimated 307 while controlling for the other predictors of the C. All resulting paths were therefore as if they 308 have been estimated simultaneously using simultaneous equation modeling [54] . Three regression 309 models were estimated. Model 1 includes the independent variables and controls, with 310 vaccination intention as the dependent variable. This model presents the total effect for the 311 independent variables (c, see Fig 2) . Model 2 includes all independent variables and controls, 312 with the mediator as the dependent variable. This model includes path 'a' (Fig 2) . Finally, Model 313 3 includes-next to the independent variables and controls-the mediator as a predictor, with 314 vaccination intention as the dependent variable. This model contains the direct effect (c' , Fig 2) 315 and path b (Fig 2) . To estimate the indirect effect, bias-corrected bootstrapping was used to 316 generate a 95% confidence interval (CI). Bias-corrected bootstrapping is now considered the 317 standard for testing mediation [55, 56] . A common seed was used so that at each run, the 318 bootstrap confidence intervals were based on the same set of 10,000 resamples from the data 319 (85.49%) indicated that they intended to get vaccinated within a range between 'probably' and 334 'definitely', only 40.9% of the students were totally convinced to get vaccinated ('definitely 335 yes'). Only a very small group was totally resistant to COVID-19 vaccination (1.58%) and 336 indicated that they will 'definitely not' get vaccinated. Almost 1 out of 10 students (9.41%) 337 indicated a negative propensity toward COVID-19 vaccination, as they answered within a range 338 between 'probably not' and 'definitely not'. A total of 5. presented in the tables, using the example of the perceived safety of the vaccine as an 366 independent variable and Confidence as a mediator. In Fig 4, we do not show the covariates. 367As presented above, Confidence is an important positive driver of COVID-19 vaccination 368 intention among students. The results of the mediation analyses in Table 2 show that the 369 perceived risk of the COVID-19 vaccine is most strongly associated with vaccination intention 370 through Confidence (ab=-.17; 95% bias-corrected confidence interval (95% BC-CI) = [-.22, -371 .13]), of which all corresponding relationships are visually presented in Fig 4. .34 .14 .35Note: The indirect effects that are bold printed do not contain zero in their 95% bias-corrected confidence intervals 402 (95% BC-CI) and are interpreted as being statistically significant. β is a standardized coefficient. The indirect effect 403 is completely standardized for continuous variables and partially standardized for binary variables.

405

Analyses with Complacency as a mediator are presented in Table 4 Table 5 shows the mediation analyses with Constraints as a mediator. We only find a small 425 significant indirect effect of self-efficacy (ab=.03, 95% BC-CI = [.003, .07]). Students with a 426 higher level of self-reported self-efficacy perceive fewer constraints, which is related to higher 427 vaccination intention. However, a significant direct effect of self-efficacy on vaccination 428 intention remains after controlling for Constraints (β=-.09, p<.01). Optimism, impulsivity and 429 being an international student do not indirectly relate to vaccination intention through Calculation 430 as the confidence intervals corresponding to these variables contain zero. 431 

453

According to the results, the majority of the 1,137 Dutch, Belgian and Portuguese students 454 do not have a full and definite intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19. More than half of 455 them (57.7%) fall on a continuum between leaning toward acceptance and leaning toward 456 resistance. Although a large majority of our sample has a positive propensity toward getting 457 vaccinated against COVID-19 (85% of students indicate intentions between 'probably' and 458 'definitely'), the group of students who are completely acceptant of the vaccine (41%) is quite 459 small. At the same time, only a very small group indicates to refuse a vaccination (1.6%). To 460 achieve herd immunity through vaccination, it is crucial that more students shift their intention 461 toward a more positive definite answer. Most gains can be achieved by targeting students who 462 already have a positive propensity toward vaccination but are not completely certain. As previous 463 studies mostly use yes/no scales to assess vaccination intention, it is not possible to directly 464 compare our results to those of previous studies. For example, using a yes/no format, 95% of 465 respondents indicate a willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in a sample of students in 466Italy [59] . 467 468 We show that all five components of the 5C model-Confidence, Calculation, Complacency, 469

5C drivers of students' COVID-19 vaccination intention

Constraints and Collective Responsibility-are related to COVID-19 vaccination among 470 students. Confidence, i.e., the degree of trust in the vaccine and the system that delivers it, and 471Collective Responsibility, i.e., the willingness to protect others by getting vaccinated, are the 472 strongest predictors of COVID-19 vaccination intention. This suggests that campaigns targeted at 473 increasing vaccination intention among young adults will likely be most successful when focused 474 on enhancing the levels of both Confidence and Collective Responsibility. Smaller negative links 475 are present between vaccination intention and Complacency, Constraints, and Calculation. 476 Psychological profiles underlying COVID-19 vaccination intention 477 We show that psychological profiles indeed play an important role in explaining vaccination 478 intention. As vaccination campaigns will most likely be most successful when targeted at 479Confidence and Collective Responsibility, we discuss which psychological variables underlie 480 these drivers and should therefore be considered when designing interventions. 481First, we show that the perceived risk and effectiveness of the vaccine both affect vaccination 482 intention through changes in Confidence levels. The level of Confidence will likely be lower for 483 students who perceive the vaccine as being riskier (e.g., less safe and with a higher risk of side 484 effects) and less effective. Moreover, trust in the government and health authorities plays an 485 important role in explaining vaccination intention through Confidence. Students with lower trust 486 in these institutions report lower levels of Confidence, which translates into lower vaccination 487 intention. Finally, the descriptive norm in students' environment-the degree to which family 488 and friends intend to get vaccinated-has a small effect on intention through Confidence. 489However, we show that the descriptive norm has a strong direct relationship with vaccination 490 intention. 491With respect to Collective Responsibility, it is evident that the perceived risk of COVID-19 492 for people in a student's social circle indirectly affects his/her vaccination intention through 493Collective Responsibility. Students who perceive the risk of COVID-19 for their environment as 494 being low indicate a lower intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19, motivated by a lower 495 willingness to protect others. Moreover, we show that personality plays an important role in 496 explaining the perception of vaccination as a Collective Responsibility. Traits of psychopathy, 497 which are related to antisocial behavior caused by deficits in empathy, emotion, and self-control 498[44], negatively relate to Collective Responsibility and, therefore, to a lower intention to get 499 vaccinated. Similarly, students with more altruistic personalities, e.g., those who feel more 500 sympathy toward others and want to help those in need, have a higher intention to get vaccinated 501 against COVID-19, caused by higher levels of Collective Responsibility. Additionally, the degree 502 to which students feel the 'need to belong' indirectly relates to higher vaccination intention 503 through Collective Responsibility. The need to belong relates both to the human needs of wanting 504 to affiliate with others and wanting to be accepted by others [60] . We expect that both a need to 505 be in contact with others at risk for COVID-19 without worrying and signaling prosocial 506 behavior to be accepted by others underlie the indirect positive relationship between the need to 507 belong and vaccination intention through Collective Responsibility. 508

Implications for vaccination campaigns and interventions

509 What implications can these results have for public health policy? First, the data suggest that 510 seeking to increase both Confidence and Collective Responsibility simultaneously will be 511 worthwhile since vaccination interventions that address multiple underlying drivers have been 512shown to be more successful [61] . We provide several suggestions for both drivers separately. 513In influencing Confidence, it is important to influence the perceived safety and effectiveness 514 of the COVID-19 vaccine. In our survey, the most prevalent reasons for not getting vaccinated 515were related to worries about safety, side effects, development speed and the wish for the vaccine 516 to be proven effective and safe over a longer period. By challenging the misinformation 517 surrounding the vaccine and providing factual information on, for example, the reasons that the 518 vaccine was able to be developed so fast, Confidence in the vaccine can be increased. However, it 519 is important to think about how and who communicates this information because, for people with 520 a strong prior opinion, a correction of information could backfire and lead to even more divided 521 attitudes [62] . Since we showed that low Confidence is related to lower trust in the government 522 and health authorities, information about safety and efficacy should preferably be communicated 523 by people not within traditional positions of authority. A good strategy would be to use 524 'surprising validators', i.e., people seen as credible to the target audience but who are not 525 expected to share this information [62] . To reach young adults, one could, for example, think of 526 campaigns including peers or celebrities. 527We find Collective Responsibility to be the strongest predictor of COVID-19 vaccination 528 among students. It is logical that this is an important driver for this group since students are less 529 at risk of developing severe health consequences if infected by COVID-19. Willingness to protect 530 others is thus a strong motivator. We show that the perceived risk of COVID-19 for others in a 531 student's social circle indirectly affects his or her vaccination intention through Collective 532Responsibility. Students with at-risk family members will be more likely to get vaccinated to 533 protect those around them. Vaccination campaigns aimed at young adults may thus be more 534 successful by showing the risks for those in the close environment of students. Explaining the 535 concept of herd immunity through vaccination is an important approach, as was also 536 experimentally shown [63] . Students can and should be made aware that they are not just making 537 an individual decision but also a collective decision when deciding whether to get vaccinated. To 538 increase identification, campaigns should seek to explain why certain groups are unable to get 539 vaccinated (e.g., people with allergic reaction to vaccines, pregnant or breastfeeding women, and 540 those aged under 18 years). Nevertheless, our results also indicate that students with less 541 altruistic, emphatic, and social personalities will be less likely to feel Collective Responsibility. 542Influencing these traits is likely to be very difficult, maybe even impossible. As these students 543 feel less empathy toward others, campaigns focused on stressing the prosocial consequences of 544 vaccination may not be sufficient to influence these groups as strongly and could even promote 545 the idea of free riding [64] . Therefore, it remains important to communicate the personal risks of 546 COVID-19 for young adults, for example, by communicating the possibilities of long-lasting 547 adverse consequences of COVID-19, also known as 'long COVID' [65] . 548In addition to positively affecting vaccination intention through Confidence and 549Complacency, we show that the descriptive norm has a strong direct effect on vaccination 550 intention. Descriptive norms have been proven to be strong drivers of behavior, especially in 551 times of uncertainty [66] . Vaccination campaigns could be more successful if they make the norm 552 among students more salient by stressing that the majority of students intend to get vaccinated. 553In most countries, young adults will be the last in line for vaccination. Although this makes 554 sense from a health perspective, governments should realize that by the time students must 555 actively decide whether to get vaccinated, the vaccination strategy may have already led to 556 decreased infection rates and, therefore, also to a lower perceived risk of Importantly, when family members are already vaccinated, the level of Collective Responsibility 558 may decrease through a lower perceived risk of COVID-19 for others. It is therefore vital that 559 campaigns focused on young adults start early on since the necessity of vaccination is now most 560 salient, and therefore, positive intentions can be formulated. Studies show that once a strong 561 enough intention to get vaccinated is formed, this likely translates into action [67] . In terms of 562 policy, to enhance the transition from intention to behavior, the process of getting vaccinated 563 should be easy, fast and without unforeseen barriers [68] . 564Limitations and future research 565 The study has several limitations. First, we measure vaccination intention and not actual 566 vaccination behavior. As the intention-behavior gap shows us that not all intentions translate into 567 behavior [69] , it would be interesting to research whether our results also hold with actual 568 vaccination behavior as the dependent variable. Second, we study a highly educated sample of 569 university students. Although this provides a fairer picture of the drivers of vaccination intention 570 among young adults than studies employing a sample of the general population, the results may 571 not be completely generalizable to all young adults. Although we expect the drivers of 572 vaccination intention to be generalizable across this group, it may be higher in our study, as 573 previous studies have shown higher education to be positively related to COVID-19 vaccination 574 intention [70] . Third, as discussed, vaccination intention is context-and time-dependent. Since 575 we use a snapshot of vaccination intention assessed in December 2020, attitudes and intention 576 toward vaccination may have shifted over time. Finally, for future research, an important next 577 step will be to design and test which interventions have the best outcomes in both experimental 578 and real-life settings. 579Despite its limitations, our study provides governments and public health officials with much 580 needed levers of the important drivers of COVID-19 vaccination intention among students. Given 581 the suggested rate of COVID-19 vaccination acceptance in our sample, we hope that our findings 582 will contribute to the designing and improving of effective public health messaging to increase 583 the acceptance above the percentages needed to achieve herd immunity. 584 585 586
