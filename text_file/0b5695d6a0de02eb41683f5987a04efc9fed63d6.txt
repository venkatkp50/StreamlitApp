impacted have changed from China to European countries, and then the USA over time. 25 Meanwhile, infections and deaths in Brazil, India, and Russia have grown more serious as 26 recently as August. This virus will not disappear and may even resurge over time. It is 27 therefore necessary to prepare for the coming "new normal" (Albani, 2020; Pantuliano, 2020; 28 Park, 2020; Tzannatos, 2020) . 29 According to an expert survey by the World Conference on Transport Research meetings, and party hosts and participants). Therefore, seamless measures to prevent/mitigate 94 infection risks should be made with respect to each stakeholder by reflecting multiple activity 95 and travel behaviors, connections across travel modes, and interactions across stakeholders in 96 a comprehensive manner. 97 In the remaining part of this article, first, a PASS (P: Prepare-Protect-Provide; A: 98 Avoid-Adjust; S: Shift-Share; S: Substitute-Stop) approach is discussed conceptually. 99 Second, policy measures are recommended by referring to past and current best practices. 100 Finally, policymaking challenges and research issues are extensively discussed. Here, a PASS approach is proposed for systematically designing policies that address The present study did not purposely name this approach. Rather, it was initially named 112 after a review of railway transport policy measures for addressing COVID-19 in Japan that 113 revealed a way for it to be generalized. The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and 114 Tourism of Japan (2020) reported taking railway transport policy measures stepwise. The 115 central government requested railway operators to protect employees and users by wearing 116 masks, washing hands, installing antiseptic solution dispensers, and monitoring the body 117 temperature of employees. Next, the government requested railway operators to encourage 118 transit users to choose telework (i.e., avoid trip making) or staggered commuting (i.e., shift 119 departure time for commuting). Further, people were requested to stop making unnecessary or 120 non-urgent trips after a state of emergency was declared nationwide on April 16, 2020. After 121 observing other good practices and thinking in a systematic way, the present author found that 122 the above PASS can be generalized. 123 Regarding transport measures that address COVID-19, TUMI (2020) attempted to 124 arrange them within an existing sustainable urban transport framework: Avoid-Shift-Improve 125 (ASI). However, the PASS approach is more systematic and seamless than the ASI framework. 126 To the author's best knowledge, no other integrated frameworks have been proposed. In 127 principle, the proposal of the PASS approach is in line with general system theory proposed 128 by von Bertalanffy in the 1940s, which states that a system is a complex of interacting 129 elements and the whole is more than the sum of its parts (von Bertalanffy, 2015) . The PASS 130 approach argues that policy measures that address COVID-19 comprise a system composed of 131 four major policy categories, namely, P, A, S, and S, which are not independent of one another 132 in mitigating/preventing the spread of COVID-19. The most important concern is to prepare well for pandemics. Considering that transport Meanwhile, stopping service operation based on an overestimation of infection risks 143 obviously leads to losses in operation revenues and the resulting economic and social losses 144 associated with the lack of transport for essential workers who maintain essential social 145 functions. Thus, the government should take the lead, considering its special role in society. 146 Providing public goods and handling externalities are essential roles of governments (The 147 Library of Economics and Liberty, 2020). COVID-19 and other public health threats are a 148 kind of externality that is caused by various interactions between human beings and the 149 environment. The current pandemic cannot be handled only by the private sector and citizens. 150 Governments should play a key role in fighting it. The same is true for future pandemics. As immediate responses, recovering from the pandemic and rebuilding the society, and 160 optimizing for the new normal (Paydos, 2020) . With preparedness by the government in place, 161 transport operators can prepare well within the governmental framework of preparedness.

162

Preparedness by transport operators can be forced (e.g., stipulated by regulations) or 163 voluntary (e.g., out of a sense of professional obligation or social responsibility).

164

These preparations should be communicated to transport users to encourage or require 165 their preparedness. The above preparedness may further include at least two steps: The most important role for governments is to protect citizens and firms. The second 174 most important role is to provide public goods and services that cannot be provided by 175 individuals or firms (Slaughter, 2020) . Therefore, when a pandemic occurs, governments 176 must first protect both transport users and operators, based on the above preparations. Such 177 protection will allow our society and the economy to run as close to usual as possible, before 178 the pandemic becomes very serious. Even for the current COVID-19 pandemic, people have 179 fallen victim to fake and unreliable information on the virus, its impacts, and the relevant 180 countermeasures. Therefore, it is important and necessary to provide reliable information in a 181 timely manner via organizations in charge of the management of such information.

Governments should protect both transport users and operators from fake and unreliable 183 information. For the current pandemic, a study in Japan revealed that poor communication 184 between governments and the public may have been associated with the spread of COVID-19 185 in its early stages (Zhang, 2020) . Communications for fighting against COVID-19 and other 186 public health threats are a complex system, consisting of not only various stakeholders but 187 also interrelated phenomenal elements (e.g., lifestyles vs. behavioral changes, health vs. 188 mobility, employment vs. transport, tourism vs. regional economy, physical distancing vs. allows transport users to keep away from the virus and transport operators to prevent transport 202 users from being infected when using transport services (e.g., operators should avoid 203 operating crowded vehicles and users should avoid talking without wearing masks and talking 204 loudly). Avoidance is also applied to governments; for example, governments should avoid 205 making unstable policy decisions, providing inconsistent information, and behaving in 206 contradiction to their instructions to the public (e.g., not wearing masks even though the 207 public are requested to wear them). To make avoidance work effectively, governments should 208 make proper regulations before a pandemic occurs. Such regulations would allow 209 governments to regulate transport operators, for example, to avoid operating crowded 210 transport services and allow transport operators to require transport users to wear masks. The current pandemic has dramatically changed the way that economic and social systems run.

In other words, economic and social systems have to run "in a discontinuous manner with Governments need to substitute face-to-face governmental procedures with online ones.

277

Substitution between transport modes may also be needed, such as in the case of a lack of 278 vehicles owning to the need for more thorough disinfection procedures. The PASS approach targets transport users and operators (or service providers) as well as [1] People do not appreciate the risks they run. 329 [2] In line with human nature, a person who thinks they have only a slight cold is seldom 330 willing to shut themselves up in rigid isolation as a means of protecting others. 331 [3] The disease may be transmissible before the patient is aware that they are infected. 332 333 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 8 Soper further cited the following 12 rules that were recommended at that time. All 334 these recommendations are also applicable to the current pandemic. 335 [1] Avoid needless crowding; influenza is a crowd disease. 336 [2] Smother your coughs and sneezes; others do not want the germs you would throw away. 337 [3] Your nose, not your mouth, is for breathing; get the habit. 338 [4] Remember the three C's: a clean mouth, clean skin, and clean clothes. 339 [5] Try to keep cool when you walk and warm when you ride and sleep. 340 [6] Open the windows always at home at night and at the office when practicable. 341 [7] Food will win the war if you give it a chance; help your body by choosing and chewing 342 your food well. 343 [8] Your fate may be in your own hands; wash your hands before eating. 344 [9] Don't let the waste products of digestion accumulate; drink a glass or two of water on 345 getting up. 346 [10] Don't use a napkin, towel, spoon, fork, glass, or cup that has been used by another person 347 and not washed. 348 [11] Avoid tight clothes, tight shoes, tight gloves; seek to make nature your ally, not your 349 prisoner. 350 [12] When the air is pure, breathe all of it that you can; breathe deeply. another -they need air." The present author has no intention to criticize Soper. Rather, the 359 author argues that, as can be seen from the current pandemic, science has its own limitations 360 when a new phenomenon suddenly appears, even though it is also evident that science can 361 progress very rapidly in times of crises.

Here, the author attempts to apply the above PASS approach to make policy 363 recommendations for addressing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics in a 364 relatively comprehensive and seamless manner. procedures which would, otherwise, take too long to be adopted or would need to go through 

"Protect"

514 515Governments must protect transport users and service providers, including highly vulnerable 516 people (e.g., essential workers and low-income people) by properly monitoring and 517 supervising the implementation of protection measures that had been prepared in advance.

518

First, because essential mobility should be maintained, the safety of transport personnel is governments should promote a shared economy. In the transport sector, shared mobility 700 should be promoted. For example, taxi 5 , high-speed railway 6 , and public transport vehicles 701 (Lynott and Heller, 2020) can be used to deliver/transport goods. If physical distances can be 702 ensured, then restaurants and entertainment facilities can be tentatively transformed into 703 office spaces that allow people to work near their homes, thereby avoiding commuting trips.

704

Transport operators should restrict space sharing, especially for public transport users.

705

If operation resources (e.g., human resources and vehicles) become seriously lacking, 706 operators may have to share their operational resources (e.g., owning to absences of infected 707 staff and lack of disinfected vehicles 7 ). Regarding the sharing of operational resources, the 708 successful experience of mutual direct operation (sharing of tracks, other facilities, operation 709 staff, information, and rules) across railway/subway systems in Japan is worth referencing. In the case where facilities to accommodate infected patients are not enough, public 749 transport vehicles can be substituted as isolation units (BBC, 2020), and public transport 750 (including inter-city transport) can be used to transport infected patients (Lynott and Heller, 751 2020) and medical staff (Wong, 2020) . If transport capacity needs to be increased but it is 752 impossible to increase capacity of existing railway systems, then railway operators may have 753 to substitute railways with buses (i.e., allowing buses to replace railways for some rail lines).

754

Transport users should be encouraged to make full use of online activities (e.g., the environment. Transport operators should also modify their unsustainable business styles.

806

Behavioral changes toward resilience and sustainability should be made by all stakeholders.

807

The risk of using public transport remains unclear, as well as the variables that most 808 affect infectivity (e.g., length of time exposed, density of transport passengers, and level of air Conflict of interest statements 883 No potential conflicts of interest were disclosed. 884 885 886
