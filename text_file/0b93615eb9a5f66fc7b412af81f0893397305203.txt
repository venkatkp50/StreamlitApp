10 Table S7 . Summary of sera from BNT162b2-vaccinated individuals used in this study. 11 Table S8 . Primers used for the construction of Mu spike expression plasmid.12 Consortia 13were prepared in our previous studies. [3] [4] [5] A plasmid expressing the spike protein of the Mu (B.1.621) variant was generated by site-directed overlap extension PCR using pC-SARS2-S D614G 3 as the template and the primers listed in Table S8 . The resulting PCR fragment was digested with KpnI and NotI and inserted into the corresponding site of the pCAGGS vector. 6 Nucleotide sequences were determined by DNA sequencing services (Eurofins), and the sequence data were analyzed by Sequencher v5.1 software (Gene Codes Corporation).

Neutralization assay

Pseudoviruses were prepared as previously described. [3] [4] [5] 7 Briefly, lentivirus (HIV-1)-based, luciferase-expressing reporter viruses were pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 spikes. HEK293T cells (1 × 10 6 cells) were cotransfected with 1 μg psPAX2-IN/HiBiT, 8 1 μg pWPI-Luc2, 8 and 500 ng plasmids expressing parental S or its derivatives using PEI Max (Polysciences, Cat# 24765-1) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Two days post transfection, the culture supernatants were harvested and centrifuged. The pseudoviruses were stored at -80°C until use. Neutralization assays were performed as previously described. 4, 7 Briefly, the SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudoviruses (counting ~20,000 relative light units) were incubated with serially diluted (40-, 120-, 360-, 1,080-, 3,240-, 9,720-, and 29,160-fold dilution at the final concentration) heatinactivated human sera at 37°C for 1 h. Pseudoviruses without sera were included as controls. Then, an 80 μl mixture of pseudovirus and serum was added to HOS-ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells (10,000 cells/50 μl) in a 96-well white plate. Two days post infection, the infected cells were lysed with a One-Glo luciferase assay system (Promega, Cat# E6130), and the luminescent signal was measured using a GloMax explorer multimode microplate reader 3500 (Promega). The assay of each serum was performed in triplicate, and the 50% neutralization titer was calculated using Prism 9 (GraphPad Software).
