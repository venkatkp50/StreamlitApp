These microorganisms, including a number of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), have been increasingly applied in the domains of human medicine, food and agriculture production, etc. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Contradictorily, a few studies have demonstrated that probiotics are not universally good as they may even provoke the virulence of the pathogens 14, 15 .In accordance with the conventional medicinal notion, under the treatment with the same dosage of a probiotic, a host confronting a higher and lower amount of pathogen tends to be more and less compromised, respectively. However, in practice, as probiotics are surrounded by dynamic vulnerable (micro-)ecosystems affected significantly by versatile biotic, abiotic, spatial, temporal and anthropogenic backgrounds, the potential antagonism of probiotics agaist pathogens might be subject to change.To decipher the influence of a probiotic against various loads of a pathogen on a vertebrate host, so as to steer and galvanize its beneficial efficacies, typical probiotic and pathogenic isolates belonging to well-known groups of microorganisms, i.e. LAB and Vibrionaceae, respectively, were used to establish an indicative interaction model in the aquatic animal model with zebrafish (Danio rerio) (Fig. 1) . The outcome, exposing the selective contribution (dual contrary-antagonism) of probiotic and contradicting the aforementioned conventional medicinal After exclusion of those related to regular basic biological processes, the sole remaining shared gene orthogroup is related to quorum sensing and represented in both Lactiplantibacillus 17 and Vibrio ( Table 1 ). The corresponding gene is luxS, which is responsible for the production and detection of the signal molecule autoinducer-2 in quorum sensing circuit 19 . According to Song et al. 15, 17 , Lactiplantibacillus and Vibrio are capable of using the signal molecules (autoinducers) to launch inter-genus communication via a quorum-sensing cascade. The genome information and genome-based phylogeny of Lactip. plantarum strain L75a and V. parahaemolyticus strain 64 are displayed in Extended Data Fig. 7 .Are the probiotic metabolites attributed to the benefit or detriment of the probiotic to the pathogen? Concerning the probiotic metabolites, the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) identified 10 significantly abundant metabolites in the extracellular cell-free fermented broth of Lactip. plantarum strain L75a when their peak intensity was compared with the control (fold-change > 100). These 10 metabolites included gluconic acid, (4S,5S)-4,5-dihydroxy-2,6-dioxohexanoate, (S)-beta-tyrosine, 1D-chiro-inositol, cellobiono-1,5-lactone, 3-aminopentanedioate, urocanic acid, pyrrolidonecarboxylic acid, 4-hydroxybutanoic acid, pyruvic acid (Fig. 3) .As the potential inhibitory agents [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] , gluconic acid, tyrosine, pyrrolidinone and butyric acid-related compounds might be detrimental to V. parahaemolyticus via direct inhibition, and the last compound(s) might also act via inhibiting quorum sensing of the pathogen. Since the concentration of each metabolite was consistent in all corresponding treatments, they could jointly express the same level of antagonism against V. parahaemolyticus at the higher and lower densities.As the potential environmental signals [26] [27] [28] , the glutamate-derived compound(s) might be conducive to the virulence of V. parahaemolyticus either dependently or independently of quorum sensing mechanism, while for tyrosine-derived compound(s), such mechanism is needed; moreover, the pyruvate-derived compound(s) might be conducive or suppressive to V. parahaemolyticus depending on the cell density of the pathogen via quorum sensing pathway.Further, as Lactip. plantarum strain L75a and V. parahaemolyticus strain 64 do not exploit the same carbon sources (Extended Data Table 3 ), they thus exhibit no known competitive relationship with respect to their nutritional niche. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Are the integrated genetic and metabolic aspects attributed to the benefit or detriment of the probiotic to the pathogen? With regard to the (co-)evolution of species' niches of Lactip. plantarum strain L75a and V. parahaemolyticus strain 64, as they possess overlap in the quorum sensing-related genetic niche (Table 1) , the virulence of the pathogen at higher and lower density might be contained or aggravated (Fig. 2a,b) by the probiotic-pathogen inter-genus quorum sensing without transforming the commensal microbiome configuration in the host (Fig. 2c ).i) The probiotic-pathogen inter-genus quorum sensing: pathogen at a higher density In the treatment of V. parahaemolyticus strain 64 at a higher density accompanying Lactip. plantarum strain L75a (Fig. 2) , detection of the signal molecules (e.g. autoinducer-2, Table 1 ) and metabolites (e.g. pyruvate-related compound(s), (Fig. 3) ) from Lactip. plantarum by the quorum sensing receptors might 'lead to virulence gene repression' 27, 29, 30 in V. parahaemolyticus. Meanwhile, Lactip. plantarum might be triggered to antagonize V. parahaemolyticus only when the pathogen is at a higher density (higher levels of autoinducers from the pathogen) compared to that at a lower density; so, there might be a confrontation/competitive balance between the probiotic and the higher-density pathogen, which circumscribed/surpassesed the viciousness of V. parahaemolyticus and had as a result that the zebrafish was healthy (Fig. 2a,b ). All these pathways might rely on the regulation by the luxS gene, which is located at the overlap in the genomes of Lactip. plantarum strain L75a and V. parahaemolyticus strain 64 (Table 1) .ii) The probiotic-pathogen inter-genus quorum sensing: pathogen at a lower density According to literatures, the signal molecules are capable of inducing virulence of Vibrio at a low cell density 29 and furnishing the inter-genus communication of Lactiplantibacillus and Vibrio via quorum sensing 15, 17 ; so, comparing to the treatment of the pathogen at a higher density with the probiotic strain, in the treatment of V. parahaemolyticus strain 64 at a lower density accompanying Lactip. plantarum strain L75a (Fig. 2) , the autoinducer(s) ( Table 1) and metabolites (Fig. 3 ) secreted by Lactip. plantarum might 'activate virulence gene expression, 27, 29, 30 in V. parahaemolyticus, which jeopardized the health of D. rerio (Fig. 2a,b) . Interestingly, these virulence regulation in Vibrio at molecular, genetic and chemical levels are related to the luxS gene regulation (Table 1) .Moreover, since the quorum sensing-regulated luminescence (of the type strain V. campbellii BB120, Extended Data Fig. 3a ) and virulence 14, 17 of Vibrio could be spurred by the cells of Lactiplantibacillus, the intimate cell-tocell contact of Lactip. plantarum strain L75a and V. parahaemolyticus strain 64 might be another contributor to compromise the host D. rerio.Concluding remarks. Probiotics might be beneficial to pathogens, but also detrimental. Generally, the efficacies of currently-good 'probiotics' are assessed under constricted experimental scenarios, which are deficient in providing extensive facets to discover their long-term and widespread influences. Whether or not the application of a probiotic would mitigate or exacerbate the virulence of pathogens towards versatile hosts, e.g., a subhealthy/slightly compromised host or a diseased/highly stressed host (as evoked by the pathogen at a lower or higher density, respectively), is still pending for clever investigations on the fitness of the probiotics. Indeed, the beneficial activities of probiotics are tricky to maintain and regulate. To achieve by means of probiotics improvement of human and animal well-being, careful attention to and in-depth reseach of the probiotic-pathogen interaction is warranted.Meanwhile, to safeguard the use of probiotics, rigorous rules and regulations are obligatory to stipulate the stringent manufacturing and formulation benchmarks 31, 32 . To secure 'life below water' of the 'FAO sustainable development goals' , scientists are urging to implement microbiome studies and microbial management on aquatic animals and their living environment 33, 34 . Recently, FAO has raised 'bolster trade and food safety standards' as one of the seven priority areas to minimise the detrimental effects of COVID-19 35 . Our study is informative for organisations, such as FAO, OIE and WHO, to improve their guidelines to regulate and standardize probiotic assessments, utilization and production. Figure 2 .

Co., Ltd., Guangzhou, Guangdong, China) and heat sensitive chemicals, other media and solutions used in this study were prepared in ultrapure water and autoclaved at 121 Â°C for 15 min before use; agar containing media were supplemented with 1.5-1.8% agar (BioFroxx GmbH, Einhausen, Germany), unless mentioned otherwise. The Luria-Bertani broth/agar, LB0, LB5, LB10 or LB35 broth/agar, consisted of 0.0%, 0.5%, 1% or 3.5% NaCl, respectively; 1% tryptone (Oxoid Ltd., Hampshire, England); 0.5% yeast extract (Oxoid Ltd., Hants, UK); and without/with agar.Isolation of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and Vibrionaceae. Litopenaeus vannamei and the rearing water from each of the four farms in Gruangdong Province, China, and Larimichthys polyactis, Odontamblyopus rubicundus, Takifugu ocellatus, Penaeus monodon, Scylla serrata and water from The South China Sea were collected in more than one replicate. These samples were either handled immediately after collection (within 30 min) or kept in ice and handled within 3-4 h. Small portion of each of the four organs (muscle, intestine, hepatopancreas and gill) from Li. vannamei and the intestine from the other aquatic animals were excised and put into a 1.5-ml sterile tube containing 100 Î¼l 0.8% saline and three glass beads of Ã˜ 3 mm. Each organ was homogenized by a BiologixÂ® vortex mixer (Jinan, Shandong, China) for 1-5 min at maximal speed. To isolate LAB, 5 Î¼l or 1-2 Î¼l of each homogenized organ was spread-plated (in triplicate) or spot-inoculated (in 12 replicates), respectively, on the LAB semi-selective medium, MRS broth (Guangdong Huankai Microbial Sci. & Tech. Co., Ltd., Guangzhou, Guangdong, China) supplemented with agar (MRS agar); the water samples were inoculated directly on MRS agar with the same methods. Li. vannamei and the rearing water of Farm 1 was not dedicated for LAB isolation.To isolate Vibrionaceae, 5 Î¼l of each homogenized organ was spread-plated on TCBS agar in triplicate, or, the bacteria were collected by spearing a sterile needle in each of the organs of Li. vannamei and gently streakplating on TCBS agar in one replicate; the water samples were inoculated directly on TCBS agar with the same methods, or a water droplet of 2-30 Î¼l was spread-plated on TCBS agar.The MRS and TCBS agar plates were incubated at 27 Â± 3 Â°C for 24-48 and 18 h, respectively. From each colony morphology (colour and shape) of each water sample or of each organ of each aquatic animal, 2-5 (or one, if not sufficient) single colonies were picked from the MRS and TCBS agar, and purified by streak-plating on MRS and 1/10 th strength LB5 / LB10 agar, respectively. Each purified isolate was grown in MRS and LB10 broth, respectively, and preserved in 20-40% glycerol (Sigma-Aldrich, Co., MO, USA) at âˆ’ 80 Â°C.

Identification and 16S rRNA gene-based phylogeny of LAB and Vibrionaceae isolates. Firstly,

after preservation in 20-40% glycerol at âˆ’ 80 Â°C, isolates from MRS agar that were capable of reviving in MRS and LB0 broth, and isolates from TCBS agar in LB5 and LB10 broth were sent to BGI (Shenzhen, Guangdong, China) for 16S rRNA gene sequencing by using only the forward primer to initiate the synthesis of the fragments from the 3â€² end. After the fragments were analysed by BLASTn 36 on the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database website (www. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/), all isolates identified as LAB or Vibrionaceae (Extended Data Table 1 ) were sent for 16S rRNA gene sequencing by using the reverse primer to initiate the synthesis of the fragments from the 5â€² end. For each isolate, the two fragments from the 3â€² and 5â€² ends with good quality were aligned to generate a contig. As reference sequences, 16S rRNA gene sequences with good quality of 268 LAB type strains, including all 205 'Lactobacillus' (this term represents the former genus name which has been reclassified into 25 genera as proposed by Zheng and colleagues 17 ), 19 Leuconostoc, 13 Lactococcus, 12 Pediococcus and 19 Weissella strains, and 139 Vibrionaceae type strains, including all 103 Vibrio, 6 Aliivibrio, 4 Enterovibrio and 26 Photobacterium strains, were obtained from the Ribosomal Database Project 37 (RDP, http:// rdp. cme. msu. edu/). All the 16S rRNA gene sequences (â‰¥ 1200 bp) of the isolates and type strains were subjected to phylogenetic analyses with ClustalW in MEGA7 38 to generate the neighbour-joining 39 consensus trees for LAB and Vibrionaceae, with 1000 bootstrap replicates 40 . The evolutionary distances were calculated by the Kimura-2-parameter model 41 and the non-uniformity of evolutionary rates amongst sites were determined using discrete Gamma distributions.

Motility and enzymatic characterization of 28 LAB and 37 Vibrionaceae isolates. According

to the 16S rRNA gene-based phylogenetic analyses, 28 LAB and 37 Vibrionaceae isolates, which represented proportionally to the abundance, diversity and origin (including location, host, environment and organ) among all LAB and Vibrionaceae isolates, respectively, were selected for functional characterization. These isolates were inoculated in MRS and LB10 broth, respectively, and incubated at 200 r.p.m. at 28 Â°C for 1-3 days. The cells of each culture were washed once by centrifugation at 5000 Ã— g for 5 min at room temperature to remove the supernatant and the cell pellets were resuspended in ultrapure water (for LAB isolates) and 1% saline (for Vibrionaceae isolates). After determination of the cell density of each suspension with a spectrophotometer (BioTekÂ® Synergyâ„¢ HTX multi-mode reader, BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA) at 600 nm (OD 600 ), each cell suspension was adjusted to a final density of 10 9 cells ml âˆ’1 , and 3 Î¼l of each suspension was spot-inoculated on each medium in triplicate and each assay was performed aerobically at 28 Â°C. The adjusted protocols will be mentioned otherwise.The swimming and swarming media were prepared in MRS (for LAB isolates) and LB10 (for Vibrionaceae isolates) broth supplemented with 0.3% (w/v) and 0.6% (w/v) agar, respectively. The control medium for Vibrionaceae was LB10 broth supplemented with 1.5% (w/v) agar. 2 Î¼l of each cell suspension was spot-inoculated at the centre of each medium. The swimming and swarming plates for LAB and Vibrionaceae isolates were incubated at www.nature.com/scientificreports/ 26 Â± 2 Â°C for 42 and 18 h, respectively. After incubation, the swimming and swarming activities were determined by measurement of the motility outgrowth from the inoculum point. The amylase indicator media for LAB and Vibrionaceae isolates consisted of 1% (w/v) wheat powder and LB0 agar supplemented without and with 1% NaCl, respectively. The agar plates were incubated for 14 and 2 days, respectively.The lipase indicator media for LAB and Vibrionaceae isolates consisted of MRS and LB10 agar supplemented with 0.6% lecithin from soybean, respectively. The agar plates were incubated for 7 days and 2 days, respectively.The protease indicator media for LAB and Vibrionaceae isolates consisted of 1.5% Difcoâ„¢ skim milk powder (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and agar supplemented without and with LB10 broth, respectively. The agar plates were incubated for 7 days and 1 day, respectively.The indicator media of feed degradation consisted of 1% (w/v) ground and sieved (through a sieve with the pore size of 425 Î¼m) shrimp feed (type: No. 0, Guangdong Yuehai feed group, Guangdong, China) supplemented without and with 1% NaCl for LAB and Vibrionaceae isolates, respectively. The agar plates were incubated for 7-8 days.The faeces of Li. vannamei was firstly sun-dried and then dried in an oven at 60 Â°C for 24 h. The shell and muscle of Li. vannamei were dried in an oven at 105 Â°C for 6 h. After drying, each matter was ground, sieved (through a sieve with the pore size of 425 Î¼m), weighed, put in glass bottles and autoclaved. Afterwards, each sterile matter was dried at 60 Â°C until it was visibly dried and the condensation inside the bottle disappeared. Then, each matter was proportionally mixed with the autoclaved 1.5% agar (w/v) supplemented without and with 1% NaCl, to test the corresponding degradation activity of the LAB and Vibrionaceae isolates, respectively. Each matter was suspended at 1% (w/v) in each medium. For LAB and Vibrionaceae isolates, the faeces agar plates were incubated for 14 and 7 days, respectively; the shell and muscle agar plates for 14 and 2 days, respectively.The corresponding enzymatic activity was determined by measurement of the degradation halo around and/or within the inoculum. Vague or weak activity was considered as positive for the corresponding activity.

Production of LAB-fermented both.

To produce LAB-fermented both, a pre-grown culture of each LAB isolate was inoculated into fresh MRS broth to reach an initial density of 10 5 cells ml âˆ’1 . The liquid portion of each culture took 10% of the volume inside the container and each culture was incubated at 200 r.p.m. at 28 Â°C for 24 h. The final density of each fermented broth was approximately 10 9 cells ml âˆ’1 . As a control treatment, the MRS broth was not inoculated with LAB.To collect the cell-free fermented broth of each isolate, each whole fermented broth was centrifuged, and the supernatant was filter-sterilized through a 0.22-Âµm MillexÂ® syringe-driven filter unit (Merck Millipore Ltd., Co. Cork, Ireland) and then stored at âˆ’ 20 Â°C before use.Antagonism of the metabolites of the 28 LAB isolates against the 37 Vibrionaceae isolates and the type strain V. campbellii BB120. The antagonism indicator assay aimed at testing the impact of the cell-free fermented broth of each of the 28 LAB isolates on the proliferation of each of the 37 Vibrionaceae isolates and on the type strain V. campbellii BB120 (ATCCÂ® BAA-1116). To imitate the dosage range of the already-applied/commercial LAB fermented broth under the realistic farming conditions, each cell-free fermented broth and the non-inoculated MRS broth (control treatment) was diluted 10 4 -, 10 5 -and 10 6 -times with LB10 broth. The aforementioned cell suspension (10 9 cells ml âˆ’1 ) of each Vibrionaceae isolate was added to each diluted cell-free fermented broth to make a culture mixture with an initial density of 10 5 cells ml âˆ’1 . 100 Î¼l of each culture mixture was added into a well of a CostarÂ® 96-well cell culture plate (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA). Each treatment was performed in triplicate. The standing cultures were incubated at 28 Â°C and OD 600 values were determined after incubation for 0, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 24 h. The proliferation of a Vibrionaceae isolate treated with a diluted cell-free fermented broth was determined as inhibited or stimulated when the mean OD 600 value of such culture was consistently at least 0.1 lower or 0.2 higher than that of the corresponding control culture during the exponential growth phase within 24 h, respectively. A similar experimental setup was exploited to test the impact of the metabolites on the proliferation of the type strain V. campbellii BB120: each cell-free fermented broth and the non-inoculated MRS broth (control treatment) were diluted with LB35 broth accordingly, and the OD 600 values were measured after incubation for 0, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20 and 24 h. Impact of the fermented broths of the three representative LAB isolates on the bioluminescence and proliferation of V. campbellii BB120. Three representative LAB isolates, W. hellenica strain L43, Lactip. plantarum strain L75a and Lacto. lactis strain L80, were selected for further investigation.The bioluminescence indicator assay was conducted to test the impact of the cell-free supernatant, the cells and the whole fermented broth of each representative isolate on the bioluminescence of the type strain V. campbellii BB120. The cells of V. campbellii BB120 were washed once and resuspended in 1% saline to a final density of 10 9 cells ml âˆ’1 . The cell-free and whole fermented broths were prepared as described above and the control treatment was the non-inoculated MRS broth. The cells of each fermented broth were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in ultrapure water of the same volume, and the control treatment was 1% saline. All the tested cell-free supernatants, the cells, the whole fermented broths and the MRS broth were not luminescent; each of them was diluted 50-and 100-times with 1% saline. The cell suspension of V. campbellii BB120 was added to each diluted content to make a culture mixture with an initial density of 10 8 cells ml âˆ’1 of V. campbellii BB120. 100 Î¼l of each culture mixture was added into a well of a 96-well white cell culture plate (Thermo Scientific Nunc, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rochester, NY, USA). Each treatment was performed in triplicate. Each culture was measured within 15 min after the culture mixture was prepared. The gain value was set at 135. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ To verify whether the decrease in bioluminescence was due to growth inhibition of V. campbellii BB120, after the bioluminescence was determined, the growth (OD 600 ) of V. campbellii BB120 was measured after 24 h of incubation.

Safety evaluation of the three representative LAB isolates (I). The cells of each representative

LAB isolate, W. hellenica strain L43, Lactip. plantarum strain L75a and Lacto. lactis strain L80, were pre-grown, washed once, resuspended in ultrapure water and adjusted to a density of 10 9 cells ml âˆ’1 .

Each cell suspension was added to each medium to make a culture mixture with an initial density of 10 6 cells ml âˆ’1 . 100 Î¼l of each culture mixture was added into a well of a 96-well cell culture plate. Each treatment was performed in quadruplicate. OD 600 values of the standing cultures were determined after incubation for 24 and 48 h.To test the cytotoxicity of the cell-free supernatant and cells of the fermented broth of each isolate on the Epithelioma Papulosum Cyprini (EPC), 100 Î¼l EPC (6 Ã— 10 5 -1 Ã— 10 7 cells ml âˆ’1 ) was added into each well of a 96-well cell culture plate and incubated for 24 h before use. The cell-free fermented broth of each isolate was added into each well to reach the 10-, 10 2 -, 10 3 -, 10 4 -, 10 5 -and 10 6 -times dilutions of the original fermented broth. The cells of each isolate were washed three times and added into each well to the final densities of 10 3 , 10 4 , 10 5 , 10 6 , 10 7 and 10 8 cells ml âˆ’1 . After the standing cultures were incubated for 24 h, 50 Î¼l of one-time diluted MTT solution (MTT Cell Proliferation and Cytotoxicity Assay Kit, Jiangsu Keygen Biotech Corp., Ltd., Nanjing, Jiangsu, China) was added into each well and then the cultures were incubated for 4 h. The next procedures were conducted according to manufacturer's protocol. Finally, the OD 490 values were determined. The control treatment was the untreated EPC.To prepare the bile salt and pH tolerance assays, the bile salts (No. 3, Guangdong Huankai Microbial Sci. & Tech. Co., Ltd., Guangzhou, Guangdong, China) were added to LB0 broth to the final concentrations of 0.0%, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, 2%, 2.5% and 3% (w/v), respectively, and the LB0 broth was diluted to 70% strength; the pH values of MRS broth was adjusted to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 by addition of HCl or NaOH.

Safety evaluation of the three representative LAB isolates (II)-testing for antibiotic susceptibility. 69 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Pre-cultivation, transfer and acclimatization of Li. vannamei shrimp. Upon arrival in the aquaculture laboratory, the Li. vannamei were pre-cultivated in the rearing water containing 0.5% seawater crystal (Yanzhibaoâ„¢, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China) in a recirculation aquaculture system (RAS) for at least 14 days before use. The testing system was located in a room at the ambient temperature of 28 Â± 2 Â°C. 10 Li. vannamei of approximately 4 cm were gently introduced to each opaque testing unit (Ã˜18.9 cm) and allowed to acclimatize for at least 4 h. Each testing unit contained 3 L of RAS water and was covered with an opaque lid to maintain darkness and insulation without blocking aeration, which was supplied continuously by an air stone connected to an air pump.Safety evaluation of the three representative LAB isolates (III)-pathogenicity to Li. vannamei. The fermented broth of Lactip. plantarum strain L75a was added to each testing unit to reach 10 3 -, 10 4 -, 10 5 -and 10 6 -times dilution, and that of W. hellenica strain L43 and Lacto. lactis strain L80 to reach 10 3 -and 10 4 -times dilution.

The cell-free and whole fermented broths of Lactip. plantarum strain L75a were prepared as described above; the cells of the fermented broth were collected by centrifugation and resuspending in the same volume of 0.5% saline; each of them was diluted 10 2 -, 10 3 -and 10 4 -times with 0.5% saline. The cells of V. parahaemolyticus strain 64 were pre-grown in LB5 broth, washed once, resuspended in 0.5% saline, and added to each of the three diluted contents of the fermented broth to make a culture mixture with an initial Vibrio density of 10 5 cells ml âˆ’1 . In the control treatments, the Vibrio cells were treated with 0.5% saline only. Each treatment was performed in triplicate. The standing co-cultures were incubated at 26 Â± 2 Â°C and determined for the colony forming unit (CFU) on TCBS and/or MRS agar in triplicate after incubation for 0, 4 and 8 h. On day 0, 2 and 4, the cells of V. parahaemolyticus strain 64 were washed once and added to each testing unit, containing 10 D. rerio (Tuebingen from Pearl River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China) in 3.5-L rearing water, to reach the densities of 10 4 (lower density) and 10 6 (higher density) cells ml âˆ’1 , respectively; the aforementioned pre-treated shrimp muscle was introduced to the corresponding rearing water, respectively. On day 2 and 4, the water containing lower and higher cell densities of V. parahaemolyticus strain 64 was supplemented with or without the 10 4 -times-diluted fermented broth of Lactip. plantarum strain L75a. The D. rerio in the two control treatments were untreated or treated only with the10 4 -times-diluted fermented broth. Each treatment was conducted in triplicate. pH level was stabilized at 7.8 Â± 0.1 during the entire test, as measured by a pH meter (PH-220 W, Hangzhou Qiwei Instrument Co., LTD, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China). Dead fish were removed when observed. Aeration from an air pump was provided continuously during the entire test. Scoring was conducted after 9 days of cultivation when the fish survival of at least two replicates of the same treatment was just down to 50%.

Bacterial community in D. rerio. Immediately after the fish survival was scored, four fish of each testing unit were collected and anesthetized by ice water; the muscle, liver and intestine of every two fish were excised www.nature.com/scientificreports/ and mixed in one RNAase-free tube, respectively. Therefore, the fish of each treatment were sampled in sextuplicate. The samples were stored at âˆ’ 80 Â°C until further processing. DNA extraction, PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene (with an inclusion of 0.2 Âµl BSA within each 20-Âµl mixture for the PCR reaction), Illumina MiSeq sequencing and processing of the sequencing data were performed by Majorbio Bio-Pharm Technology Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China) according to the protocols described by Wang and colleagues. 42 Histology of D. rerio. A similar D. rerio bioassay was conducted in a smaller scale (one replicate per treatment) to collect the fish tissues. On the day when the survival of anyone of the treatments went just down to 50%, one fish of each treatment was collected and the muscle, liver and intestine were dissected.To prepare the haematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tissue sections, each organ sample was fixed in Bouin's solution for 3 days at room temperature. Further processing and photomicrography of the sections were conducted by Wuhan Servicebio Technology Co., Ltd (Wuhan, Hubei, China) based on Servicebio's in-house protocols.To prepare the tissue sections for transmission electron microscopy (TEM), each organ sample was fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer (pH7.0) for 10 days at 5 Â°C. Afterwards, each fixed tissue was post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide at room temperature for 3 h and dehydrated with gradient ethanol. Then, each sample was transferred in acetone and embedded in Spurr's resin (SPI Chemâ„¢ Low Viscosity "Spurr" Kits, Structure Probe, Inc., West Chester, PA, USA). A 70-nm ultra-thin section of each sample was cut by a Reichert microtome (Leica em uc7, Wetzlar, Germany) and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The photomicrographic images of each stained section was captured with a Talos L120C transmission electron microscope (FEIâ„¢, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hillsboro, Oregon, USA) connected to an image analyzer system. Genomic DNA extraction and genome sequencing. Lactip. plantarum strain L75a and V. parahaemolyticus strain 64 were respectively grown in LB0 and LB10 broth at 28 Â°C for 24 h.
