Secondly, data regarding the need for inotropic, mechanical or ventilatory support, which are required in the more severe form of STEMI with concomitant cardiogenic shock and per se associated with a worst prognosis, have not been presented by the authors [4] . Thirdly, the duration of the procedure, the length of stented vessel/s, the presence of calcifications and the use of rotational atherectomy may represent other confounding factors that require a careful attention, especially when assessing the IST rate [5] . Therefore, because SARS-CoV-2 patients undergoing PCI would potentially be at a different risk of IST and short-term mortality than expected from the result of this study, further analysis is required to assess the real correlation between STEMI revascularization and in-hospital mortality and/or IST in COVID-19 patients.
