INTRODUCTION 67

The innate immune response within a mammalian cell is the first line of defense against 68 an invading pathogen. However, as obligate intracellular parasites, viruses have evolved 69 numerous mechanisms to prevent and antagonize innate detection by host cells. Viruses lacking ExoN activity are sensitive to the effects of IFN-β. Binding of type I 123 interferon to the IFNAR receptor on the cell surface leads to a Jak/STAT signaling cascade that 124 ultimately results in the up-regulation and expression of hundreds of antiviral ISGs (4). In 125 addition, WT-MHV replication has been shown to be relatively resistant to the effects of IFN (1, 126 3, 22) . To determine whether the ExoN activity of MHV nsp14 was required for resistance to 127 IFN, we pretreated murine delayed brain tumor (DBT) cells with increasing concentrations of 128 mouse IFN-β for 18 h prior to infecting with WT-MHV or ExoN(-) virus at a multiplicity of 129 infection (MOI) of 1 plaque-forming unit (PFU) per cell (Fig. 1A) . In response to IFN-β 130 pretreatment, WT-MHV viral titer decreased by approximately 1 log 10 as previously reported (1) . 131In contrast, ExoN(-) viral titer demonstrated a dose-dependent decrease and resulted in an 132 approximately 3 log 10 decrease in viral titer relative to untreated ExoN(-) viral titers. The ExoN 133 activity of nsp14 is conferred by active site residues present in 3 different motifs within the 134 ExoN domain (23). Therefore, to determine whether the observed sensitivity to IFN-β 135 pretreatment for ExoN(-) virus in Fig. 1A Therefore, first, we tested whether ExoN3(-) and ExoN(-) demonstrated similar sensitivity to 5-141 FU to ensure that the ExoN activity of ExoN3(-) virus had been ablated. Similar to ExoN(-), 142ExoN3(-) viral replication in cells treated with increasing concentrations of 5-FU demonstrated a 143 dose-dependent decrease in viral titer relative to vehicle treated cells (Fig. 1B) . Further, ExoN(-) 144 and ExoN3(-) displayed similar sensitivities to pre-treatment with 100 or 500 U/mL IFN-β 145 following infection at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell (Fig. 1C) . Thus, these data suggest nsp14 ExoN 146 activity is required for resistance to the effects of IFN-β pretreatment and subsequent up-147 regulation and expression of ISGs. 148 149 Increased replication capacity does not confer resistance to the effects of IFN-β 150 pretreatment for viruses lacking ExoN activity. ExoN(-) virus demonstrates an approximately 151 2 h delay in exponential replication and a 1 log 10 decrease in peak titer relative to WT-MHV 152 (15). Therefore, we tested whether the IFN sensitivity phenotype observed for ExoN(-) and 153ExoN3(-) viruses is due to the decreased replication capacity of these viruses. To do so, we 154 utilized an ExoN(-) virus developed by our lab that has been blindly passaged in DBT cells for 155 250 passages [ExoN(-) P250] (24). The replication capacity of the resulting ExoN(-) P250 virus 156 exceeds that of WT-MHV ( Fig. 2A) . However, despite increased replication capacity, ExoN(-) 157 P250 demonstrated similar sensitivity to IFN-β pretreatment as ExoN(-) virus ( Fig. 2A and B) . 158Hence, the IFN-β sensitivity phenotype of viruses lacking ExoN activity is not dependent on 159 viral replication capacity but instead, is directly associated with a specific function of nsp14 160ExoN that is required for efficient replication in the presence of an IFN-β-mediated antiviral 161 state. 162 163 Nsp14 ExoN activity is required for replication in wild-type B6 BMMs. We next wanted to 164 test whether ExoN activity was required for IFN resistance in primary innate immune cells, such 165 as BMMs. Replication of WT-MHV in primary BMMs is well described, and data suggest that 166 wild-type B6 BMMs (B6) express many PRRs and ISGs at a higher basal level than many mouse 167 cell lines (3, 25, 26). In contrast, BMMs lacking the IFNAR receptor (IFNAR-/-) have lower  168   basal and expressed levels of ISGs; thus, making B6 and IFNAR-/-BMMs excellent cell types  169   for interrogating the role of ExoN activity on viral replication and antagonism of the innate  170 immune response (25). BMMs from B6 or IFNAR-/-mice were generated and infected with 171 WT-MHV or ExoN(-) virus at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell. Samples were harvested at the indicated 172 time points, and viral titers were determined by plaque assay (Fig. 3A) . CoVs encode multiple IFN antagonists that prevent the induction of or mediate resistance to the 303 innate immune response; thus, allowing efficient viral replication early during infection (3). 304Moreover, an insufficient innate immune response has been proposed to be a major contributor 305 to SARS-CoV pathogenesis (29). In this study, we sought to determine the contributions of 306 nsp14 ExoN activity in the induction of and resistance to the innate immune response. We 307 demonstrate that ExoN(-) virus is sensitive to pretreatment with IFN-β. Because ExoN3(-) and 308ExoN(-) P250 viruses were also sensitive to the effects of IFN, we conclude that IFN sensitivity 309 is specifically due to loss of ExoN activity. (Fig.4A) . Interestingly, TGEV ExoN active site 337 mutants were non-viable; although, this is not the first report of non-viable ExoN active site 338 residue mutants in Alphacoronaviruses (21). In the initial report of CoV nsp14 ExoN activity, 339 human CoV 229E ExoN active site mutants were also non-viable, suggesting a common essential 340 function for nsp14 ExoN in Alphacoronavirus replication and/or innate antagonism (13). 341Altogether, the possibility of a common innate immune antagonism function for nsp14 across 342Alpha-and Beta-CoVs is apparent but clearly differing requirements exist that may be dependent 343 on the CoV genus and cell types used. 344Our results clearly demonstrate that viruses lacking ExoN activity are sensitive to IFN-β 345 pretreatment in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A,C and Fig. 2) . Further, replication of viruses 346 lacking ExoN activity was dependent on the capacity of BMMs to express genes downstream of 347 IFNAR signaling (Fig. 3) . This is due to the fact that B6 and IFNAR-/-cells have different levels 348 of basal ISG expression and thus, two very different intracellular environments for viral 349 replication to occur (3, 25, 26). In IFNAR-/-BMMs, ExoN(-) and ExoN(-) P250 virus replication 350 capacity was restored to levels approaching or exceeding WT-MHV levels (Fig. 3) . Further, our 351 specific infectivity (Fig. 6A ) and co-infection (Fig. 6B) Since CoVs encode the largest genome known for RNA viruses, they have the luxury of 375 encoding multiple IFN antagonists that limit the capacity of a cell to detect and respond to 376 infection. Collectively, our data suggest that MHV nsp14 ExoN activity is a contributor to CoV 377 innate immune antagonism. We clearly demonstrate that viruses lacking ExoN activity are 378 sensitive to the effects of an IFN-β-mediated antiviral state. Further, our data reveal a critical role 379 for nsp14 ExoN activity in CoV replication and provide additional rationale for targeting nsp14 380ExoN activity as a means of viral attenuation. Our future studies will probe the specific 381 mechanism of restriction for viruses lacking ExoN activity and assess how the requirement of 382ExoN activity for resistance to innate immunity can be utilized for treatment during human has been previously described (14). Briefly, an RNA standard was prepared using the MHV A 451 fragment (37) and a standard curve was generated using 10-fold dilutions from 10 3 to 10 8 copies. Purification System. Genome RNA was quantified using one-step qRT-PCR as described above, 479 and the particle to PFU ratio was calculated.
