Antiviral drugs are hard to develop and drug resistance is a serious concern, especially when these 39 drugs are used in massive quantities, as it invariably happens during pandemic settings. In pandemics 40with new infectious agents there are usually no specific drugs to the microbe and the first impulse is 41 to test available agents for antimicrobial efficacy, in so called repurposing drug efforts. Consequently, 42when the COVID-19 pandemic began physicians initially turned to known drugs to find some that were 43 active against SARS-CoV-2, including antiviral agents developed against other viruses. The most 44 successful example of repurposing a drug for COVID-19 was remdesivir, a drug originally designed as 45 a therapeutic for Ebolavirus. Given the absence of other small molecule antivirals remdesivir was 46 widely used in massive quantities during the first year of the pandemic, at the beginning within clinical 47 trials as well as off-label and emergency 3authorized prescriptions, and later for fully authorized 48 prescriptions 49The largest Coronaviridae polyprotein PP1ab is encoded by ORF1ab, which is cleaved by the proteases 50PLpro and 3CLpro into the non-structural proteins (Nsp1-16) to form the replicase machinery (Romano 51 et al., 2020) . Among them, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which consists of Nsp12-52Nsp7-Nsp8, is targeted by numerous nucleoside analogs. Some polymerase inhibitors (Gordon et al., 53 2020; Shen et al., 2020) are currently being tested in clinical studies to target SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, 54including favipiravir (T-705) (Furuta et al., 2013) , remdesivir (GS-5734, Veklury®) (Agostini et al., 2018) , 55ribavirin (Morgenstern et al., 2005) , penciclovir (Wang et al., 2020a) , galidesivir (BCX-4430) (Lim et al., 56 2017) and ponatinib (Imnovid®) (Chan et al., 2021; Najjar et al., 2015) . Additionally, molecular docking 57 studies predict potential efficacy for other drugs such as simeprevir, filibuvir and tegobuvir (Ruan et 58 al., 2021) on the basis of anticipated binding to RdRp. Recently, the orally available molnupiravir (MK-59 4482, EIDD-2801, Lagevrio®, Molxvir®) showed efficacy in phase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCT) 60 in COVID-19 patients. Among these drugs remdesivir and molnupiravir were the most promising 61 candidates, being able to evade the proofreading exonuclease (Agostini et al., 2018) and inducing a 62 phenomenon variably known as "error catastrophe" (Eigen and Schuster, 1977) , "lethal mutagenesis" 63 (Loeb et al., 1999) or "mutational meltdown" (Lynch and Gabriel, 1990 ) during viral RNA replication. 64More in details, it consists of G-to-A and C-to-U transitions via 2-step mutagenesis, where increased 65 mutations hinder viral fitness (Kabinger et al., 2021; Malone and Campbell, 2021) . However, by 66 targeting mitochondrial RNA polymerase (Sheahan et al., 2020; Sticher et al., 2020) , they are also 67 intrinsically mutagenic for human RNA and DNA (Zhou et al., 2021) . Accordingly, remdesivir has been 68 postulated to increase the rate of immune escape mutations (Colson et al., 2021) . Furthermore, 69 remdesivir has poor penetration in lungs (Wang and Chen, 2020) , and could facilitate emergence of 70 compartmentalized resistance (Boshier et al., 2021) . 71The characterization of a remdesivir-resistant signature has relevant implications for clinical 72 management of individual patients and for pandemic surveillance (Szemiel et al., 2021) , and is an 73 important goal of clinical laboratory test development (Kumar et al., 2021a) . Hence, we moved from 74in vitro evidence to investigate the global spread of such mutations of concern. 75 Methods

On November 24, 2021, we searched PubMed (which also indexes the medRxiv and bioRxiv preprint 77 servers) for in vitro studies showing remdesivir resistance and identified mutations of concern in RdRp 78and other SARS-CoV-2 genes involved in the RNA replication machinery. The following queries were 79 used : "SARS-CoV-2 AND mutation AND remdesivir" and "SARS-CoV-2 AND polymerase AND 80remdesivir". Results were manually filtered for relevance. ). 81 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f The Outbreak.info web portal was then used to assess prevalence of such mutations among the 82 5,212,176 SARS-CoV-2 sequences deposited in GISAID as of November 24, 2021. The function 83"Variants"> "LineageMutations tracker" > "Select my own lineage and/or mutations(s)" was used 84 selecting individual mutations within ORF1B. Frequencies of mutations were reported in Table 1  85 together with the main PANGOLIN lineages where each one had been found. 86Mutations within the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, Nsp12) associated with remdesivir 87 resistance were mapped onto the cryo-EM model of the pre-translocation complex (PDB 7C2K) using 88the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System (Schrödinger, version 2.4.1) 89

Table 1 summarizes mutations in different proteins of the replication machinery that have been 91 associated with remdesivir resistance in vitro. Overall, few articles reported remdesivir resistance in 92 vitro, and a single case report detailed emergence of resistance in vivo. GISAID frequencies for those 93 mutations were exceedingly low. Figure 1 reports the 3D location of mutations within the RdRp 94 associated with remdesivir resistance, mapped onto the cryo-EM model of the pre-translocation 95complex. 96 The ligand binding strategy of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (nsp12) features entry and exit channels for the 101 primer-template complex, NTPs and nascent RNA strand which interact strongly with anionic nucleic 102 acids due to a positive electric potential along these grooves. NTP entry, RNA template entry, and 103primer strand entry channels are defined by K545/R553/R555, motifs F/G, and motif E/thumb 104 subdomains, respectively. These all proceed toward to active site composed of motifs A and C, where 105 residues D760, D761 and D618 form important coordinating interactions with divalent cations. 106Additionally, these residues combine with R555 to stabilize incoming nucleotides or inhibitors. In the 107 complex structure, N691 stabilizes with the RDV ribose group as it would with a natural substrate, 108while the hydrophobic V557 likely stabilizes the base pairing interaction between the RDV adenosine 109 analog and the +1 template strand uridine base (Wang et al., 2020b) . Of these critical residues, V557 110 and R555 have been identified in viral sequencing efforts and their substitutions would likely have 111 deleterious effects on ligand binding and polymerase efficiency (Figure 1 ). 112The pre-insertion form of remdesivir forms hydrogen bonds with the viral RNA template and binds 113 ∼100-fold stronger to S549, R555 and D618 in RdRp than the natural substrate ATP (Zhu et al., 2020) . 114The commonest RdRp mutations (e.g., P323L (Pachetti et al., 2020) ) do not destabilize RdRp, while 115 mutations conferring resistance to remdesivir are rare in circulating lineages. The latter is likely due 116to poor fitness of mutants (Agostini et al., 2018) . 117While treatment with molnupiravir has failed to induce viral-resistance mutations in vitro so far 118 (Agostini et al., 2018; Yoon et al., 2018) , remdesivir-resistant viral populations have been selected in 119vitro by serially passaging SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of the drug (Szemiel et al., 2021) . In vivo 120 emergence of RdRp E802D (a.k.a. E793D), a mutation that causes ∼6-fold increase in remdesivir IC50, 121was reported in single nonresponding immunocompromised patient, but the mutation was unfit when 122 remdesivir was removed, and was cleared after REGN-COV-2 (Gandhi et al., 2021) . 123 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f A former analysis moved from the commonest RdRp mutations to investigating their effect on 124 remdesivir binding. Two potential escape motifs have been identified within RdRp, Nsp12:R467-V493 125and Nsp12:L544-Q570. Mutations within these motifs are predicted to affect proofreading ability and 126binding affinity for the RNA template, respectively (Mari et al., 2021) . In the A97V (a.k.a. A88V) RdRp 127 structure remdesivir forms 5 hydrogen bonds with residues K545, S549, K551, T556, and S682 and this 128was associated with a 20-fold increased resistance to remdesivir; the RdRp P323L (a.k.a. P314L) 129 structure, remdesivir forms hydrogen bonds with T556, S759, T680, S682, and N691, but there is no 130 change in affinity (Mohammad et al., 2021) . P323L mutations reduces accessibility to the 321-327 131 epitope and facilitates immune escape (Mallick Gupta et al., 2021) . 132Our prevalence results are in line with analyses run during the first pandemic wave (Mari et al., 2021), 133 suggesting stable and rare occurrence of such escape mutations, as confirmed in Figure 2 . Low 134 sequence variation in the RNA replication complex was also observed among human and mink SARS-135CoV-2 isolates (Martin et al., 2021) . 136The paucity of remdesivir resistance mutations despite its widespread use contrasts with the rapid 137 emergence of drug resistance to antiviral monotherapy in other RNA viruses such as HIV. This 138 difference could stem from different causes. 139First, it might reflect the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and the logistics of antiviral use in 140 these conditions. In most cases, COVID-19 tends to be a disease where individuals improve or 141 succumb to infection, while HIV infection is chronic. Hence, remdesivir is used in individuals of whom 142 the majority will either improve and clear any emerging resistant virus with their immune response or 143 die thus greatly reducing the likelihood of establishment and spread of resistant viral strains. 144Second, remdesivir is an intravenous drug that is used only in hospital settings where patients are 145 under infectious disease precautions. Hospital use also reduces compliance issues, which are 146 associated with emergence of resistance in HIV. 147Third, remdesivir has been typically administered in-hospital (at a median of 5-7 days since onset of 148 symptoms) after the peak viral loads have been achieved (usually around day 3), so reducing the 149 chances for interfering with RdRp. During the early trials, it was mainly focused in the moderate to 150 severe group of patients and there wasn't a fixed schedule. In the ACTT-1/2 placebo-controlled 151 randomized trials, the duration was 10 days (loading dose of 200 mg at day 1, then 100 mg daily up 152 to day 10) (Beigel et al., 2020; Kalil et al., 2020) , but the GS-US-540-5773 showed noninferiority of an 153 alternative schedule of just 5 days (Goldman et al., 2020) . A single RCT (NCT04501952) has 154 investigated remdesivir usage in outpatients based on a 3-day schedule (200 mg day 1, 100 mg days 155 2-3) (Gottlieb et al., 2021) . 156Fourth, the vast majority of immunocompetent individuals can clear the resistant strain, leaving room 157 for emergence of antiviral resistance in immunosuppressed patients only (Shiraki et al., 2021) . 158Fifth, sampling could have been performed at a time remdesivir has been discontinued, when the 159 resistant sublineage has already succumbed because it was less fit than the susceptible ones. Such 160 phenomenon has been previously reported after treatment failure with sofosbuvir, which similarly 161 targets the NS5B RdRp of HCV (Hayes et al., 2021) .Finally, SARS-CoV-2 sequencing is performed at 162 different frequencies in different regions, and isolates selected for genome sequencing from 163 individuals with COVID-19 could be biased towards representing cases with more severe clinical 164 phenotype. As a result, our analysis provides just an estimate of the real frequency of mutations. 165Furthermore, we note that many SARS-CoV-2 sequences in the database were probably deposited 166 from viruses isolated during initial diagnosis rather that obtained from hospitalized patients. Hence, 167 the database analysis is almost certainly skewed towards viral isolates that were not under remdesivir 168 selection. Consequently, the available genome database may not be fully representative of the SARS-169CoV-2 viral sequences in human populations. Lastly, we note that our analysis focused on known 170 remdesivir resistance mutations, while it is possible that other mutations exist that have not been 171 associated with resistance since clinical isolates are not routinely tested for efficacy against SARS-CoV-172 2. 173 174

The usage of remdesivir in hospitalized COVID19 patients has been suddenly discontinued in many 176countries (e.g., Italy) but not others (e.g., USA) since September 2021, when the WHO NOR-Solidarity 177reported lack of clinical efficacy (2021). Accordingly, the latest revision of WHO guidelines (update 2 178 published 8 December 2021) issued a conditional recommendation against use of remdesivir in 179 hospitalized patients regardless of disease severity (Agarwal et al., 2020) . Nevertheless, earlier 180 (outpatient) usage could restore clinical benefit, and research with oral remdesivir prodrugs continues 181 (e.g. GS-441524 (Cox et al., 2021) ). 182Nevertheless, it has been massively used worldwide for more than a year and a half, representing an 183ideal ground for emergence of viral resistance. Despite such deployment, our study shows that in the 184 real-world remdesivir resistance remains exceedingly rare and stable over time, being associated with 185poor viral fitness. Attention should nevertheless be maintained at high levels for "sublethal 186 mutagenesis" (Sadler et al., 2010) , especially when suboptimal oral doses are used (Nelson and Otto, 187 2021). In case resistance occurs, it can be overcome with increased, nontoxic concentrations of 188 remdesivir (Agostini et al., 2018) , RdRp compounds with increased affinity (e.g., SCHEMBL20144212) 189 (Kumar et al., 2021b) , or alternative targets such as the 3C-like-protease/M pro /Nsp5 inhibitors (e.g. 190 nirmatrelvir/PF-07321332 plus ritonavir (Paxlovid™)). model of the pre-translocation complex (PDB 7C2K) (Wang et al., 2020b) . Nsp12 is comprised of a nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN, 197 residues 60-249) N-terminal domain fused to a right-hand RdRp domain (residues 366-920) through an interface region (residues 250-365) (Gao et al., 2020). 198 The RdRp polymerase domain is highly conserved within the viral polymerase family, consisting of three subdomains: the palm (residues 582-620; 199 colored red), fingers (residues 366-581; 621-679, colored dark blue) and thumb (residues 816-920, colored dark green). The NiRAN domain (yellow) contains 200 a unique beta-hairpin (cyan) which distinguishes this protein fold from the SARS-CoV nsp12 homolog and forms stabilizing interactions with the palm 201subdomain of RdRp domain. The RNA polymerase holoenzyme is composed of nsp12 (RdRP) in complex with two nsp8 cofactors and one copy of nsp7, which 202 are displayed in surface representation and colored teal and orange, respectively. The complex is visualized in a pre-translocation state with template nucleic 203 acid (T33-7) and primer (P10) stalled due to incorporation of remdesivir (RDV) into the RNA polymerization machinery. Template RNA, primer and elongation 204 product are depicted in cartoon representation with an orange backbone and green-blue, yellow-blue, and magenta-blue sticks spanning the base plane, 205respectively. RDV and 3'-guanosine are depicted as in full stick representation to represent the entire molecules, and colored yellow and magenta, 206respectively. The complex was rotated and zoomed in to visualize the active site of the polymerase, with RDV and the 3' guanosine are in the -1 and +1 207 subsites, respectively. Escape mutation positions on nsp12 associated with remdesivir resistance are visualized as white side chain sticks and labeled with 208 coloration according to their subdomain localization.
