At highest occupational risk are healthcare workers, emergency response workers, and workers in social services and the care of older people. Clusters of other occupationally exposed groups have been reported. Outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have occurred in factories operated by the meat and poultry processing industry. In such an environment, crowded living and transport conditions, numerous high-touch areas, and difficulties with workplace physical distancing could result in high risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission. 3 In Italy, according to compensation claims, SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred at the workplace in 19·4% of all cases; 30% of people of working age (15-65 years) became infected in the workplace. 4 Health-care workers have been recognised as the most involved occupational category (29 548 affected individuals as of July 5, 2020, in Italy 5 ), and these individuals' dual role as victims and vectors must be highlighted. It will be important to implement policies that adequately factor in the occupational dimension of risk. Specific risk management at workplaces, protection of vulnerable workers, and the develop ment of an occupational epidemiological surveillance system has to be considered as a priority in anti-COVID-19 strategies and in the management of vaccination policies.We declare no competing interests.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).
