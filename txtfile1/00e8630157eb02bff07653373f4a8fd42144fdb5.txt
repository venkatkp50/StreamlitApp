Clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are heterogeneous, with a significant 60 proportion of people experiencing asymptomatic or mild infections that do not require hospitalization. 61 In severe cases, patients develop coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that may progress to acute 62 respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is frequently accompanied by a myriad of inflammatory 63 indicators [1]. Mounting evidence points to a hyper-reactive and dysregulated inflammatory response 64 characterized by overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (cytokine storm) and severe Modelling the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and the impact of delayed IFN on infection 107 dynamics 108 To study the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the development of COVID-19, we 109 constructed a computational biology model of host-pathogen interactions (Eqs. S1-S22, with variables 110 and parameters summarized in Table S1 and schematic in Figure 1) .

Tissue-resident macrophages ( !# ) also become inflammatory macrophages through interaction with dead and 136 infected cells. Dead cells are cleared up by inflammatory macrophages and also cause their death. B) Type I IFN 137is produced by infected cells, inflammatory macrophages and monocytes. G-CSF is produced solely by 138 monocytes and GM-CSF is produced by monocytes and macrophages. IL-6 is produced by monocytes, 139inflammatory macrophages and infected cells. C) Cytokine receptor binding, internalization and unbinding 140kinetics considered for each cell-cytokine interaction. 141Because the model has several parameters that are undetermined biologically and insufficient 142 data exists to confidently estimate their values, we used a stepwise approach to parameter estimation 143 (see Materials and Methods and Figures S1-S5) . We first confirmed that we could recapitulate early (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The resulting model 147 dynamics were in good agreement to these early infection data (Figure 2) measuring the viral load in macaques after challenge with SARS-CoV-2 (Table S1) . 157We then isolated the IFN dynamics to assess clinical and experimental findings suggesting that 158 delaying IFN results in more severe presentations in highly pathogenic coronavirus infections including 159 SARS-CoV-2 [13, 14, 22]. Using the parameters obtained from the 'viral model' (Eqs. 6-9; Table S1), 160 we then simulated the impact of IFN with the 'IFN model' (Eqs. 10-16 and Figure 3A ). We examined 161 the predicted dynamics in response to delayed IFN by simulating with and without a fixed delay for 162 IFN production from infected cells. Our results suggest that delaying type I IFN production by 5 days 163 yields a 10-fold increase in tissue damage with only 20% of the lung tissue remaining on day 2 ( Figure   164 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Immunologic determinants of mild and severe disease 175 Next, to establish the mechanisms that differentiate mild versus severe disease, we simulated 176 the full model (Eqs. S1-S22) using two different parameter sets. Mild disease dynamics were recreated 177 using the estimated parameter values (Table S1) with the virus decay rate ( # ) and the infected cell 178 death rate ( $ ) recalculated to ensure that the maximum death rate of the virus and infected cells did not 179 exceed the value obtained from the reduced viral dynamics model fit (Figure 2) . Simulating mild 180 disease, we predicted that all cell populations and cytokines rapidly return to homeostasis, with the 181 immune response effectively clearing virus within 10 days (Figure 4 and Figure S7 ). 182 Because severe SARS-Cov-2 infection results in lower levels of IFN [42] and increased monocytes 183 [43], we recapitulated severe disease by modulating model parameters relating to these processes, i.e., 184 the rates of IFN production from infected cells and macrophages were decreased, and the rate of 185 monocyte recruitment from the bone marrow by infected cells was increased. With these changes, the 186 model predicted a dramatic shift in disease response that was characterized by a cytokine storm 187 (elevated IL-6, GM-CSF and G-CSF), high ratios of innate to adaptive immune cells, and a marked CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license available under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Interestingly, inflammation remained high in the severe disease scenario despite the virus being 206 cleared slightly faster (~1 day) than in the case of mild disease ( Figure 4A) . Further, the peak of 207 inflammatory macrophages increased from ~10 % cells/ml to ~10 ) cells/ml in severe scenarios 208 compared to mild scenarios ( Figure 4B) .

Macrophages, CD8 + T cells, IFN and IL-6 regulates response to SARS-CoV-2 infection

Predictions were then compared 231 to baseline considering: Maximum viral load (max( )), maximum concentration of dead cells (max( )), 232 minimum uninfected live cells (min(S+R)), maximum concentration of inflammatory macrophages (max( !" )), 233 maximum number of CD8 + T cells (max( )), maximum concentration of IL-6 (max( ) )), maximum 234 concentration of type I IFN (max( ) )), the total exposure to type I IFN ( ) exposure), the number of days 235 damaged tissue was >80% (time ( + )/ *+, ), and the day type I IFN reached its maximum (day max( ) )).

In 251 addition, we designated patient-specific parameters accounting for alternate pathways through which (Figure 7) . 260 The resulting cohort dynamics were within ranges for IFN and IL-6 measurements in asymptomatic to Table 1 Virtual patient-specific parameter values.

Despite this, patients with moderate inflammation exhibited increased disease markers 285 including delayed IFN peaks and lower CD8 + T cells, compared to patients with mild inflammation 286 (Ψ ≤ 3).

287

A distinct jump in the timing of the IFN peak in the virtual cohort (p < 1 × 10 67 ) was 288 correlated with inflammation, as patients with low inflammation (Ψ ≤ 3) had peaks at day 2 compared 289 to day 6 in patients with higher inflammation (Ψ>3). Grouping virtual individuals by their time to IFN 290 peak suggests that those with IFN peaks after day 3 of infection also had fewer macrophages (p< 291 1 × 10 67 ) and larger numbers of CD8 + T cells (p < 1 × 10 67 ). Overall, delays in IFN peak did not 292 cause significant changes to viral load but were sufficient to cause major tissue damage (100x 293 reduction in viable tissue remaining) and over-heightened immune responses (4x increase in maximum 294 IL-6 and GM-CSF concentrations). 295 We found a positive correlation (R= 0.67, p= 1.58 × 10 6' ) between the time to peak IFN 296 concentration for each patient against their IFN production rate from infected cells ( Figure 6B ). 297 Interestingly, the time to peak IFN for each patient was also strongly related to their rate of IL-6-298 stimulated monocyte differentiation into macrophages. Low IFN production rates were predominately 299 responsible for significantly delayed IFN peaks over 6 days after infection, whereas IFN peaks within 3 300 days of infection were largely caused by lower rates of monocyte to macrophage differentiation.

The data-driven mechanistic mathematical model and virtual patient cohort developed 322 here identified important immunological drivers of COVID-19. In particular, to recreate severe 323 dynamics, it was sufficient to vary only two processes in the model: the rates of type I IFN production 324 from infected cells and macrophages, and the rate of monocyte recruitment by infected cells. This 325 suggests that the distinction between severe and mild disease may be driven by a limited set of causal 326 regulators. The effect on IFN production may be further exacerbated by autoimmunity against type I 327 IFNs, which has been shown to correlate to life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia in 2.6% of women 328 and 12.5% of men [18] . 329 Our results show that delaying type I IFN production is sufficient to cause major tissue damage (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.
