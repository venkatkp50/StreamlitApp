FIGURE S1: Trends in Social Distancing and COVID-19 Infections

Notes: This figure shows trends in social distancing compared to new COVID-19 deaths and cases per million using a 7-day moving average weighted by county population. The social distancing index is constructed as the average of the percentage reduction in time outside home and percentage reduction in exposure to others at commercial venues compared to January-February 2020. See main text for details. Notes: These maps show the geographical variation in COVID-19 infections and social distancing as of January 29, 2021. The social distancing index is constructed as the average of the percentage reduction in time outside home and percentage reduction in exposure to others at commercial venues compared to January-February 2020. Panel D shows the standard deviation in social distancing index between January 21 and January 29, 2021. The social distancing index is measured for the 2,018 counties that were the residential county of at least 1,000 sampled devices on every day from January 6 to 12, 2020, to ensure a sufficiently large device sample for each county. These 2,018 counties account for 94% of the U.S. population in 2019. Maps are created using the maptile command on Stata, which is in the public domain.

FIGURE S3: Trends in Social Distancing

Notes: This figures show the raw trends and 7-day moving average of the social distancing index and its two sub-indices weighted by county population. The social distancing index is constructed as the average of the percentage reduction in time outside home (Mobility and Engagement index MEI) and percentage reduction in exposure to others at commercial venues (Device Exposure index DEX) compared to January-February 2020 using a principal component analysis. Google mobility is a measure of the percentage reduction in the number of visitors and time spent in outside places compared to the median value from the 5-week period Jan 3 -Feb 6, 2020. See main text for details. Notes: These maps show the geographical variation in social distancing for the two sub-indices of social distancing as of January 29, 2021. The social distancing (DEX) measures the percentage reduction in exposure to others compared to January-February 2020. Social distancing (MEI) measures the percentage reduction in time outside home compared to January-February 2020. Our main measure of social distancing, the social distancing index, combines these indices using a principal component analysis. Panels C and D shows the standard deviation in social distancing between January 21 and January 29, 2021. DEX is measured for the 2,018 counties that were the residential county of at least 1,000 sampled devices on every day from January 6 to 12, 2020, to ensure a sufficiently large device sample for each county. These 2,018 counties account for 94% of the U.S. population in 2019. Maps are created using the maptile command on Stata, which is in the public domain. Notes: Standard errors clustered at the county level are in parentheses. Significance levels: * 10%, ** 5%, *** 1%. Social distancing (DEX) measures the percentage reduction in exposure to others compared to January-February 2020.. See main text for more details. Unit of observation: county-day. Sample period: January 21, 2020 -January 29, 2021. Outbreak time is measured as the time since the first 3 reported COVID-19 deaths in the county. Deaths and cases due to COVID-19 are measured using a moving average over the last 7 days. Notes: Standard errors clustered at the county level are in parentheses. Significance levels: * 10%, ** 5%, *** 1%. Social distancing (MEI) measures the percentage reduction in time outside home compared to January-February 2020. See main text for more details. Unit of observation: county-day. Sample period: January 21, 2020 -January 29, 2021. Outbreak time is measured as the time since the first 3 reported COVID-19 deaths in the county. Deaths and cases due to COVID-19 are measured using a moving average over the last 7 days. Rupasingha, Goetz and Freshwater (2006) which uses a principal component analysis to include four social capital factors: (1) The aggregate of various civic, religious, business, labor, political associations in the county divided by population per 1000;(2) Voter turnout in the 2012 election; (3) Census response rate; (4) Number of non-profit organizations excluding those with an international approach. Voter participation is a measure of civic capital as used in Barrios et al. (2020) and is the average voter participation in counties at presidential elections between 2004 and 2016. The social distancing index measures the average percentage reduction in time outside home and exposure to others at commercial venues compared to January-February 2020. See main text for more details. Unit of observation: county-day. Sample period: January 21, 2020 -January 29, 2021. Outbreak time is measured as the time since the first 3 reported COVID-19 deaths in the county. Deaths and cases due to COVID-19 are measured using a moving average over the last 7 days.
