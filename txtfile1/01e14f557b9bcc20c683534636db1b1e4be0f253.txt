INTRODUCTION

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) was first detected in late 2019 1 in Wuhan (Hubei Province, People's Republic of China) and has since spread globally with 228 million confirmed cases and 4.69 million deaths as of September 2021. 2 Infection fatality rates are disproportionately high in aged individuals and individuals with comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, obesity and immunosuppression. [3] [4] [5] [6] The recent rapid spike in cases during the second and third waves of infection has been attributed to emerging variants of concern (VOCs) with reported increased transmissibility of infection associated with changes across the viral genome, in particular the spike protein. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Although initial counter measures such as social distancing, masks and travel restrictions have played a major role in suppressing the spread, vaccines continue to be the most effective means to control severe illness and will play a major role in ending the enormous humanitarian and socioeconomic impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.Currently, seven vaccines have been granted Emergency Use Listing by the World Health Organization, with a further 112 in clinical development and 185 in preclinical development using a wide array of technologies including nucleic acid-based vaccines, 12, 13 replicating and nonreplicating viral vectored vaccines, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] inactivated viruses 19, 20 and protein subunit vaccines. 21 As a consequence of the unprecedented speed by which frontrunner vaccines were developed, there remains knowledge gaps in vaccine-mediated protection such as duration of protection, induction and relative importance of cell-mediated immunity, cross-protection against other coronaviruses and control of viral shedding and transmission. In addition, vaccines must meet the needs for rapid and successful deployment within the context of population-scale vaccination programs, with specific considerations given to large-scale manufacturability and distribution logistics. This highlights the need for continued COVID-19 vaccine development strategies using novel technologies that can build upon the successes of the frontrunner vaccines to provide robust, durable and broadly protective efficacy against variants as well as continue to address key logistical challenges.The Sementis Copenhagen Vector (SCV) is a rationally designed, replication-defective viral vector technology based on the Copenhagen strain of vaccinia virus (VACV). Uniquely for a VACV-based vector, it has also been paired with a proprietary manufacturing cell line (MCL) to generate a platform system that can facilitate large-scale and tractable manufacturability of all SCVbased vaccines. 22 The SCV was generated by the targeted deletion of an essential viral assembly gene (D13L) 23, 24 to prevent viral replication while retaining the powerful immunogenicity and large payload capacity of the parental virus. With sites B7R/B8R, C3L, A39R and A41L designated as antigen-insertion sites, it is also an ideal vector technology for multiantigen and multipathogen vaccines, such as the single-vectored dual chikungunya/ Zika virus vaccine. 25 Systems vaccinology studies have demonstrated a localized type 1 T helper signature, 26 with advanced preclinical studies showing a fully attenuated and safe vaccine capable of inducing robust and longlived antigen-specific antibody and CD8 T-cell responses equivalent to those elicited by replication competent VACV. 22 Efficacy of SCV vaccines has also been established in mouse and nonhuman primate challenge models of chikungunya and Zika virus infection. 22, 25, 27 In this study, a first-generation SCV COVID-19 vaccine encoding the full-length, native spike glycoprotein (SCV-S) was constructed, with expression and cell surface anchorage of the spike protein in host cells confirmed. Detailed immunological analyses of vaccine-mediated immune responses demonstrated robust and long-lived spikespecific CD8 T-cell and neutralizing antibody responses in young and middle-aged mice, including inbred and outbred strains. Following a second booster dose, circulating neutralizing antibody levels were sustained without any discernible decay over a 9-month period. Assessment of long-lived CD8 T-cell and antibody-secreting cell compartments confirmed induction of durable spikespecific immune memory following vaccination. Therefore, this study presents evidence that SCV-based COVID-19 vaccines can mediate robust and durable serological and cellular priming which supports progression toward efficacy studies of second-generation vaccine candidates incorporating additional SARS-CoV-2 antigens, to build synergistic layers of additional protection.

Construction and characterization of an SCV expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein

The proprietary SCV vaccine platform technology comprises (1) a VACV-based vector that is unable to produce infectious progeny through targeted deletion of an essential viral assembly protein (D13), which maintains amplification of the viral genome and late gene expression of introduced vaccine antigens for immune stimulation. This is combined with (2) an MCL based on Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that constitutively express D13, for virion assembly, and CP77, an essential VACV host-range protein for CHO cells that provides replication capability for SCV vaccine production in suspension cultures using established commercial manufacturing technologies and facilities (Figure 1a ).To generate a spike encoding SCV vaccine (SCV-S), the unmodified full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike gene from the original Wuhan isolate-1 under the control of a synthetic VACV early/late promoter 28 was introduced by homologous recombination to replace the A41L open reading frame in SCV (Figure 1b) . PCR analysis confirmed site-specific insertion of the heterologous SARS-CoV-2 spike sequence into SCV and absence of D13L (Figure 1c ). Authentic expression of the spike protein was confirmed by infecting nonpermissive human 143B cells 22 with SCV-S or parent control vector (SCV containing no vaccine antigen) and detection of S1 production by immunoblot analysis (Figure 1d and Supplementary figure 1), as well as surface expression of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in infected cells by flow cytometric analysis ( Figure 1e ).The conversion of research-grade vaccine stock to cGMP-compliant master virus seed (MVS) and working virus seed stocks requires several passages, followed by subsequent expansion during manufacturing for largescale SCV vaccine production. Therefore, the genetic stability of SCV-S was evaluated by serial passaging of the MVS up to 10 times (P10), which extends at least fivefold beyond the expected expansion requirement to reach commercial-scale vaccine batch production. Genetic integrity and sequence authenticity were confirmed by next-generation sequencing of MVS and P10 stocks (Supplementary figure 2) . Immunostaining of MVS and P10 infected cell monolayers using anti-RBD antibody confirmed spike protein expression in all foci of viral infection ( Figure 1f) , with similar viral titer amplification ratios observed up to 72 h after infection ( Figure 1g ).

SCV-S vaccination stimulates rapid and functional cellmediated immunity

The capacity of SCV-S to induce an early spike-specific cellular immune response was evaluated in C57BL/6J mice. One week after vaccination, splenocytes were stimulated with overlapping peptide pools spanning the S1 and S2 subunits of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and antigen-specific T-cell responses evaluated by interferon-c (IFNc) ELISPOT. Vaccination with SCV-S induced significant S1-and S2-specific IFNc spot-forming units (SFUs) compared with mice vaccinated with control vector (Figure 2a) . Consistent with the ELISPOT results, significantly elevated populations of S1-and S2specific IFNc-producing CD8 + T cells were detected in Figure 1 . Vaccine construction and in vitro characterization. (a) Targeted deletion of D13L in SCV-S renders the viral vector unable to generate viral progeny by preventing virion assembly but allows for amplification of the SCV-S genome and late gene expression for production of spike protein to drive the vaccine-specific immune response (top panel). In trans provision of D13 and expression of the host range protein CP77 in the CHO-based manufacturing cell line allow for cell infection and rescue of virion assembly, allowing production of progeny for vaccine manufacture (bottom panel). (b) Schematic representation of SCV-S construction showing the D13L deletion and A41L substitution sites, with site-specific primers and the expected band size indicated. (c) Viral DNA from VACV and SCV-S was used for PCR analysis using the site-specific primers shown in b to confirm the deletion of D13L and insertion of spike. (d) Immunoblot analysis of spike antigen expression in SCV-S and control vector-infected 143B cells using an anti-S1 antibody. SCV-S-vaccinated mice compared with controls by intracellular cytokine staining (Figure 2b ).Effector CD8 T cells with cytotoxic potential produce granzyme B, a serine protease that is capable of mediating target cell lysis, 29 and a significant population of CD8 + T cells were shown to express granzyme B in response to SCV-S vaccination (Figure 2c ). To confirm cytotoxic activity, day 7 splenocytes were incubated with radiolabeled target cells pulsed with either S1 N-terminal domain (S1-NTD)-, RBD-or S2-specific peptide pools (Supplementary table 1 ). Significant cytolytic activity was detected against S1-NTD and RBD target cells (Figure 2d and Supplementary figure 3) . The absence of functional activity against the S2 subunit suggested that the SCV-S vaccine primarily triggers an S1-specific cytotoxic T-cell profile. Together, these results indicated that the SCV-S vaccine induced an early expansion of spike-specific effector CD8 T cells with potential to reduce viral burden before the humoral arm of the immune response can be well established.

Data in a, b, e and f are representative of a second independent experiment with similar results which was conducted in female mice (n = 6/group) to generate the data in d.

Previous studies have demonstrated that CD8 T cells that produce multiple cytokines have enhanced effector functions and support maturation of an antigen-specific memory T-cell population. 30, 31 Therefore, S1-and S2specific cytokine producing CD8 + T cells were profiled into seven distinct populations based on the production of IFNc, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-2 (IL-2) and their combinations (Supplementary figure 4) . Polyfunctional IFNc + TNF + cells dominated the responding S1-and S2-specific T-cell population, followed by IFNc + TNF + IL-2 + (triple cytokine producing) and single IFNc + producing cell population ( Figure 2e ). Furthermore, significant numbers of S1-and S2-specific triple cytokine-producing CD8 + T cells (Figure 2f ), produced more cytokines on a per-cell basis than double and single cytokine-producing CD8 + T cells (Supplementary figure 5) .

SCV-S vaccination induces spike-specific binding and neutralizing antibody responses

Immunogenicity of SCV-S was evaluated in C57BL/6J mice, with kinetics of spike-binding antibody responses assessed up to day 28 after vaccination. S1 and S2 immunoglobulin M (IgM)-binding titers peaked at day 7 after vaccination and then returned to baseline levels by day 20 (Figure 3a ; top panels). Class-switched S1 IgGbinding titers were detected in all mice by day 9 after vaccination, with the appearance of S2 IgG-binding antibodies delayed to days 15-19 after vaccination ( Figure 3a , lower panels). The World Health Organization target product profile for COVID-19 vaccines 32 and current understandings in the field indicate that a type 1 T helper-biased humoral and cellular immune responses is required to prevent vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease. 33, 34 Subclass profiling of day 28 postvaccination serum samples revealed a strong IgG2c response with an associated IgG2c-to-IgG1 ratio of >1 confirming a type 1 T helper-biased spike-specific antibody response ( Figure 3b and Supplementary figure 6 ).Outbred strains of mice are more representative of the genetic variability in the general human population and therefore the dominant S1-binding antibody responses in inbred and outbred strains of mice were compared at day 21 after vaccination. S1 IgG-binding titers were comparable between the two strains of mice, were significantly higher than the controls and translated into significant levels of neutralizing activity (Figure 3c ).To understand the long-term kinetics of the spikespecific antibody response, serum samples from outbred ARC(s) mice were evaluated up to 6 months after vaccination. S1-binding titers remained significantly elevated compared with na€ ıve mice at all timepoints tested, although a trend in reduced titer was observed from 3 months. Significant neutralizing activity was also maintained, albeit with a small steady decline after 3 months (Figure 3d) . A similar trend was observed in C57BL/6J mice, with significant S1-specific antibodybinding titers and neutralizing activity maintained up to 12 weeks after vaccination, although neutralization activity had halved between 3 and 12 weeks (Supplementary figure 7) . Therefore, to stabilize the waning antibody responses, a 4-week homologous prime/boost vaccination strategy was assessed in C57BL/6J mice. At 3 weeks after the boost, a significant increase in both S1 IgG-binding titers and neutralizing activity was detected in the prime-boost cohort compared with single-dose and control vectorvaccinated mice (Figure 3e) . A positive correlation between the S1-specific IgG-binding titers and neutralization activity was confirmed (Supplementary figure 8) .Given the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants that can exhibit increased replicative and transmission fitness, the SCV-S vaccine-generated neutralization antibody response was assessed against the recognized alpha and beta VOCs. First, the capacity to block the interaction between viral RBD and the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor was assayed using the RBD protein from the original Wuhan isolate-1, N501Y alpha VOC or the E484K, K417N and N501Y beta VOC. All serum samples inhibited the binding between the ACE2 receptor and the RBD from the original Wuhan isolate-1, with a 1.1-and 2.1-fold reduction in inhibition detected for the alpha and beta VOCs ( Figure 3f ). Next, using SARS-CoV-2pseudotyped lentiviruses containing the spike sequence of either the Wuhan isolate-1, alpha or beta VOCs, the effect of mutations on the serum neutralizing capacity was examined. A similar result, with a significant 3.2and 4.1-fold reduction in the 80% inhibitory concentration, was noted for the alpha and beta VOCs compared with the original Wuhan isolate-1 ( Figure 3g ).The persistence of neutralizing antibody responses is important in all populations, including the aging population. Therefore, the durability of the SCV-S induced neutralizing activity was evaluated in both young (6-8-week old) and middle-aged (9-10-month old) mice. S1-binding (Supplementary figure 9) and functional neutralizing antibodies ( Figure 3h ) were maintained without any significant decrease in titer up to the termination of the study at 3 months after boost vaccination. Importantly, no significant differences were detected in the neutralizing capacity between the young and middle-aged mice. In summary, these results indicate that prime-boost vaccination with SCV-S induces a robust and durable spike-specific antibody response with neutralizing capacity against the original Wuhan isolate-1, and both alpha and beta VOCs.

Prime-boost vaccination with SCV-S enhances antigenspecific memory T-cell responses

To examine SCV-S-induced cellular immune responses, C57BL/6J mice were immunized in a single dose (day 0) or prime-boost (day 0 and 28) vaccination protocol, with spike-specific memory CD8 + T-cell populations studied 3 months later. Mice vaccinated with control vector in a prime-boost strategy were used as appropriate controls. Following a single dose of the vaccine, S1-NTD-specific IFNc + SFU were detected above the background determined by control vector-vaccinated mice; however, a . Spike-specific antibody and SARS-CoV-2 neutralization responses following SCV-S vaccination. (a) S1 and S2 subunit endpoint IgM and IgG ELISA titers determined from serum of female C57BL/6J mice (n = 3) at the indicated times after a single vaccination with 10 7 PFU of SCV-S, with (b) ratio of S1-and S2-specific IgG2c to IgG1 endpoint ELISA titers determined 28 days after vaccination. (c) S1 IgG ELISA binding titers (left panel) and cPass neutralization titers (right panel) in outbred ARC(s) and inbred C57BL/6J female mice (n = 5) 21 days after a single vaccination with 10 7 PFU of SCV-S or vector control, with (d) durability of response in the outbred cohort shown by S1-specific endpoint IgG ELISA titers (left panel) and neutralization titers (right panel) at the indicated times. (e) S1-specific IgG ELISA (left panel) and neutralization titers (right panel) 50 days after a single-dose (day 0) or prime-boost (day 0 and 28) vaccination of female C57BL/6J mice (n = 5) with 10 7 PFU SCV-S or control vector, with (f) neutralizing activity in ACE2 and RBD blocking ELISA, and (g) neutralizing activity (IC 80 titers) against lenti-SARS-CoV-2-S pseudoviruses bearing spike protein from the Wuhan reference strain, the alpha or beta variant, shown for prime-boost samples. (h) Neutralization titers in young (6-8 weeks old; n = 5) and middle-aged (9-10 months old; n = 10) C57BL/6J mice at the indicated times after prime-boost vaccination with 10 7 PFU SCV-S. Results shown are representative of four independent experiments (indicated above) with binding and neutralizing antibody levels comparable at similar doses and time points across all experiments. Symbols represent individual mice and bars show the mean AE s.e.m. from independent experiments. Data were log transformed and statistical significance determined using Brown-Forsythe and Welch ANOVA with Dunnett T3 multiple comparison test. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; *** P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001.

(Figure 4a ). This correlated with an increased frequency of IFNc + -producing CD8 + T cells and absolute numbers of polyfunctional IFNc + TNF + IL-2 + -expressing CD8 + T cells, with the prime-boost regimen significantly elevating the response over that detected in single dose and control-vaccinated mice (Figure 4b) . A similar significant increase in RBD-specific and S2-specific IFNc + SFU and IFNc-expressing and polyfunctional CD8 + T cells was noted in the primeboost-vaccinated mice compared with the single dose and control-vaccinated mice; however, a single dose also induced a significant population of RBD-specific and S2specific IFNc + CD8 + T cells and triple cytokineproducing cells (Figure 4c-f) .Analysis of the total spike-specific CD8 + T-cell IFNc + responses revealed an immunodominance of RBD-specific responses, with about 65% of the total spike-specific responses targeting the RBD region of the spike protein.Further cytokine profiling of this RBD-specific CD8 + Tcell population revealed that the prime-boost vaccination regimen significantly increased the mean frequency of multifunctional T cells from 32% with a single dose to 80% with a prime boost. This consisted of an average 3.3-fold increase in double-positive, and 1.7-fold increase in triple-cytokine positive cells compared with singledose-vaccinated mice (Figure 4g, h) . Similar trends were observed in middle-aged mice, with prime-boost vaccination inducing significantly higher S1-NTD-, RBDand S2-specific IFNc-producing cells than in single-dose and control-vaccinated mice (Supplementary figure 10) .Vector-specific memory T-cell responses were also assessed. As expected, prime-boost SCV-S and control vector-vaccinated mice had significantly higher levels of vector-specific IFNc SFU, IFNc + CD8 + T cells and triple cytokine-positive cells, than single-dose-vaccinated mice (Supplementary figure 11) . Overall, prime-boost vaccination significantly increased the CD8 + short-lived effector T-cell and long-lived effector memory T-cell populations in general. No significant changes were observed in the central memory T-cell compartment (Supplementary figure 12) . Altogether, these results confirm that prime-boost vaccination with SCV-S enhances the spike-specific memory CD8 + T-cell response in both young and middle-aged populations of mice.Pre-existing vector immunity constrains the magnitude of cellular immune responses, but has no impact on spike-specific humoral immune responsesThe presence of VACV-specific memory immune responses, particularly in a small cohort of the aged population that had previously received a smallpox vaccination, may impact on the induction of vaccine antigen-specific cellular and humoral immune responses from recombinant SCV vaccines. A mouse model of robust pre-existing vector immunity was established to study its impact on spike-specific immune responses following vaccination with SCV-S. Mice were administered a single dose of replicative VACV, with presence of vector-specific antibody responses confirmed 6 weeks later (Figure 5a ). After 8 weeks, mice were vaccinated with SCV-S vaccine in a 4-week prime-boost strategy, and the magnitude and quality of spike-specific antibody and T-cell responses were evaluated. Na€ ıve mice were used as controls for vectorspecific immune responses and mice vaccinated with control vector were used as controls for antigen-specific responses. Two weeks after the SCV-S booster dose administration, no significant differences in S1-and S2specific IgG-binding titers between cohorts with (+) or without (À) pre-existing immunity were observed (Figure 5b) . Consistent with the binding titers, SARS-CoV-2 neutralization activity was comparable between the two groups of mice ( Figure 5c ). Importantly, neutralizing activity was not impacted by pre-existing immunity even at 3 months after SCV-S vaccination (Figure 5d) .Next, the impact of pre-existing immunity on spikespecific memory CD8 T-cell responses at 3 months after SCV-S vaccination was evaluated in the spleen using peptide pools specific to S1-NTD, RBD and S2 regions of the spike protein. As anticipated, irrespective of the preexisting immunity status, SCV-S-vaccinated mice had significantly higher S1-NTD-, RBD-and S2-specific IFNc + SFU than control-vaccinated mice (Figure 5e ). However, approximately 10-15-fold lower S1-NTD-and RBD-specific T-cell responses were noted in mice with pre-existing VACV memory responses than in VACV na€ ıve mice, suggesting that the magnitude of the spike-specific T-cell responses was impacted on by pre-existing vector immunity. Assessment of the IFNc + CD8 + T-cell population confirmed a 20-fold increase in IFNc expression in response to SCV-S primeboost vaccination in VACV na€ ıve mice compared with VACV-experienced cohorts (Figure 5f ).Further analysis of the dominant RBD-specific CD8 + T-cell responses revealed a higher proportion of RBDspecific multifunctional T cells in VACV na€ ıve mice than in VACV-experienced mice, with a specific increase in IFNc + cells co-expressing TNF (Figure 5g ). Despite a lower proportion of multifunctional T cells within the cytokine-producing CD8 + T cells, significant numbers of RBD-specific triple cytokine-positive cells in VACVexperienced mice could still be detected compared with control-vaccinated mice (Figure 5h ). Together, this indicated that pre-existing vector immunity had no significant effect on the humoral immune response, and while this significantly reduced the magnitude of the spike-specific memory CD8 + T-cell response, vaccination with SCV-S could still, however, induce significant spikespecific cellular responses.Middle-aged mice demonstrate long-lived and robust spike-specific cellular and humoral immune responses following SCV-S vaccination Long-lived immunological memory forms the basis of robust prevention of disease following vaccination. Previous studies have demonstrated that impaired immune responses in older individuals can be associated with decreased immunological memory after vaccination. 35, 36 Therefore, the ability of SCV-S to establish a long-lived spike-specific immune response was investigated. Young and middle-aged C57BL/6J mice were vaccinated in a 4week prime-boost regimen, and spike-specific immune responses were analyzed 9 months after vaccination. Significant S1-binding IgG titers were observed in both young and middle-aged mice compared with controlvaccinated mice, with no statistical difference observed between the groups (Figure 6a, left panel) . Surprisingly, S2-binding titers were detected only in four out of five middle-aged mice, and while the mean S2 IgG-binding titers in the middle-aged mice were higher than the control-vaccinated mice, it was not statistically different. The young mice, by contrast, had significant S2 IgGbinding titers compared with the control-vaccinated mice (Figure 6a ; right panel). Retrospective analysis of the S2binding titers in the young and middle-aged mice during the vaccination time course revealed that the levels were comparable at day 21 after prime; however, no further increase in the S2-binding titers in middle-aged mice followed the booster dose. In comparison, an approximate 10-fold increase in the S2-binding titers were detected in young mice after boost vaccination (Supplementary figure 13 ). Despite these differences in the S2-binding titers, the neutralization activity was comparable between the young and middle-aged mice at 9 months (Figure 6b ). Persistent antigen-specific antibody levels in the serum are maintained by long-lived antibody-secreting cells that reside in the bone marrow. 37, 38 Both the young and middle-aged mice demonstrated significant numbers of S1specific antibody-secreting cells compared with the control-vaccinated mice, with the populations comparable between the two groups ( Figure 6c) .Consistent with the antibody responses, spike-specific Tcell responses were maintained in both young and middleaged mice at 9 months after vaccination. Significant numbers of S1-NTD- (Figure 6d ), RBD-( Figure 6e ) and S2- (Figure 6f ) specific IFNc + SFU and IFNc + CD8 + T cells were detected in both the young and middle-aged mice compared with the control-vaccinated mice, with no statistical difference noted between the two groups. The proportions of multifunctional T cells within the cytokineproducing CD8 + T-cell population across all three regions of the spike protein were also comparable (Supplementary figure 14) . Triple cytokine-producing CD8 + T cells that have enhanced cytokine and memory potential were also detected in significant numbers in all groups except S2targeting triple cytokine-producing CD8 + T cells, which suggested that S1-specific polyfunctional effector cellular responses dominate the memory compartment following SCV-S vaccination. In summary, these results indicate that SCV-S vaccination induces a long-lived humoral and cellular immunity, with similar magnitude and quality of immune responses in both young and middle-aged mice, demonstrating broad applicability of SCV-S.

DISCUSSION

Vaccine development programs that enhance existing vaccine technologies and advance development of novel vaccine platforms are critical in the current race to curb SARS-CoV-2 evolution and control the COVID-19 pandemic. Complementary and synergistic vaccination strategies and cohort-specific vaccination approaches are rapidly gaining acceptance, because of a lack of effective antiviral therapies, a broad range of vulnerable populations and the intrinsic manufacturing challenges associated with global vaccination campaigns. In the current stage of the pandemic, a potential vaccine candidate should satisfy one or more of the following criteria: induce a broad and robust humoral and cellular immune response against the dominant circulating variants, establish long-lived immune responses that can maintain herd immunity and prevent circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and variants, provide cross-protection against other coronaviruses and have a stream-lined and tractable manufacturing process.The SCV vaccine platform technology builds on the favorable characteristics of the parental VACV vector, namely, long-lasting cellular and humoral immune responses, significant antigen payload capacity and coldchain-independent vaccine distribution capability, and incorporates additional advantages, primarily safety while maintaining immunogenicity. SCV-based vaccines have proven stability at 4°C for 6 months in simple salt-buffered liquid formulations, and at least 1 year in dried formulations (unpublished data), which may address the logistical difficulties associated with vaccine deployment in hard-to-reach and vulnerable communities. Furthermore, the SCV platform addresses the manufacturing challenges associated with the use of primary cells in empirically attenuated VACV-based vaccine production; industrystandard CHO cells were uniquely genetically engineered to allow high-yield production of SCV vaccines. This study describes the immunogenicity of a first-generation SCVmediated COVID-19 vaccine incorporating the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, which mediates viral attachment and entry into host cells. The data presented here show that SCV-S-infected cells produce the spike immunogen that is transported to the cell surface to stimulate antigenspecific immune responses. Importantly, the spike insert was maintained in the viral genome without any loss or changes in transgene sequence or protein expression, thus confirming the genetic stability of the vaccine through several passages, which is an inherent characteristic to support large-scale vaccines manufacturing protocols.Immunogenicity studies in mice confirmed that the vaccine induces spike-specific functional T-cell responses in 1 week, and robust levels of circulating spike-specific antibodies in both inbred and outbred strains of mice, with significant neutralizing activity detected within 2 weeks of vaccination. These functional immune responses satisfy the rapid onset of protection criteria set forth in the COVID-19 vaccine target product profile by the World Health Organization, a promising attribute for a stand-alone vaccine in establishing ring immunity and preventing spread of infection. While a direct comparison of the neutralizing activity with other frontrunner vaccines would be useful, differing protocols and analyses used across diverse vaccine platforms deployed and in development make it virtually impossible to do so. Instead, neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 and the VOCs (alpha and beta) was confirmed by two different methods: (1) using an FDA-approved validation methodology 39 that detects antibodies that block the interaction between RBD (and variants thereof) and the ACE2 cell surface receptor, and (2) a lentiviral-based pseudovirus neutralization assay. Importantly, after two doses the circulating neutralizing antibody responses were maintained long term with minimal contraction, up to 9 months after vaccination, in both young and middle-aged mice. With a clear aim to provide a detailed immunological analysis of the SCV-S vaccine, particularly durability of responses, we used 9-10month-old middle-aged mice that could then be assessed at least 9 months after vaccination (around 18-19 months of age). The sustained circulating antibody levels are encouraging particularly in light of recent studies suggesting a decay in neutralization activity in vaccinated 40 and convalescent patients, 41 and support protective efficacy studies in infectious disease challenge models.The correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 in humans have not been clearly defined. While it is well acknowledged that neutralizing antibodies play a critical role, emerging clinical data suggest that the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses may be an important factor determining COVID-19 severity. 42 Preclinical efficacy studies in mouse models have demonstrated that in the absence of antibodies, T-cell responses can protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection. 43 In addition, recent studies show that the SARS-CoV-2 VOCs can partially escape broadly neutralizing antibody responses but maintain effector and memory T-cell reactivity, 44 further highlighting the complimentary role of T cells in modulating the disease severity for emerging variants. Following vaccination with SCV-S, robust spike-specific polyfunctional CD8 T cells with cytotoxic activity were observed within the first week, which further differentiate to form a memory T-cell pool that can be detected upon secondary stimulation 9 months after vaccination, in both young and middle-aged mice. Notably, spike-specific humoral and cellular immune responses could be detected even in the presence of preexisting vaccine vector immunity.Analysis of the antibody repertoire in SARS-CoV-2recovered individuals revealed the presence of neutralizing antibodies against the S1-NTD and S2 region of the spike protein in addition to anti-RBD antibodies. 45, 46 While the exact role and relative contributions of the non-RBD neutralizing antibodies in SARS-CoV-2 infection remain to be fully addressed, it is intuitive to deduce that broad spike-specific antibody responses spanning mutational hotspots (RBD and S1-NTD) and conserved regions (S2) of the spike region, via a combination of anti-S1 and anti-S2 neutralizing antibodies, will offer improved protective efficacy potential against emerging variants. T-cell epitope analysis in na€ ıve individuals revealed reactivity to SARS-CoV-2, with significant proportion of the epitopes mapped to the non-RBD region of the spike protein, 47 suggesting that T-cell responses against the conserved S1-NTD and S2 regions can offer cross-protection against other betacoronaviruses. Our results demonstrate that SCV-S induces a broad spike-specific antibody and CD8 T-cell Figure 5 . Impact of pre-existing vector immunity on spike-specific antibody and CD8 T-cell responses. Cohorts of C57BL/6J mice containing both genders (n = 5 in total) were vaccinated at day À60 with VACV at 10 5 PFU or diluent only to generate groups with and without pre-existing immunity.

Furthermore, poxvirus-based vectors have a long history as efficient boosters to a wide range of platform technologies such as DNA, 48 protein 49 and viral-vectored platforms. 50 As such, the evidence of serological and cellular priming by the SCV-S vaccine in this study, along with the safety profile of the replication-defective SCV platform, suggests that the vaccine will also be an effective booster to the current vaccines, with potential to enhance spike-specific immune responses. The encouraging immunogenicity profile with a single SARS-CoV-2 antigen also provides impetus to include additional SARS-CoV-2 antigens in second-generation SCV-COVID-19 vaccines, primarily to broaden and strengthen vaccine immunogenicity profiles for enhanced vaccine protective efficacy against current VOCs and new emerging variants as they inevitably become established within the affected global population.
