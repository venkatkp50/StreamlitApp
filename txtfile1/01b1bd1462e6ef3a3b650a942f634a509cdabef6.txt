[5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Most studies report a similar [8, 10, 11, 14, 15] or even lower [9, 13] incidence of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection among HIV-positive compared to HIV-negative groups. However, some studies have compared incidence in PWH to data from the general population [8, 9, 13] , whereas others have compared it to individuals without HIV using population-based surveillance registers [10, 11, 14] . Only one study has compared SARS-CoV-2 incidence in PWH to a group of age-, race-, sexand site-matched HIV-negative people [15] .In the general population, the majority of people with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, with or without confirmation by PCR, develop detectable antibodies against the nucleocapsid (N), spike (S) and receptor binding domain (RBD) protein. [19] [20] [21] N-antibodies are detectable in more than 91% of individuals following a symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. [22, 23] Vaccination with the currently European Medicines Agency-approved vaccines all trigger an immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein but do not elicit N-antibodies. [24] [25] [26] [27] SARS-CoV-2 N-antibodies are thus an appropriate marker to detect past SARS-CoV-2 infection, including infection acquired despite partial or complete vaccination. Several studies found that SARS-CoV-2 N-antibodies remained detectable for at least 8 months after infection, although levels may decline over time. [28, 29] A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 7 SARS-CoV-2 S-and N-antibody titres each correlate with disease severity, titres being higher in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 than in those with asymptomatic or mild symptomatic infection. [21, [29] [30] [31] Moreover, one general population study reported older age and higher BMI to also be associated with higher N-antibody titres. [32] Few studies have addressed the potential impact of HIV on the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. One small cross-sectional study reported no significant difference in SARS-CoV-2 N-antibody titres between 47 PWH and 35 HIV-negative health care workers. [33] Another small study in 28 PWH found no difference in SARS-CoV-2 IgG N-titres between PWH with CD4 cell counts ≥500 or <500 cells/mm 3 . [8] No study has prospectively compared the acquisition of symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 and the antibody response to infection between people with well-controlled HIV and comparable HIV-negative individuals. We therefore conducted a study of this design nested within our ongoing AGEhIV cohort study in Amsterdam.

Study design and participants

The AGEhIV Cohort Study is a prospective observational cohort study assessing the prevalence Amsterdam, resulting in a control group with highly similar socio-demographic and behavioural characteristics. At baseline and every 2 years thereafter, patients undergo standardized screening for age-related comorbidities, and collection of blood, urine and stool for cryopreservation. Details have been described previously. [34] A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 8 In August 2020, following the first SARS-CoV-2 epidemic wave in the Netherlands, all AGEhIV Cohort participants in active follow-up and residing in the Netherlands were asked to participate in a COVID-19 substudy, which includes five planned, six-monthly study visits between September 2020 and October 2022. During each visit, blood is obtained to assess SARS-CoV-2 humoral and cellular immune responses and participants complete a standardized study questionnaire.For the current analysis, data from the first and second six-monthly study visits (September-October 2020 and March-April 2021) were used. These data capture approximately up to 14 months of possible exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in the Netherlands: from February 27, 2020 (the date at which the first case of COVID-19 was identified in the Netherlands) until April 30, 2021 (end of second COVID-19 substudy visit).Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Amsterdam UMC, location AMC and is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01466582).

Participant characteristics

Date of birth, sex at birth and ethnic origin obtained at time of enrolment into the AGEhIV Cohort Study were used for all participants. Other baseline characteristics were obtained from the last available parent cohort study visit prior to February 27, 2020, and included data on number of prevalent co-morbidities, lifestyle (i.e., smoking, alcohol use, recreational drug use, other A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 9 BMI was categorized as underweight (<18.5 kg/m 2 ), normal weight (18.5-24.9), overweight (25.0-29.9) or obese (≥30.0). Undetectable HIV-1 plasma viral load was defined as <50 copies/mL, while viral blips up to 200 copies/mL were also considered as undetectable.

Questionnaire data

At each substudy visit, participants were asked to complete a standardized questionnaire Table 1 ). Reasons for declining participation did not differ between HIV-positive and -negative participants (Supplementary Table 2 ).The characteristics of included participants are shown in Table 1 . The majority were Caucasian males (83.4%) and the median age was 60. were fatigue, cough, rhinorrhoea, muscle ache, headache and fever. There was no significant difference between both groups, except for 'confusion', which was reported more often by HIVpositive participants.Only two participants, both HIV-negative, reported that they had been admitted for >1 day to a general hospital ward with COVID-19 for treatment with supplemental oxygen.

Factors associated with incident SARS-CoV-2 infection

HIV status was not independently associated with incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in both the univariable (Supplementary Table 3 ) and multivariable analysis (Table 3 ). In the univariable analysis, the association with self-reported compliance to social distancing did not reach statistical significance. In the multivariable analysis, incident SARS-CoV-2 infection was significantly associated with younger age and being of African origin, with none of these risk factors showing a statistically significant interaction with HIV status. Table 4 ) and multivariable analysis (Table 4 ). Having experienced fever in the six months prior to the positive SARS-CoV-2 N-antibody test was the only variable significantly associated with a higher N-antibody level in multivariable analysis.A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t

DISCUSSION

During 14 months of possible SARS-CoV-2 exposure, we found no significant difference in the cumulative incidence of infection between HIV-negative participants in our study and those who were HIV-positive and -with few exceptions -were on cART with suppressed viremia and a reasonably high CD4 cell count. Having HIV also did not significantly impact the SARS-CoV-2 Nantibody level, as measured by INgezim® COVID-19 double recognition assay. Only two of our participants, both HIV-negative, had been admitted to the hospital for COVID-19, with neither having progressed to severe disease or death.In our cohort, the cumulative incidence on October 31, 2020 and April 30, 2021 was 6.2% and 12.3%, respectively. This is similar to the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence for those 50 to 70 years old in the general Dutch population, which ranged between 4-6% and 10-15% in September among PWH compared to HIV-negative people. [38] Of note, participants were only matched for age and date of sampling; the two groups were not comparable with regards to sex, ethnic origin and prevalence of comorbidities, which likely affects the observed difference in seroprevalence between the groups. In our study, participants in both groups were highly comparable which might explain why we found no difference between the groups.We found that living with HIV was not independently associated with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We did not find an association between incident SARS-CoV-2 infection and HIVspecific parameters. Of note, almost all HIV-positive participants in our study were virologically suppressed (99.2%), with almost 80% having ≥500 CD4 cells/mm 3 and virtually none had a clinically relevant degree of immunodeficiency. This limits our ability to assess the associations between HIV viral load, CD4 count and acquisition of SARS-CoV-2. However, other studies found no association between HIV viral load or current CD4 cell count and SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. [38, 39] Moreover, most PCR-based prevalence studies also found no association between HIV-specific factors and SARS-CoV-2 infection [11, 13, 15, 16] . One study from Wuhan suggested a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in PWH who reported or were inferred to have had interrupted access to cART during the lockdown in the early stage of the epidemic [8] .Younger age and being of African origin were each associated with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in our analysis, without a significant interaction between these factors and HIV status. These findings corroborate the higher seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in younger adults observed in other studies [38, 40, 41] , and are similar to observations in the general Dutch population [36] . A study among six ethnic groups living in Amsterdam likewise showed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence to be significantly higher in individuals of Ghanaian origin, compared to those of Dutch origin. [42] This increased risk in individuals of African origin might be associated with socio-economic factors, including lower income, being dependent of public A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 16 transport or working in a contact-based profession. Unfortunately, data on such factors were not available for our study.In participants with an incident SARS-CoV-2 infection, N-antibody levels were not significantly different between HIV-positive and -negative participants, similar to what was reported by another study in which HIV-positive participants (with a median age of 52 years) all had undetectable viral load. [33] Moreover, in that study antibody titres were similar in HIV-positive participants with CD4 cell counts ≥500 cells/mm 3 compared to those with <500 cells/mm 3 A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 31 M a n u s c r i p t 32
