Infectivity assay

The HEK293T-ACE2 cells (1×10 4 /100  l/well) were seeded into 96-well cell culture plates in 5% CO2 at 37°C. On the second day, the medium in each well was replaced with 100 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 1×10 4 pseudotyped copies. The medium in each well was then replaced with 100 μl of fresh culture medium at 12 h post-incubation. At 48 and 72 h post-incubation, 100 μl of luciferase substrate buffer (Promega; USA) was added to each well and cell lysates were then transferred to a compatible opaque 96-well plate. Luciferase activity was detected using a Varioskan Lux Luminescence reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific; USA).

Cell-cell fusion assay

The plasmid encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was co-transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing plasmid into HEK293T cells using Lipofectamine 3000 (L30000015; Invitrogen; USA). In addition, the hACE2-expressing plasmid was also transfected into other HEK293T cells. The two groups of cells were mixed at a 1:1 ratio 24 h post-transfection and co-cultured in complete DMEM in 5% CO2 at 37°C. After 24 h of co-culture, the GFP signals were observed under a fluorescence microscope.

Neutralization by pseudotyped viruses

The HEK293T-ACE2 cells (1×10 4 /100  l/well) were seeded into 96-well cell culture plates. Serum was initially diluted with cell culture medium at 1:20 followed by 4-fold dilution. Equivalent pseudoviruses (5×10 3 copies in 50 μl) were mixed with serum dilutions and incubated for 60 min at 37°C. The mixtures were added to infect the HEK293T-ACE2 cells. At 72 h post-infection, luciferase activity was measured to calculate neutralizing titer as a 50% inhibitory dose (ID50).

Immunoblotting

Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (Zeng et al., 2020) . In brief, target cells were lysed in 1% NP40 buffer (Beyotime; China) with protease inhibitor cocktail (MedChemExpress; USA). Proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes using semi-dry transfer at 25 V for 30 min. The membranes were blocked in 5% milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) for 1 h and incubated overnight with mouse monoclonal anti-flag antibody (M220008; Abmart; China) in 5% bovine serum albumin at 4°C. The membranes were then incubated with anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies in 5% milk for 1 h at room termperature and bands were developed using Chemi-Doc XRS imaging (Bio-Rad; USA)

Statistical analysis

GraphPad Prism 8 was used for plotting and statistical analysis (mean±standard deviation (SD)). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's post hoc test was used, and P<0.05 was considered significant.
