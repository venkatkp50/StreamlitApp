To determine whether HAdV-D56 uses a specific isoform of CD46, we compared the transduction efficiency by HAdV-D56 in CHO cells stably expressing all known human CD46 isoforms (BC1, BC2, C1, and C2) of CD46 (1). In order not to have our results influenced by differences in CD46 expression levels we first performed flow cytometry analysis to analyze the relative expression levels of the different CD46 isoforms. We observed a highly similar expression level of all isoforms except for the BC2 isoform that was expressed to a level ca 50% lower than the other isoforms ( Fig. S1 A) . HAdV-D56 transduced CHO cells expressing all isoforms better than the control cell line (Fig. S1 B) . After normalization of isoform expression levels to that of BC1, we observed that HAdV-D56 transduced C2-expressing cells most efficient and BC1-expressing cells least efficient ( Fig. S1 B) , a pattern that was different from that of the HAdV-C5/F35 vector, which transduced C1-expressing cells less efficient as compared to cells expressing the other isoforms. From these results we concluded that HAdV-D56 uses CD46 as a cellular receptor, and prefers the C2 isoform.As HAdV-D56 apparently engages CD46 through a different mechanism as compared to HAdV-B types, we compared the amino acid sequence of the CD46-binding knobs of HAdV-B35, -B11, -B7and -B21 to HAdV-D56 (Fig. S2 G) (2) (3) (4) . Interestingly, the main CD46-interacting regions are very different in HAdV-D56 with insertions in the DG loop and deletions in the GH, HI, and IJ loops.HAdV-D56 also lacks the two arginine residues at positions 279-280, which are known to pivotal for high affinity CD46 interaction by HAdV-11 (3) . With this in mind, we crystallized the knob of HAdV-D56 and determined the structure to investigate what these changes means in relation to the orientation of exposed loops. Crystals of the HAdV-D56 fiber knob were obtained by sitting drop vapour diffusion and a structure was determined to a resolution of 1.38Ã… using molecular replacement (Table S1) . Interestingly, all loops involved in interactions with CD46 are severely distinct from HAdV-B11, and HAdV-B7, thus preventing or at least weakening the interaction with CD46 ( Fig. S2 H) . Together this support that the binding mechanism differs from known CD46binding HAdVs and likely explain why studies performed to date have failed to determine an interaction between HAdV-D fiber knobs and CD46 (5).For materials and methods relating to the supporting information, we refer to the materials and methods section in the main text. . The superimposed complex between HAdV-B11 and CD46-D2 is shown in grey (HAdV-B11) and red (CD46-D2). The superimposition clearly shows that the HAdV-D56 knob has a drastically different surface loop structure compared to the CD46-binding HAdV-B7 and HAdV-B11 knobs, and is therefore not expected to bind CD46. Data is presented as mean +/-SEM from three independent experiments in duplicates, where *=< 0.05, **= < 0.01, ***=< 0.001. S4 . Phylogenetic tree of HAdV-D hexon proteins. Reference sequences from hexons of all known HAdV D types were aligned and a phylogenetic tree was generated using Clustal Omega (6) . HAdV D types used in Fig. 4 are marked in yellow. Prototype sequences used for construction of the phylogenetic tree are described in Table S2 .
