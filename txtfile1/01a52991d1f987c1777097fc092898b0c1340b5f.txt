Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, also known as 2019-nCoV) 35 caused the COVID-19, which has been declared by the World Health Organization to be a global 36 pandemic. The COVID-19 has caused over 219,000 fatalities (as of April 29th, 2020) with more was also investigated in another study, which aims to develop molecules that interfere the binding 70 of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to hACE221. Their results showed that a 23-residue peptide (residues 21-71 43) of hACE2 N-terminal helix was able to bind to the RBD with nanomolar affinity, comparable 72 to that of full length hACE2. They also reported that a 12-residue peptide (residues 27-38) failed 73 to bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. In a computational study, a 31-residue peptide derived from S19  A475  Q24  N487  T27  F456, A475, Y489  F28  Y489  D30  K417, F456  H34  Y453, L455  D38  Y449, G496  Y41  Q498, T500, N501  Q42  Q498, Y449  L45  Q498  M82  F486  Y83 F486, N487 forms. This observation suggests that those peptides prefer a similar helical conformation as they 195 were in the full hACE2 protein in solution, and the binding to the RBD resulted induced 196 conformational changes, which are more pronounced for shorter peptides, such as SIF8 and SIF9.

Under the consideration of peptide stability, longer peptides are preferred according to the 198 simulation results.

The SIF stability was also measured with their helicity contents in the free and bound forms (Table   200 2). The peptides SIF1 to SIF4 showed high helical contents (~80%) when they are in complex with 201 the spike protein RBD. It is interesting to observe that longer peptides tend to maintain stable helix to be effective in inhibiting the hACE2 binding. Figure 7 illustrates the binding energy 239 dependency on helical contents, especially the helicity of free peptides (solid black circles in 240 Figure 7) . Among the strong binders, whose binding energy are lower than -50 kcal/mol, there is 241 a shared sequence segment composed of the residues (24-39). The major difference for SIF's with 242 stronger binding affinity compared to the common sequence in all SIF's are the residues of (24-
