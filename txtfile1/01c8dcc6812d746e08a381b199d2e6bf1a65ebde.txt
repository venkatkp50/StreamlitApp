Second, I would also thank you for considering our suggestions, which I really believe will be valuable in the process of improving the paper before its publication. The topic and objectives of the paper are of relevance in the current situation and its results and lessons learned may be of interest to tackle the issue of accessibility of irregular immigrants to healthcare service in the Spanish healthcare system and similar contexts. Before its final publication though I propose to consider the following ideas: Introduction: -Page 5; line 27: Please consider including a reference to support the first statement of this paragraph.Methods: -Page 6; line 42: Include a brief description of outside consultants who were asked for input to develop the interview guide (professional background, genre). -Page 8-9; line 11: check spelling of "academics". -Which were the criteria to stop recruiting more interviewers?

GENERAL COMMENTS

The paper addresses a very relevant and important issue, namely the legal grounds and practical implications around access to health care for undocumented migrants in a EU country with a long standing tradition of universal access to health care, eroded by economic and policy developments over the last 10 years. It has to be noted that the introductory assumption -that the legal status of UDM is unclear -is only really valid if national and supranational legislative frameworks are looked at at the same time; and there is a quite considerable collection of frameworks on national level for EMS available in this respect. Methodologically, the paper does insufficiently describe it sampling procedures. The limites sample size may be fine, but should be supported by providing greater detail concerning the selection of interviewees. The result section is rather poorly structures and does not provide the reader with a context in which to put the results presented.It remains unclear what is the added value of the paper to the existing body of evidence concerning legal frameworks and governmental / non-governmental stakeholders in the area of health care for UDM

VERSION 1 -AUTHOR RESPONSE

Reviewer #1:Dear authors, First of all, thank you for working on the idea of the paper and adding such a relevant knowledge to the existing literature to the field of healthcare access and equity. Second, I would also thank you for considering our suggestions, which I really believe will be valuable in the process of improving the paper before its publication.The topic and objectives of the paper are of relevance in the current situation and its results and lessons learned may be of interest to tackle the issue of accessibility of irregular immigrants to healthcare service in the Spanish healthcare system and similar contexts.Before its final publication though I propose to consider the following ideas:Introduction:4. Page 5; line 27: Please consider including a reference to support the first statement of this paragraph.We have added references 6 and 7 to support the first statement of the paragraph."Of the policies that do exist, many are centered around the initial phase of treating migrants' health issues, such as infectious diseases, public health screenings, and vaccinations, rather than how displaced migrants can access health care from public systems once they are re-settled. 6,7 "(Page 4, Line 23) Methods: 5. Page 6; line 42: Include a brief description of outside consultants who were asked for input to develop the interview guide (professional background, genre).Done. We have included a description of outside consultants to this paragraph."The interview guide (Annex Table 1 ) was developed by both investigators after extensive literature review 14,21-34 and input from experts in the field of public health and healthcare management with knowledge and experience in the issues of access to healthcare for immigrants, including undocumented migrants." (Page 5, Lines 36-28) 6. Page 8-9; line 11: check spelling of "academics".We have changed "academicians" to "academics" on page 6, line 9.7. Which were the criteria to stop recruiting more interviewers? Is there any reason not to include more people in the sample of interviewers? Please clarify it in the manuscript.Thank you for mentioning this important omission on our end. We have now included a more thorough explanation of these criteria and the basis on which we determined our sample size as follows:"Our criteria for stopping recruitment of participants for the study was based on the concept of saturation, with a minimum of 6 interviews. We used the number of 6 interviews as the minimum based on prior work showing that 5-6 studies generally identify the majority of themes. [40] [41] [42] We interviewed 12 individuals, reaching saturation at the eighth interview, using the aforementioned semistructure format." (Page 6, Lines 16-20)Results:8. Review this section and consider eliminating some paragraphs in case the ideas have been repeated previously. For example, (pages 9-10) the idea of "the 5 situations in which every person in an irregular situation had access to the health care, under the Royal Decree 16/2012).Thank you for your comment. We have eliminated repetitive descriptions of the 5 exception populations. We have also removed several paragraphs and edited the Results section to be more concise.9. It would also be interesting to add quotations and voices from different interviews, if possible. Almost all quotations correspond to the same interviews.Thank you for this comment. We have now included several quotations from respondents who were not previously quoted in the text. We have also added 2 new quotations to section 3.1 on Page 7, as described in our response to comment #17 in this Response to Reviewers document."The main barrier is the administrative one and the disparity of practices when applying the existing regulations. Because in each health center, they have ... a person who is a social worker who must interpret that regulation. The regulations are interpreted in such a way that, from one health center to another, one social worker â€¦ interprets that the person has to be registered in order to meet [the] three months [requirement] , and others who say that [they can meet the three-month requirement] with a Spanish entry stamp in their passport." (011 F) (Page 9, Lines 1-7)"Generally speaking, someone is not expellable for [not] being registered. Still there is fear because, of course, when you are a foreigner, you do not know very well what your rights are, you do not have all the information. There are people who prefer, although they could register, they prefer to be hidden." (002 M) (Page 10, Lines 4-7)"Barriers, from our experience... one, now, is linguistics, and that is that many people who do not know the language, therefore, will not know what the chances are that someone who is in irregular situation will have health care or not." (011 F) (Page 10, Lines 9-11) "It is true that registration is an important barrier for people in an irregular situation because many of them cannot demonstrate living in the flat in which they live or living in situations of sub-housing." (006 M) (Page 12, Lines 1-3) "Spanish autonomous communities' disparate application of the national law regarding healthcare entitlements has also been cited in previous literature. 22,28 This is supported by our findings suggesting that the legal ambiguities of the provisions stated in the RDL 2018 exacerbate the inevitable deviations in application of a national law and produce even greater departures from the intended law. Our findings also contribute to the current body of knowledge by revealing insights into the situations encountered by a diverse sample of healthcare workers, government officials, and members of advocacy organizations who are most closely involved with the provision of healthcae for undocumented migrants in Spain. In doing so, this study reveals the impact of not only legal, administrative regulation, but also the way in which the application of these regulations translates into real access to healthcare for irregular migrants." (Page 13, Lines 18-27) "This study adds to the literature on administrative complexities and lack of stakeholder awareness by demonstrating that the culminating effects of both legal and administrative barriers work collectively to further intensify the lack of access to care among undocumented migrants in Spain." (Page 13, Lines 36-41) "Our findings are also supported by studies that have indicated that the use of the Spanish healthcare system by immigrants is not higher than that by the local population, suggesting that there is little incentive to restrict irregular migrants' access to healthcare. 21 " (Page 13, Lines 39-41).13. Include any limitation that may exist when interpreting results.Thank you for this comment, which echoes that of the Editor. Please see our thorough response with quoted text to comment #3 in this Response to Reviewers document. Table 1: 14. It would be interesting to show the distribution of regions which are represented by the participants in the interviews. Specially those representing NGOs, hospital, university and office of immigration. I suggest adding a new column for it. We have added a "Province" column to Table 1 in order to demonstrate the distribution of regions represented by the respondents.I believe considering these issues will add robustness to the paper. Good luck! Reviewer #2:The paper addresses a very relevant and important issue, namely the legal grounds and practical implications around access to health care for undocumented migrants in a EU country with a long standing tradition of universal access to health care, eroded by economic and policy developments over the last 10 years.15. It has to be noted that the introductory assumption -that the legal status of UDM is unclearis only really valid if national and supra-national legislative frameworks are looked at at the same time; and there is a quite considerable collection of frameworks on national level for EMS available in this respect. Thank you for this comment. Our introduction is indeed referring to supra-national legislative frameworks more generally, and we provide more specifics regarding the entitlements granted to undocumented migrants in the Spanish context in the Methods section 2.1. We have now also added: "Globally, irregular (or "undocumented") migrants generally hold an uncertain legal status with few entitlements in their host countries, especially when taking into account national and supranational legislative frameworks." (Page 4, Lines 3-8) Migrants whose requests for asylum in Spain are denied find themselves in a vulnerable administrative situation. These irregular migrants have an uncertain legal status in the country which may jeopardize their ability to apply for work permits, housing, and social programs such as education and healthcare. 12,13" (Page 4, Lines 33-35) 16. Methodologically, the paper does insufficiently describe it sampling procedures. The limited sample size may be fine, but should be supported by providing greater detail concerning the selection of interviewees.Thank you for this important comment, also mentioned by the Editor. Please see our responses to comments #3 and 7 in this Response to Reviewers document.17. The result section is rather poorly structured and does not provide the reader with a context in which to put the results presented. Thank you for your comment, which encouraged us to review our results section. We are aware of the complexity of proposing a properly structured and comprehensible results section, which clearly presents the findings of the study through the topics that have emerged and the discourses of the interviewees. Although the information has been presented in thematic subheadings, we agree with the reviewer that the context should be strengthened, especially in section 3.1, The context of universal healthcare in Spain pre-2012. We have reinforced this section to provide more context to the reader at the beginning of the results section. "Prior to 2012, the Spanish system essentially provided universal healthcare for all, and this included irregular migrants, even if they were in the process of applying for health cards." (Page 7, Lines 17-18) We also added several additional quotations and reinforced their explanation as follows:"Several participants mentioned that the national health system before 2012 provided healthcare for everyone, but that after restrictions began in 2012, reversing these restrictions was challenging. 'Till 2012, the Spanish laws and the will of the majority of health professionals was an attention that tended towards universality. [The system was] more and more universal until the appearance of a Royal Decree in 2012 that clearly broke that trend.' (007 F) 'Before the Decree of 2012, assistance was for everyone. It is a very open national health system. It all started from 2012, and when you go in one direction, going back is very difficult.' (003 M)" (Page 7, Lines 28-38) 18. It remains unclear what is the added value of the paper to the existing body of evidence concerning legal frameworks and governmental / non-governmental stakeholders in the area of health care for UDM.We have further explained the added value of this paper to the existing evidence of legal frameworks and to stakeholders."Our findings also contribute to the current body of knowledge by revealing insights into the situations encountered by a diverse sample of healthcare workers, government officials, and members of advocacy organizations who are most closely involved with the provision of healthcare for undocumented migrants in Spain. In doing so, this study reveals the impact of not only legal, administrative regulation, but also the way in which the application of these regulations translates into real access to healthcare for irregular migrants. I believe that changes made have contributed to improve the quality of the paper before its publication. However, I think some minor changes are still necessary before the final version of the manuscript is published.Find below my responses to authors to each of the points raised.Once more, I congratulate authors for their idea to do this research and contribute to such a necessary area of knowledge in the path to guarantee equity and quality in healthcare access.

Responses to authors:

Introduction: 4. Page 5; line 27: Please consider including a reference to support the first statement of this paragraph.We have added references 6 and 7 to support the first statement of the paragraph. "Of the policies that do exist, many are centered around the initial phase of treating migrants' health issues, such as infectious diseases, public health screenings, and vaccinations, rather than how displaced migrants can access health care from public systems once they are re-settled.6,7"(Page 4, Line 23) Thank you for considering this suggestion. I believe these modifications provide further robustness to the study.Methods: 5. Page 6; line 42: Include a brief description of outside consultants who were asked for input to develop the interview guide (professional background, genre). Done. We have included a description of outside consultants to this paragraph. "The interview guide (Annex Table 1 ) was developed by both investigators after extensive literature review14,21-34 and input from experts in the field of public health and healthcare management with knowledge and experience in the issues of access to healthcare for immigrants, including undocumented migrants." (Page 5, Lines 36-28) I would suggest including some more detail about their background and profile, if possible, for each of the experts consulted. For example, information on genre, affiliations or their profile (academics, politicians, managers, technicians). 6. Page 8-9; line 11: check spelling of "academics".We have changed "academicians" to "academics" on page 6, line 9. Ok. 7. Which were the criteria to stop recruiting more interviewers? Is there any reason not to include more people in the sample of interviewers? Please clarify it in the manuscript. Thank you for mentioning this important omission on our end. We have now included a more thorough explanation of these criteria and the basis on which we determined our sample size as follows: "Our criteria for stopping recruitment of participants for the study was based on the concept of saturation, with a minimum of 6 interviews. We used the number of 6 interviews as the minimum based on prior work showing that 5-6 studies generally identify the majority of themes.40-42 We interviewed 12 individuals, reaching saturation at the eighth interview, using the aforementioned semistructure format." (Page 6, Lines 16-20) Thank you for this clarification. I would suggest eliminating the extract "reaching saturation at the eighth interview", since it does not add, but it leads to confusion amongst readers. Results: 8. Review this section and consider eliminating some paragraphs in case the ideas have been repeated previously. For example, (pages 9-10) the idea of "the 5 situations in which every person in an irregular situation had access to the health care, under the Royal Decree 16/2012). Thank you for your comment. We have eliminated repetitive descriptions of the 5 exception populations. We have also removed several paragraphs and edited the Results section to be more concise.Ok, I believe this results section has gained in clarity and ideas are much more succinctly presented. Short and clear.9. It would also be interesting to add quotations and voices from different interviews, if possible. Almost all quotations correspond to the same interviews. Thank you for this comment. We have now included several quotations from respondents who were not previously quoted in the text.

(006 M) (Page 12, Lines 1-3) I agree with comments of the other reviewer and I congratulate authors for their effort to adequate the manuscript to our suggestions. I really think there has been an improvement with respect to the structuring of the ideas. I highly value the effort for including different voices in the results section, but I would consider including at least once quotations of every interviewee. If not possible, consider including the perspective and voices of different profiles and geographical contexts. Is there any significant difference between the experiences and points of view by gender, position or institution? It would also be interesting to mention it, if that is the case. "Spanish autonomous communities' disparate application of the national law regarding healthcare entitlements has also been cited in previous literature.22,28 This is supported by our findings suggesting that the legal ambiguities of the provisions stated in the RDL 2018 exacerbate the inevitable deviations in application of a national law and produce even greater departures from the intended law.

Please see our thorough response with quoted text to comment #3 in this Response to Reviewers document. I believe that the first limitation to which you refer is not in itself a limitation. From the methods section, it is assume that including more interviewees to the research process would not add relevant new information. The principle of saturation supports you to from not conducting more interviews. Please, clarify this point at the text and modify the manuscript accordingly.

Is there any significant difference between the experiences and points of view by gender, position or institution? It would also be interesting to mention it, if that is the case.Thank you for this suggestion. We included quotations from 9 out of 12 total participants and reached saturation at the eighth interview. We chose not to include quotations from 3 of the participants (numbers 001, 010, and 012) because their perspectives and responses echoed those already included in the manuscript in the form of quotations from other interviewees. We wanted to avoid being repetitive in order to maintain conciseness in our Results section. Table 1 outlines the sex, professional profiles, institutions, and geographical contexts of each participant. Our sample size was small; there were no obvious differences between the experiences and points ofiew by gender, position, or institution. "Spanish autonomous communities' disparate application of the national law regarding healthcare entitlements has also been cited in previous literature. 22, 28 This is supported by our findings suggesting that the legal ambiguities of the provisions stated in the RDL 2018 exacerbate the inevitable deviations in application of a national law and produce even greater departures from the intended law.

Please see our thorough response with quoted text to comment #3 in this Response to Reviewers document.I believe that the first limitation to which you refer is not in itself a limitation. From the methods section, it is assume that including more interviewees to the research process would not add relevant new information. The principle of saturation supports you to from not conducting more interviews. Please, clarify this point at the text and modify the manuscript accordingly.We have edited our description of the first limitation to better clarify how our methodology addresses this limitation. It now reads: "First, we had a limited number of respondents, which could be interpreted as a limitation as it can limit the diversity of perspectives in a body of work. However, our method of choosing the number of respondents was based on the principle of saturation, where additional interviews do not yield additional themes, data, or insight for the work. 63 The idea of saturation originates in grounded theory and is often considered the 'gold standard' in qualitative inquiry 41,64 "(Page 14, Lines 13-18).
