SARS-CoV-2 infection in 67 subjects (74%) was confirmed either by a PCR test (n=42), SARS-108 CoV-2 spike or nucleoprotein specific IgG by ELISA and Luminex testing (54 and 32 subjects, 109 respectively) or viral RNA detection in plasma (n=11) by a sensitive CRISPR assay [33, 34] .

As expected, SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies were significantly elevated in subjects with SARS-

134

CoV-2 infection compared with uninfected individuals (Figure 2A, Figure S1 ). No significant 135 differences were observed between infection groups with respect to the levels of antibodies 136 against the seasonal coronaviruses. Sampling times post-infection differed across the cohort.

137

While the time between sampling and infection did not correlate with increasing/decreasing IgG1 138 across individuals, elevated levels of IgG4 were observed in samples collected further from 139 infection, suggesting temporal development of virus-specific IgG4 ( Figure 2B) . A subset of 140 subjects (n=18) returned for follow-up visits six months after visit 1 (and before any vaccination).

In these subjects, spike-and N-specific IgG responses were relatively stable over time ( Figure   142 S2). However, a small but significant increase in spike-specific IgA1 was observed in the follow-

Activation was 174 assessed by flow cytometry of stimulated versus non-stimulated PBMC cultures by gating for 175 CD134-high expression on CD4+ T cells or CD69 expression on CD8+ T-cells as a modified 176 activation-induced marker expression (AIM) (Figure S4A,B) . As previously reported in SARS-

177

CoV-2 infected subjects [4, 24, 26] , significant CD4+ and CD8+ T cell AIM to spike protein or 178 peptide were observed compared to non-infected subjects ( Figure 3A ). CD4+ T cell AIM 179 responses were stable over 6 months in the individuals who returned for a follow-up visit ( Figure   180 S2E-F) and were not correlated with the day of sample collection ( Figure S4F ). Interestingly, a 181 subset of infected subjects had detectable T-cell responses with no observable antibody 182 responses ( Figure S3A,B) , indicating that these subjects exhibit cellular sensitization without 

187

Induced cytokine secretion was highly correlated among almost all restimulation antigens 188 including spike protein, spike peptide, N peptide, or matrix peptide ( Figure S5 ). As anticipated [4, 189 24-28], Th1-biasing IL-2 and IFNγ secretion was observed in response to spike and nucleoprotein, 

196

IL-17, the latter of which was highly correlated to IL-2 responses ( Figure S5 ). Significant changes 197 in parameters such as IL-4, IL-10, Granzyme B, and perforin were not observed for any stimulation 198 condition related to infection status ( Figure S4E ).

199

As T-cell and cytokine secretion can impact the generation of antibodies and have been 200 implicated in pre-existing immunity to seasonal coronaviruses, we correlated cellular immunity 201 measures with SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal coronavirus IgG antibodies ( Figure 3G ). CD4+ T-cell 202 AIM, IL-2 secretion, and Th1-associated cytokines were significantly correlated to plasma levels 203 of SARS-CoV-2 spike, RBD, and N IgG. Spike peptide pools but not protein for AIM significantly 204 correlated to OC43 and NL63 IgG. In contrast, symptom score was highly associated with TNFα, 205 IL-4, and IL-10, even though these cytokines individually were not different between infected and 206 non-infected subjects, suggesting that these cytokines track with disease severity.

Age drives immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

208

The diversity of the study cohort (Table 1 ) allowed us to evaluate the relationship between age, 209 sex, and SARS-CoV-2 immunity. In infected subjects, higher levels of chronic conditions and 210 SARS-CoV-2 symptom scores were associated with increasing age ( Figure 4A ) and correlated 211 with increased levels of spike-specific IgG1, neutralizing antibodies, IL-2, CD8+ T-cell activation, 212 and the related antiviral cytokines perforin and Granzyme B (Figure 4B-D) . Minimal changes in 213 seasonal coronavirus IgG were observed with age ( Figure 4B ). Sex had no significant impact on 214 .

(which was not certified by peer review)The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted April 22, 2022. ; https://doi.org/10.1101 https://doi.org/10. /2022 these measures ( Figure 4B) ; however, both sex and age were significantly related to IgM 215 antibody levels to Spike and RBD ( Figure 4B ).

216

Immunity in infected subjects can be separated into two groups based on Th1 or Th2 217 biased immune responses and antibody isotypes (IgM/IgG1 or IgG2/IgG4).

218

To dissect the relationship between cellular and serologic immunity with all disease parameters 219 and demographic information, we used t-SNE and UMAP data visualizations for immune 220 response to SARS-CoV-2 proteins or peptides. These analyses resulted in two distinct 221 populations (e.g., t-SNE 1 and t-SNE 2) verified by k-means clustering ( Figure 5A, Figure S6A ).

222

These populations were compared for all measures of SARS-CoV-2 immunity, demographic, 223 infection, or other seasonal coronavirus variables (Table S2) . Across the demographic and 224 disease variables, older age was associated with population 1, and minor symptoms or specific Table S2 ). Neutralization 235 in this population did not correlate to Th1 cytokines but was negatively correlated with IL-4 ( Figure   236 5D, Figure S6E ). In addition, perforin and ADNK activities were higher, suggesting population 2 237 may have higher NK or NKT cell activity. These data indicate that within this non-hospitalized 238 cohort, SARS-CoV-2 immunity can diverge into Th1-biased immunity (observed in population 1) 239 or Th2-biased immunity (observed in population 2), likely related to patient age. It is possible that 240 lingering viral infection or antigen also contribute to population differences, as this showed up in 241 both UMAP and correlation analyses. (Figure 5E, Figure S6B ).

242

These observations were complemented with a network analysis of immune parameters in SARS-

243

CoV-2 infected subjects, which demonstrated that neutralizing and functional antibody levels were 244 associated with CD4+ T cell help (indicated by CD4+ AIM and induction of Th1 cytokines),

245

whereas T cell production of IL-4 and IL-10 were negatively associated with antiviral antibody 246 functions ( Figure 5E ). The univariate correlation analysis between these T cell parameters, 

253

Together, these data suggest that the balance of Th1/Th2 CD4+ T-cell responses played a key 254 role in developing qualitative SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses and points to a potential role for

255

IgM, but not IgG1, responses against seasonal coronaviruses in promoting Th1 immunity.

To understand how prior SARS-CoV-2 immunity resulting from infection impacted vaccine-262 mediated immunity, we obtained follow-up samples from a subset of infected subjects who 263 received SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (n=32; age 16-79 years old (mean 43) and 63% female). These

Finally, a comparison of the post-vaccination neutralizing antibody titers between subjects in 301 population 1 (Th1 biased immunity) and population 2 (Th2 biased immunity) showed a trend 302 towards higher neutralizing antibodies in population one post-vaccination ( Figure 6F ).

The combined induction of functional cellular and humoral immunity is likely a key factor in long-342 term immunity. We observed a much higher correlation of antibody measures to CD4+ T-cells 343 and cytokines than to CD8+ T-cells (Figure 3, 5) , consistent with other reports on humoral 344 memory [45, 46] . However, CD8+ T cell activation was also significantly detected and altered by 345 age (Figure 3, Figure 4) , and CD8 activation to spike peptide pools seemed to limit post-346 vaccination neutralization responses (Figure 6 ). This finding may reflect that specific CD8+ T-cell

Antibody-dependent, complement-mediated delivery of antigen to dendritic cells has been shown 356 to enhance production of neutralizing antibodies [43] , thus in addition to having higher numbers 357 of memory B cells, one potential hypothesis is that enhanced delivery of vaccine antigens to 358 antigen presenting cells by existing SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies helps drive higher 359 neutralizing antibody levels.

360

The development of Th1-biased responses in subjects within cluster 1 tracked with overall older 361 age, but not with symptom severity or SARS-CoV-2 infection. Intriguingly, subjects in cluster 2 362 reported experiencing more minor symptoms (e.g., nausea, runny nose (coryza), nasal 363 congestion, cough, and headache) or specific symptoms (e.g., loss of taste) and had elevated 364 levels of virus-specific IgG2 and IgG4 compared with subjects in cluster 1. While virus-specific 365 IgG1 and IgG3 were not different between the two clusters, antibody functionality and 366 neutralization were significantly different, highlighting that antibody features beyond IgG 367 subclasses may further drive differences in antiviral functionality between the two groups.

This study also revealed an association with Th2 cytokines, including IL-4, IL-13, and IL-10, which 374 inversely correlated to neutralization after infection but only weakly to post-vaccination 375 neutralization (Figure 2, Figure 6 , Figure S7B) . A Th2 profile has also been implicated in severe 376 COVID disease [31], though these patients were not in our study population.

Whether prior exposure to seasonal coronaviruses shapes SARS-CoV-2 specific immunity has 389 been a key question since the beginning of the pandemic. Pre-pandemic pediatric samples have (Figure 2, Figure S1 ), there were significant correlations 397 between antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike, and nucleoprotein and those to spike proteins of 398 seasonal coronaviruses ( Figure 2F ). Age did not correlate with the magnitude of these seasonal 399 coronavirus IgG antibodies (Figure 4) . We also observed that OC43 and NL63 IgG levels 400 correlated with activation of T cells with spike peptide pools, but not protein (Figure 3) 

422

cytokines between spike or peptide pools were highly correlated (Figure S5) , indicating T-cell 423 production. Also, high expression of IL-2 has been routinely observed from CD4+ T-cell and not 424 CD8+ T-cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection [28, 38] . In this study, IL-17A secretion was closely 425 .

Symptoms and illness severity scores 627 A general symptom score was calculated according to the September 2021 CDC classification 628 (prior to circulation of the Omicron variant). Two points were given according to each major 629 symptom: cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, loss of smell, and loss of taste. One-630 half of a point was given for each minor symptom: fever, runny nose, nasal congestion, sore 631 throat, diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, muscle aches, chills, nausea, and headache. Total symptom 632 score was calculated as the sum of the major and minor scores.

634

Because illness severity is not necessarily measurable by the point-based approach used for the 635 general symptom score, it was calculated according to clinical manifestations thresholds based 636 on lung involvement and impairments, as detailed in Baj et al. (2020, [63] ). Specifically, the 637 severity score was defined as severe (abdominal pain, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, 638 chest pain, vomiting, nausea, diarrhea); moderate (fever, cough, runny nose, fatigue, muscle 639 aches, loss of smell, headache, sore throat, loss of taste, nasal congestion, chills, repeated chills, 640 hair loss, toes); and asymptomatic (no reported symptoms).

Age was based on self-reported birth date at study enrollment. Body mass index (BMI) was 646 defined as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. For adults, BMI was 647 calculated as: as <18.5 (underweight), 18.5-30 (normal), and >30 (overweight/obese). For 648 children (aged under 18 years), BMI was calculated as <5 th percentile (underweight), between the 649 5 th and 95 th percentile (normal), and greater than the 95 th percentile (overweight/obese).
