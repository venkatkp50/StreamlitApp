In the short term, we should probably build on populists' and COVID-19 vaccine refusers' preference for the social media as a source of information about COVID-19. The Internet could be used collaboratively with physicians to spread correct information about the costs and benefits of accepting and refusing vaccination. Moreover, COVID-19's hoax and myths could be combated involving influencers such as millennial students in information campaigns targeted to people with low institutional trust (Deweyani et al., 2021) . As social identity dynamics are at play in the decision of refusing the COVID-19 vaccine (Weisel, 2021) , such influencers could also work to convince vaccine refusers to abandon their current allegiances from which their beliefs are derived and to join a different opinion-based group holding more rational evidence-based views.To conclude, we want to highlight that the COVID-19 vaccine refusal is not a unicum of the COVID-19 pandemic, to the point that the WHO placed vaccine hesitancy among the 10 most severe threats to global health. Thus, the idea that specific political and social ideologies, such as populist orientation, stand behind vaccine refusal can have social and health implications that go even beyond the current COVID-19 pandemic and might inform the management of new potential health emergencies.
