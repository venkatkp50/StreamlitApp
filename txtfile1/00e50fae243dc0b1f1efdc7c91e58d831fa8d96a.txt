In the management of allergic rhinitis, montelukast is similarly effective to oral antihistamines though less effective than corticosteroid nasal sprays. Nevertheless, montelukast is a potent cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist where it not only acts by directly blocking leukotriene receptors but also possesses anti-inflammatory effects and suppressive actions on cytokine production.

In fact, the computational model indicated a possible role of montelukast in binding to the catalytic site of the main protease of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the pathogen responsible for COVID-19, which may modulate and inhibit viral replication [2] .It has been recently reported that elderly asthmatic patients receiving montelukast had a significant reduction in the acquisition of COVID-19 compared to those without receiving montelukast [3] . Whether montelukast can be effective to decrease the risk of acquisition or to prevent severe outcomes from COVID-19 among paediatric patients needs to be confirmed in clinical trials. We nonetheless feel that montelukast should be considered by pediatricians to manage allergic rhinitis amid the COVID-19 pandemic considering its anti-inflammatory action and anti-viral activity.
