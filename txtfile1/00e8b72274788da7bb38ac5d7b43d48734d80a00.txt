Introduction

The recent outbreak of coronavirus , originating in December 2019 from Wuhan (China), has infected over ten million people and has resulted in more than 580,000 deaths worldwide. Early estimates have put the global economic costs of the pandemic at around $8.8 trillion. 1 Given its immense human and economic impacts, the COVID-19 outbreak has spurred a deluge of news and opinions. It has also triggered government policy responses such as mandatory closures and lockdowns. Major events like the pandemic often overshadow all other events in the media (Blendon et al., 2004; Mairal, 2011; Young et al., 2013) . A consistent influx of pandemic-related news can cause anxiety among investors, influencing their investment decisions (Ederington and Lee, 1996; Klibanoff et al., 1998; Tetlock, 2007) . Such sentiment related influences have a significant impact on trading in financial markets (Tetlock, 2007;  Kaplanski and Levy, 2010; Su et al., 2017) . Similarly, restrictive government policies can cause uncertainty which may stimulate portfolio reconstructions and abnormal trading activity (Zaremba et al., 2020) and destabilize the markets (Blau et al., 2014) .Liquidity and stability are important features of financial markets. 2 These factors tend to deteriorate under adverse market conditions such as crises and pandemics. Liquidity is being cited as a major concern during the COVID-19 pandemic (Adrian and Natalucci, 2020; Wilkes, 2020) . Economic theory suggests that bid-ask spreads tend to increase in the presence of risk and uncertainty (Glosten and Milgrom, 1985; Hasbrouck, 1988) , which in turn leads to the deterioration of liquidity in the markets. Liquidity in financial markets is affected by investors" ability to process information (Boubaker et al., 2019) . Liquidity also becomes a crucial policy area during financial crises (Brunnermeier, 2009) . Similarly, uncertainty has been known to adversely impact the volatility of stock markets (Veronesi, 1999; Pastor and Veronesi, 2012) .Recent studies find increased systematic risk and volatility in response to COVID-19 (Zhang et al., 2020; Albulescu, 2020; Zaremba et al., 2020) . However, none of these studies analyze stocklevel liquidity and volatility. We focus on three dimensions of the coronavirus pandemic and study their impact on stock-level liquidity and volatility in US equity markets. These dimensions are: 1) human costs i.e. cases and deaths associated with the virus, 2) general sentiment and the panic associated with the pandemic, 3) restrictive measures implemented by governments in the form of social distancing and lockdowns.We find that reported number of confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths, general negative sentiment generated by news, reduced mobility and restrictive government regulations have an adverse impact on the liquidity and volatility of the stock market at the individual stock level.Our study contributes to the literature along the following dimensions. First, it adds to the evolving literature on market response to pandemics (Akhtaruzzaman et al., 2020; Al-Awadhi et al., 2020; Albulescu, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Haroon and Rizvi, 2020a; Haroon and Rizvi, 2020b) . Second, we add to the literature on the association of media/news originated sentiment with stock market liquidity and volatility (Barberis et al., 1998; Tetlock, 2007; Uhl et al., 2015) .And finally, we extend the understanding of the impact of restrictive government policies on the stability and efficiency of financial markets (Blau et al., 2014; Blau, 2017; Baig, Blau, and Whitby, 2019; Baig, Blau, and Sabah, 2020) .The rest of this study is outlined as follows. Section 2 discusses data and methodology; Section 3 presents empirical results and section 4 concludes.

Data and Methodology

We obtain data from five different sources. Stock market information for the S&P 500 constituent stocks is obtained from Thomson Reuters Datastream. Our final data is a firm-day panel that consists of all the constituent stocks of the S&P 500 index for the period January 13 th , 2020 to April 17 th , 2020. US mobility trends report consisting of indexes on driving, walking, and transit is obtained from Apple 3 , we sum all these three individual indexes and utilize the aggregate index that we denote as USDWT. Stringency index is obtained from Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) 4 , we denote it in our study as STRINGENCY. We also obtain data on confirmed CASES and DEATHS in the U.S. from OxCGRT website and match it with John"s Hopkins database. Coronavirus worldwide sentiment index is obtained from RavenPack 5 , we denote it as GSENT in our study. Google trends data based on the search for the word "coronavirus deaths" in the US is obtained from Google Trends website 6 , we denote it as GTREND. We choose to begin our sample on January 13 th because our mobility data is available from that date.3 Beginning January 13, 2020, Apple has published daily mobility trends that are based on requests for directions in Apple Maps. More at "https://www.apple.com/covid19/mobility". 4 OxCGRT obtains publicly available information on 18 indicators of government response. A subset of these indicators consists of restrictive policies such as school closures, travel bans, etc. The containment and closurepolicy related scores are then aggregated into a common "Stringency Index" (Hale, Petherick, Phillips and Webster, 2020). More information is available at "https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirusgovernment-response-tracker". 5 The sentiment index computes the level of sentiment across all entities mentioned in the news alongside coronavirus. More details at "https://coronavirus.ravenpack.com". 6 We note that our results are consistent if we use other variations of the search word "coronavirus deaths". Our results also hold if we just use the google trends index for the word "coronavirus".From the stock level information, we create various variables following the prior literature (e.g. Blau et al., 2014; Blau, 2018a; Blau, 2018b; . PRICE is the closing share price. SIZE is the market capitalization computed by multiplying closing price with shares outstanding. SPREAD is the bid-ask spread calculated as the difference between ask and bid prices scaled by their midpoint. VOLUME is traded share volume. ILLIQUIDITY is the Amihud (2002) illiquidity measure computed as the absolute returns divided by dollar volume (scaled up by ten million). VOLT is the range-based volatility measure computed following Alizadeh et al., (2002) as the natural log of maximum price minus the natural log of the minimum price. GVOLT is the conditional volatility computed by estimating a GARCH (1,1) model using the first difference of daily returns. S&P represents the daily returns series for the S&P 500 index.To control for outliers, we trim our stock-level variables at the 1 st and 99 th percentile, though it does not qualitatively impact our conclusions. For our regressions, we log transform all our five indexes. We add one to the number of cases, the number of deaths, stringency and google trends indexes and then take the natural log to avoid excluding zero values. Our RavenPack sentiment index has a negative value throughout our sample. We take the absolute value of our sentiment series and then take its natural log which makes this variable increasing in negative sentiment. Table 1 provides summary statistics for our sample. These descriptive statistics provide us with a background and basic understanding of our sample and allow for a better interpretation of the significance of empirical results. We find that the average value of USDWT index is 255.6, GSENT is -48.6, GTREND is 36.1, and the STRINGENCY index is 31.9. An average stock in our sample has a PRICE of $111, Market capitalization (SIZE) of about USD 57 billion, VOLUME of about 5.4 million, ILLIQUIDITY of about 0.002, VOLT of about 4.8%, GVOLT of about 0.7%. S&P 500 index has an average return of about -0.2%, the minimum return of about -13% and a maximum return of about 9% during our sample period. Figure 3 presents the time series plot of the mobility index. The plot suggests that mobility sharply decreased from mid-March surrounding the spike in cases and deaths. Figure 4 presents the time series plot of the RavenPack sentiment index. The index has a general negative trend suggesting an overall decline in sentiment. Finally, figure 6 reports the time series plot of the google trends index. The index has a sharp increase surrounding the rise in cases and deaths due to coronavirus. The index also has a strong (negative) correlation with the RavenPack sentiment index. Baig, Blau and Sabah (2019) have used google trends indexes as a measure of sentiment. Accordingly, we utilize the "coronavirus deaths" google trends index as an additional measure of (negative) sentiment in the market.

Empirical Results

In the first set of tests, we examine the relation of various pandemic related indexes with our stock-level liquidity measures. Our analysis is based on regression models used in prior studies (e.g. Blau, 2017; Blau, 2018a) . We estimate the following OLS regression specification with robust standard errors clustered at the firm-level. The impact of COVID-19 is likely to vary across different industries. Therefore, we include industry fixed effects based on Fama-French 48 industry classifications in all our specifications 7 . In general, our results are in line with prior literature connecting fear-inducing news regarding infectious diseases (Ichev and Marinƒç, 2018; Donadelli et al., 2017) and restrictive government policies (Blau and Thomas, 2015) with liquidity in financial markets. For our independent variable LNCASES, we observe a strong and statistically significant relationship between coronavirus cases and the stock market liquidity. In economic terms, a one percent increase in cases is associated with about 0.041% increase in illiquidity measured using the Amihud (2002) measure while about 0.038% increase in illiquidity measured using bid-ask spreads. Similarly, for LNDEATHS, we observe about 0.04% to 0.045% decrease in liquidity using both our measures which suggest that an increase in both cases and deaths erode liquidity in the stock market. Moreover, an increase in the number of coronavirus cases by 10,000 is associated with about a 0.06% decrease in market liquidity measured via Amihud (2002) measure while 0.05% decrease in liquidity using bid-ask spreads. Similarly, an increase in the number of deaths by 1,000 is associated with a decrease in market liquidity by about 0.12% measured via Amihud (2002) measure while 0.11% decrease in liquidity using bid-ask spreads.For LNUSDWT, the coefficient is economically and statistically significant for both liquidity measures. In economic terms, one percent decrease in mobility is associated with about 0.22% increase in the Amihud (2002) illiquidity measure while about 0.42% increase in bid-ask spreads. It suggests that a decrease in mobility due to increased uncertainty, social distancing, and lockdowns have a significant negative impact on market liquidity. In columns [4] and [10] our independent variable of interest is LNGSENT. A higher value of this variable suggests a more negative global sentiment. Said differently, LNGSENT index indicates the extent of global panic. The coefficient on LNGSENT is statistically and economically significant in both columns. We find that a one percent increase in negative global sentiment is associated with a decline in market liquidity of about 0.15% using Amihud (2002) measure and 0.21% using the bid-ask spread measure. We use LNGTREND as our main independent variable in columns [5] and [11] . Like LNGSENT, our LNGTREND index is also a measure of (negative) sentiment. Similar to LNGSENT, we find that a one percent increase in GTREND is associated with an increase in market liquidity by about 0.16% when measured using the Amihud (2002) measure, and about 0.10% when measured using bid-ask spreads. This suggests that increased panic and negative sentiments contributed to market illiquidity. Finally, in columns [6] and [12] we use LNSTRINGENCY index as our main explanatory variable. In both specifications, we observe a strong positive relationship with market illiquidity. In economic terms, a one percent increase in stringency is associated with about 0.11% increase in Amihud (2002) measure and about 0.10% increase in bid-ask spread suggesting that government policies such as the closure of workplaces and non-essential businesses had a negative impact on market liquidity.For our second set of tests, we follow prior literature (e.g. Blau et al., 2014; Blau, 2017) and estimate the following regression specification: Our results are in conformity with prior strands of literature that connect distress and anxiety causing news (Mehra and Sah, 2002; Donadelli et al., 2017) and restrictive government policies (Blau, Brough, and Thomas, 2014; Zaremba et.al., 2020) 

Conclusion

We investigate the impact of multiple dimensions of COVID-19 pandemic on the liquidity and volatility of US equity markets. We are motivated by the nearly 580% rise in the CBOE VIX index during the month of April from its January levels and by the market-wide deterioration of liquidity (Adrian and Natalucci, 2020) corresponding with the rapid spread of coronavirus. Our results suggest that increases in confirmed cases and deaths due to coronavirus are associated with a significant deterioration of market liquidity and stability. Similarly, public fear and the implementation of restrictions and lockdowns seem to contribute to the illiquidity and instability of the markets.
