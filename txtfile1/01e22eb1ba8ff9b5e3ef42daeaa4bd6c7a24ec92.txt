Our study comprised those who visited the ED from 27 December 2019 to 6 May 2020, which would normally be the main season for these viruses. (Table S1 ). In 44 cases, the aetiology remained unclear. Most of the 42.0% patients who were hospitalised had an RSV infection (60.0%) and the median length of hospitalisation was also highest for this cohort (median 2.5 days), but not statistically significant. Hospitalised infants were younger (median 5.7 months,
