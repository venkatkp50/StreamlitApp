The same arguments can be made for Covid-19: when infection, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, occurs during pregnancy, maternal IgG antibodies against CoV-2-SRAS are transferred across the placenta; their concentration in cord blood correlates with the concentration of antibodies in the mother and the time between the onset of infection and delivery. This transplacental passage of specific antibodies of maternal origin induces protection of the newborn against SARS-CoV-2 infection [5] . Efficacy and safety data in pregnant women are still partial for the three vaccines currently licensed , whether they use the messenger RNA (Comirnaty® from Pfizer/BioNTech and COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna®) or a non-replicating viral vector (COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca®). Although no serious adverse events have been reported to date, these data need to be clarified by further clinical trials. However, animal studies have not revealed any adverse effects on gestation, fetal and post-natal development or fertility. For this reason, WHO authorizes vaccination against Covid-19 for pregnant women belonging to a group in which this vaccination is recommended. In the current context of progressive supply of vaccine doses, aware of the current difficulties of prioritizing the subjects to be vaccinated, the National Academy of Medicine recommends: • to consider pregnancy as a serious risk factor in case of SARS-CoV-2 infection and to protect each pregnant woman from any potential source of contamination;• to vaccinate any professionally or familyexposed pregnant woman, or carrying a comorbidity (age >35 years, BMI >25, hypertension, diabetes); • not to delay or interrupt a pregnancy because of the vaccination; • to preserve breastfeeding by women who have been infected with SARS-CoV2 or vaccinated during their pregnancy, as the antibodies transmitted by breast milk have a protective effect on the newborn.
