Nevertheless, recent reports have shown lower efficacies in kidney transplant recipients. In a cohort of 322 kidney transplant recipients only 48% showed anti-spike seroconversion 29 days after two doses of mRNA vaccine (2) . This raises concerns regarding SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections in this vulnerable population, as shown in several recent reports (3) (4) (5) .We here report a case of a 23-year old kidney transplant recipient (transplanted in 2020) who developed a moderate Covid-19 infection 6 weeks after receiving two doses of BNT162b2 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60 Testing was repeated 19 days after the PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Surprisingly, it showed the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG antibodies at a titre of 15.50 U/mL (cutoff value for positivity â‰¥ 1 U/ml).In summary, despite the lack of immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, the patient did develop a strong antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Better anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses have been described after infection (7) versus vaccination (2) in kidney transplant recipients. One may speculate that the reduction of the immunosuppressive therapy following confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis facilitated antibody production. The second issue is the presence of the Alpha (British) variant, suggesting that patients with low/non-detectable antibody production might be particularly susceptible to infection by variant strains (5) .Kidney transplant recipients should therefore continue to adhere to all safety and hygienic measures. There is an urgent need for studies that intend to improve vaccination responses in this vulnerable population. 3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60
