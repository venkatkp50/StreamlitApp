Introduction 41 42

Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) arise from the Hemopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow and 43 perform similar functions as the cells of the adaptive immune system but do not express the specific 44 antigen receptors (1-4). Like the CD8 + cytotoxic T cells of the adaptive immune system, one subset of the 45 ILCs, the natural killer (NK) subset, perform lytic functions, and like the type 1 helper (Th1), Th2, and Th17 46 subsets of CD4 + T cells, ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3 cell subsets perform helper functions through secretion of 47 cytokines (5, 6) . Similar to regulatory T cells (Tregs), regulatory subsets of ILC (ILCregs) that can modulate 48 ongoing adaptive immune responses are now being described in the literature (7, 8) . While some mature 49 NK subsets and ILC precursors circulate through the blood, ILCs, for the most part, reside in the mucosal 50 epithelia (9). They are the first responders who encounter the incoming pathogen to initiate and modulate 51 innate and adaptive immune responses soon after pathogen recognition. Thus, ILCs play a pivotal role in 52 immune surveillance and form the front-line of immune defense (10, 11) . 53The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, caused by a highly transmissible and 54 pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been posing a significant 55 challenge to humanity worldwide. The disease is prevalent globally, with 123 million confirmed cases and 56 2.70 million deaths (12). There have been 33.1 million confirmed cases in the United States alone, with 57 592,232 deaths as of June 3, 2021(13). SARS-CoV-2, a respiratory pathogen, is a positive-sense single-58 stranded RNA virus that attacks the host respiratory tract by primarily engaging the angiotensin-59 converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor expressed on the airway epithelial cells (14) . The ACE2 receptor is 60 identified as the primary receptor for viral entry, although the tyrosine-protein kinase receptor UFO (AXL) 61can also function as a receptor in the absence of ACE2 (15). Within hours after viral entry, numerous 62 virions are produced, which bud into the airways leading to the virus's spread in the lung tissue (16) . As 63 the first line of defense, epithelial cells, neutrophils, dendritic cells, and macrophages actively participate 64 in mounting innate and facilitate adaptive responses to . The ILCs resident in the 65 respiratory epithelial tissue play a seminal role in immune surveillance and contribute substantially to lung 66 defense, pathology, and disease in response to an incoming pathogen or microenvironmental changes 67 (20). Since ILCs lack antigen-specific receptors, it is speculated that they can be activated by 68 inflammatory mediators or by r some yet to be identified specific receptor/s. It is possible that ILC are 69 activated by direct or indirect interactions of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) with 70 pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) that are either membrane-bound, vesicular or cytosolic(21). 71 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f responds to IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18 to produce IFN- and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-) (49). ILC1 cells are 134 present in the liver, gut, salivary glands, and adipose tissue and mediate immune responses to intracellular 135 pathogens like CD8 + and CD4 + Th1 cells. In addition to the origination of ILCs in the lymphoid organ, studies 136 in mouse models present evidence that there is a feedback loop between the ILC1 development and the 137 HSC residing in the liver controlled by ICL-1 driven interferonproduction (IFN-) (50). The ILC2 138 development from the ILCp cells requires the IL-7 mediated expression of the transcription factor GATA 139 binding protein 3 (GATA3) (51, 52). ILC2 are found at the mucosal tissue sites, including lung, small 140 intestine, colon, and mesenteric lymph node (MLN), as well as in the bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, 141 and adipocyte tissue and are activated by cytokines including IL-33, IL-25, thymic stromal lymphopoietin 142 (TSLP), prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) to produce high levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-15. IL-13 and the epidermal 143 growth factor, amphiregulin (53, 54). Like CD4 T helper 2 (Th2) cells, ILC2 promotes protective immunity 144 to helminth infections, allergic reaction, tissue remodeling, and metabolic homeostasis (55, 56). ILC3 145 express the transcription factor retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor t (ROR-t) and produce 146 IL-17A, IL-22, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and/or tumor necrosis factor 147  (TNF-) in response to IL-1, IL-6, IL-23, and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) ligands (57). ILC3 ranks 148 the second most frequent subsets of the human pulmonary ILCs (58). There are two subsets of ILC3 149 populations which express different levels of natural cytotoxicity receptor (NCR). NCRand NCR + subsets 150 are the innate equivalent of Th17 and Th22 cells, respectively (59). Like Th17 cells, these cells respond to 151 extracellular microbial (fungi, bacteria) infections (57). 152The CLIPs are also precursors to the LTi precursor (LtiP) cells which ultimately give rise to the LTi 153 subset (60). Like the ILC3 subset, the LTi subset strictly depends on transcription factor RORt for 154 development but functions mainly in the fetal stages (61), although LTi-like cells can also be generated 155 during adulthood (60, 62). LTi cells can produce cytokine IL-22 and provide protective immune responses 156 against extracellular bacteria (63). LTi cells are required for lymphoid organogenesis (64) and directly 157 influence the development and function of adaptive immune cells (65). 158In addition to the above classified sub types of ILCs that mirror the Th1/Th2 type T cells, another 159 category of innate cells that are becoming increasingly important are the ILC (regs). ILC (regs) initially 160 identified in the lamina propria of small intestine are Lin − CD45 + CD127 + IL-10 + cells, do not express markers 161 associated with ILC1, ILC2, and IL3 subsets, and produce IL-10. The lineage of these cells can be tracked to 162 CHILP (66). A recent study reports describes a similar type of regulatory cells in the tonsils (8). The majority of ILCs found in the lung are bona fide tissue-resident cells locally maintained through self-180 renewal (67). In human lungs, under steady-state conditions, ILCs exist in much lower numbers and are 181 characterized as CD45 + , Lin -(i.e., CD3, CD19, CD11c, CD11b), and CD127 + cells (68, 69). The majority of the 182 ILC subsets in the human lungs comprise the NCR -ILC3 followed by the ILC2 and ILC1 subsets (68). Although 183 ILC2 is detectable in human fetal lungs as early as gestational week 14, they are rare in newborns' lungs. 184Still, in response to IL-33 secreted by lung epithelial and stromal cells, they can quickly expand to reach 185 the levels detected in adults by postnatal day 8 (70, 71). In addition, these cytokines enable the neonatal 186 limited. Although helper ILC subsets are primarily tissue-resident, they can also circulate in the blood. 258 Therefore, our understanding of these cells during COVID-19 is mainly limited to population changes in 259 the peripheral blood. In the lungs, the ILC2 subsets limit the viral-and allergen-induced type 2 responses, 260 recruitment of eosinophils, termination of inflammatory responses, and tissue repair (105) The ILC2 population is further divided based on the expression of CD117 (106) into CD117 high and 273 CD117 lo subsets. The CD117 lo subset secrete more type 2 cytokines and is expanded in 110) . There is not only a general decrease in the total ILC population but also alternations in the 275 expression of activation, migration, and differentiation markers that correlate with the severity of the 276 disease in the COVID-19 patients (87). ILC2 and ILCp express enhanced levels of CD69 expression and 277 reduced levels of CXCR3 and CCR4 (106, 107) . In severe COVID-19 patients, there is an increase in the 278 activating receptors NKG2D + in the ILC2 subset and a significant decrease in inhibitory receptors CD25 and 279 KLRG1 (106, 107) . These data suggest that COVID-19 modulates the levels of the total ILC population in 280 the peripheral blood, with most changes occurring in the ILC2 subset. These changes in the ILC subsets in 281 the peripheral blood correlate with increased expression of cytokines, IL-5, IL-13 that are secreted by the 282 ILC2 (107) (See Figure 1) . Further, the severity of disease, requirement for hospitalization, and increased A study in which scRNA-seq analysis was conducted on CD3 -/+ sorted cells from the BALF and PBMC 306 from 9 patients with COVID-19 and 5 patients with non-viral infection-associated pneumonia, innate-like 307 cells were identified in the blood and BALF of COVID-19 patients. Still, differences in the levels of these 308 populations were not established in the study (120). The presence of NK cells in BALF suggests a role for 309 these cell types in COVID-19. Furthermore, NK cells from infected patients were more responsive to type 310 1 interferon and showed a transcriptome correlated with an increased viral response (114). These data, 311 although preliminary, suggest that NK and ILC subsets are present in the lungs of the COVID-19 patients, 312where they may contribute to the observed inflammation and recovery/injury. 313 314

Activation of ILC as a prevention strategy for COVID-19 315

The severity of the COVID-19 illness, requirement for hospitalization, duration of symptoms, and 316 increased duration of hospital stay correlate with reduced numbers of ILCs (87). Conversely, convalescent 317 COVID-19 patients tend to have higher numbers of ILCs when compared to those who succumbed to 318 infection (106, 107). These findings suggest that induction and activation of ILCs could potentially prevent 319 and reduce disease severity with favorable outcomes. Studies conducted in our laboratory using either 320 the in vivo animal model or with human PBMCs in vitro show that ligands of pathogen sensors as well as 321 replication-defective adenoviruses induce/activate different ILC subsets as compared to unstimulated 322 controls (unpublished results). TLR7 agonist, imiquimod, is a FDA approved drug for external application 323 against actinic keratosis, external genital warts and certain forms of skin cancer (121, 122). Additionally, 324 in influenza mouse model of viral infection, intranasally administered imiquimod reduces viral replication, 325 airway and pulmonary inflammation, weight loss, and lung neutrophils levels (123). Furthermore, 326 imiquimod also reduced cytokines and chemokines and prevented influenza virus-induced lung 327 pathology. In our assays, TLR7 agonist stimulated activation of the ILC subsets, ILC1, ILC2, ILC3, and NK
