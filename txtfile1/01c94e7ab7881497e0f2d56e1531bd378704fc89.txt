Construct design, expression and purification of the glycosylated proteins RBD and FcεRIα.

The DNA codifying the S B domain of the RBD (amino acid residues 328-533) from the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (UniprotKB P0DTC2) was codon optimized for expression in human cells and synthesized by Genscript Biotech. The construct was subcloned into pHLsec vector [1] between AgeI and KpnI restriction sites, such that a 6x His tag was added to the C-terminus of RBD. RBD was transiently transfected into HEK239F (Thermo Fisher Scientific) suspension cells with the transfection reagent FectoPRO (Polyplus Transfections). Labelling of the Nglycans on RBD was achieved by adding 0.6 g of 13 C D-glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.) to 200 mL of transfected HEK293F cells. [2, 3] Transfected cells were FcεRIα [4] was expressed in HEK239F (Thermo Fisher Scientific) suspension cells as described for the RBD. Protein was purified through a HisTrap Ni-NTA column (GE Healthcare) followed by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 column (GE Healthcare).Construct design, expression and purification of human lectins. The carbohydrate recognition domains (CRD) of siglec-8 (residues 17-155), MGL (residues 181-316), galectin-3 (residues 114-250), the full length galectin-7 (residues 1-136) and the N-terminal domain of galectin-8 (galectin-8N, residues 1-155) were cloned into pET-43.1a (+) (Addgene), pET-21a (+) (NZYTech), pET-21a (+) (Addgene), pET-22b (+) (Novagene) and pET-21b (+) (Addgene) vectors, respectively. Expression and purification of unlabelled and 15 N-labelled protein was performed as described elsewhere. [5] [6] [7] The DNA codifying the full-length extracellular domain of siglec-10 (amino acid residues 17-537) (UniprotKB Q96LC7) fused to mVENUS [8] was synthesized, codon optimized for expression in human cells and cloned into pHLsec vector [1] [12] bmrb 17826 for galectin-7, [13] bmrb 27854 for DC-SIGN, [14] and bmrb 25798 for Siglec-8 [15] . Backbone resonance assignment for MGL and galectin-8N was carried out by us following standard protocols. [7] In the case of MGL a 1 H, 15 N-HSQC spectra using 180 µM concentration of the lectin, and adding µL volumes of unlabelled RBD stock solution in the same buffer, to achieve 1:0.5 and 1:1 ratios, were recorded. A suplementary 1 H, 15 N-HSQC experiment was carried out after addition of 1 equivalent of α-methyl GalNAc. Data analysis, including cross peak volume, was carried out in CcpNmr Analysis V2 software. [16] Molecular interaction studies by RBD glycan detected 1 H, 13 C-HSQC. 2D 1 H, 13 C-HSQC spectra of RBD with 13 C-glycan labelling were recorded using 60 µM of RBD, and adding µL volumes of the corresponding unlabelled lectin in the same buffer, to achieve 1:1 or 1:0.2 ratios. Cross peak volume integration was carried out in Bruker TopSpin3.5pl6 software.

Molecular modelling

Molecular modelling. The initial structures for the lectins/RBD complexes were built using the X-ray crystal structures of the carbohydrate recognition domains (CRD) of human galectin-3(PDB ID 4R9A), [17] galectin-7 (PDB ID 4GAL), [18] galectin-8 (N-terminal domain, PDB ID 5GZF) [19] and DC-SIGN (PDB ID 1SL5). [20] For MGL, and homology model was generated using the related asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR, PDB ID 5JPV) [21] as a template with the high-resolution comparative modelling module of Rosetta software. [22] In parallel, fully glycosylated models of SARS-CoV-2 RBD were built based on the cryo-EM structure of the spike protein on the prefusion conformation (PDB ID 6VSB), [23] which was later curated [25] and available at the CHARMM-GUI online server. [26] A non-glycosylated initial geometry for RBD comprising residues R328 to L533 was extracted from this model, and a polyhistidine tag (KHHHHHH) was added at C-terminus using PyMol software [27] to resemble the experimental conditions as closely as possible. Residues N331 and N343, both located near the N-terminal region, were then N-glycosylated using the glycoprotein builder available at the GLYCAM-Web online server. [28] The glycans modelled for each receptor/RBD complex were those showing the highest affinity by NMR spectroscopy and shared the same biantennary core (see Supporting Information). For simplicity, identical glycans with equal antennae were modelled at both N-glycosylation sites for each receptor/RBD complex, producing a total of ten starting models. In each case, the α3 branch of the RBD glycans were docked into the binding sites of the receptors by fitting the coordinates of the modelled carbohydrates mostly responsible for binding (i.e. D-Gal for galectin-3 and galectin-8; D-GalNAc for galectin-7 and MGL; L-Fuc for DC-SIGN) with those of the same or related ligands found in the X-ray structures of the lectins in the bound state. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations for each binary RBDreceptor complex were run with the AMBER suite, [29, 30] using the ff14SB [31] and GLYCAM06 [32] force fields. Initial structures were neutralized with either Na + or Clions and set at the centre of a cubic TIP3P water [33] box with a buffering distance between solute and box of 10 Å. For each complex, we followed a two-stage geometry optimization approach: the first stage minimizes only the positions of solvent molecules and ions, and the second stage is an unrestrained minimization of all the atoms in the simulation cell. The systems were then heated by incrementing the temperature from 0 to 300 K under a constant pressure of 1 atm and periodic boundary conditions. Harmonic restraints of 10 kcal mol -1 were applied to the solute, under the Andersen temperature coupling scheme. [34, 35] The time step was kept at 1 fs during the heating stages, allowing potential inhomogeneities to self-adjust. Water molecules were treated with the SHAKE algorithm [36] such that the angle between the hydrogen atoms is kept fixed through the simulations. Long-range electrostatic effects were modelled using the particle mesh Ewald method. [37] An 8 Å cutoff was applied to Lennard-Jones interactions. Each system was equilibrated for 2 ns with a 2 fs time step at a constant volume and temperature of 300 K. Production was run as a 200 ns NVT trajectory at 300 K with a time step of 2 fs using the Andersen thermostat. Representative snapshots at the end of the production trajectories were obtained using the cpptraj module of AMBER and rendered with PyMol. Figure S2   Figure S2 .
