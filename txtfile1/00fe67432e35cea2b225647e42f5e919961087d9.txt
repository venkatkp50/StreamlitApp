

Then we examined whether replication could also be rescued by co-expression of plasmid-237 encoded nsP2 or nsP3 and the respective replicon mutant RNA (CASA or V33E) 238 ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ). Co-expression of the nsP2-459-798 protease domain partially rescued 239 replication of the CASA mutant suggesting that indeed polyprotein synthesis takes place 240 . In contrast, co-expression of nsP3 or the isolated nsP3 241 macrodomain was not sufficient to rescue replication of a hydrolase deficient replicon mutant 242 (Supplementary Fig. 4d-f ). To overcome possible differences in the subcellular localization of 243 replication hubs and plasmid-expressed nsP3 macrodomain, we fused the macrodomain to an 244 anti-GFP-nanobody to enhance targeting to sites of replication of the EGFP encoding 245 replicons. We transfected HEK293 cells with plasmids coding for a GFP-nanobody-nsP3-246 macrodomain fusion protein prior to transfection with the 3 EGFP-replicon RNA. We analyzed 247 GFP by flow cytometry (Fig. 3i-k, Supplementary Fig. 5 ). Whereas the overall amount of GFP-248 positive cells when transfected with the V33E mutant was low compared to the wildtype and 249 stayed unaffected by co-expression of GFP-nanobody-nsP3-macrodomain (Fig. 3i) , we 250 observed an increase in GFP intensity dependent on hydrolytic activity of the GFP-nanobody 251 fusion protein (Fig. 3j, k, Supplementary Fig. 5 ). In line with this replication in presence of the 252 wildtype GFP-nanobody-nsP3-macrodomain was slightly but significantly increased (Fig. 3l) . 253Further, the analysis of nsP3 revealed an increase in its processed form (Fig. 3m,n) , indicating 254 that the co-expression of the GFP-nanobody-nsP3-macrodomain at least to some extend was 255 able to rescue the CHIKV replicon lacking hydrolase activity. 256 257 Taken together, these data suggest strongly that polyprotein synthesis of the different 258 mutated replicons occurs and further support the hypothesis that MARylation affects 259 polyprotein processing. 260

CHIKV nsP2 is a substrate for MARylation in vitro and in cells 261

Consequences of protein MARylation are poorly understood. Our previous studies indicated 262 that ARTD10-dependent MARylation impairs the catalytic activity of the kinase GSK3b, which 263 is antagonized by cellular MAR hydrolases [37, 49] . Furthermore, MARylation is reported to 264 affect protein-protein interactions, mRNA stability and translation [1] . Following our 265 hypothesis, we determined the consequences of MARylation on the protease activity of nsP2, 266 which is responsible for polyprotein processing [43] . Therefore, we tested whether nsP2 267 serves as substrate for mono-ARTDs. His6-tagged fusion proteins of CHIKV nsP2 or nsP2-459-268 798, comprising the protease domain, were incubated with His6-tagged catalytic domains of 269 ARTD7, ARTD8, ARTD10 and ARTD12 (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 6 ). The corresponding genes 270 are IFNa responsive (Supplementary Fig. 1a and [6] ). Moreover, we tested ARTD15, which is 271 not regulated by IFNa ( Supplementary Fig. 1a ). For all ARTD catalytic domains auto-ADP-272 ribosylation was measurable in presence of 32 P-NAD + even though the signal intensities varied 273 considerably between the different enzymes ( Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 6a The presence of nsP3 in ADP-ribosylation reactions using the catalytic domains of either 279 ARTD10 or ARTD12 reversed MARylation of nsP2 and the protease domain. Similarly, the 280 isolated macrodomain also efficiently de-MARylated nsP2 (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Fig. 6b) . 281We obtained similar results with nsP2 MARylated by full length ARTD10, while no MARylation 282 was obtained with ARTD10-GW (Fig. 4c ). In addition, nsP2 was reversibly MARylated by full 283 length ARTD12 (Fig. 4d) . To complement these in vitro findings, we measured MARylation of 284 13 nsP2 expressed in HEK293 cells transfected with the 2 EGFP replicon (Fig. 4e) . The 285 immunoprecipitated nsP2-2 EGFP stained positively with a MAR binding reagent. In support, 286 this staining was reduced upon incubation with the recombinant nsP3 macrodomain, 287 providing evidence that this protein is MARylated in cells (Fig. 4e) . Similarly, upon co-288 transfection of a plasmid expressing GFP-nsP2 and the V33E replicon, nsP2 stained positively 289 for MAR (Fig. 4f) . Taken together, we identified CHIKV nsP2 as a new substrate for MARylation 290 in vitro and in cells in context of a viral infection. 291 292

MARylation of nsP2 reversibly inhibits its proteolytic activity 293

Having identified nsP2 as a new substrate for MARylation, we aimed at determining the 294 consequences of this modification on proteolytic activity. Therefore, we established a 295 protease assay using an nsP3/nsP4 junctional peptide (DELRLDRAGG|YIFSS) fused to GST and 296 EGFP (Fig. 5a ) [50] [51] [52] . Accessibility between the two globular tags was achieved by including 297 a polylinker C-terminally of the cleavage site. This artificial substrate was cleaved by the 298 recombinant nsP2 protease with up to 90% processing observed after 120 min, but not by the 299 CASA proteolytically inactive mutant (Fig. 5b) . Of note is that neither the C-terminal EGFP 300 fragment (fragment 1) nor the N-terminal GST fragment (fragment 2) were further cleaved, 301 supporting the specificity of the protease activity. Both, the substrate and the two nsP2 302 variants were stable when analyzed individually over 120 min (Fig. 5b) . 303

304

To assess the role of MARylation, the nsP2 protease domain was modified by ARTD10cat. This 305 prevented cleavage of the substrate, while ARTD10cat-GW had no effect (Fig. 5c ). Successful 306MARylation of nsP2-459-798 is indicated by its mobility shift on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5c) . The 307 inhibition of the protease function by ARTD10cat was dose dependent (Fig. 5d ). To interrogate 308 14 whether de-MARylation was sufficient to reactivate protease activity, we co-incubated the 309 substrate with nsP2-459-798, ARTD10cat and nsP3 or nsP3-macro as indicated (Fig. 5e) . MARylation, which was evident in the presence of hydrolase either by the reduced mobility 311 shift or by staining with the MAR reagent, reactivated protease activity (Fig. 5e ). The 312 processing efficiency was quantified by measuring the intensity of unprocessed substrate and 313 the two fragments by immunoblotting and densitometric analysis. This documented that 314MARylation by ARTD10cat efficiently repressed nsP2-459-798 protease activity, which was 315 antagonized by nsP3 or the isolated macrodomain (Fig. 5e,f) . Thus, these findings demonstrate 316 that the nsP2 protease domain is reversibly inhibited by MARylation and support our initial 317 hypothesis that MARylation inhibits polyprotein processing. We provide a mechanism how 318 MARylation antagonizes and consequently how the nsP3 macrodomain contributes to CHIKV 319 replication. 320 321

Discussion 322

Taken together, we established that ARTD10 and ARTD12 interfere with CHIKV RNA 323 replication and identified CHIKV nsP2 as target for MARylation by IFN-inducible mono-ARTDs. 324Mechanistically, our results provide evidence for inhibition of the nsP2 protease function, 325 which is essential for viral replication, by ARTD10-dependent MARylation. This results in a 326 defect in CHIKV polyprotein processing and consequently in reduced replication. This 327MARylation-dependent inhibition of the protease activity is antagonized by the macrodomain 328 of nsP3. Accordingly, the lack of MAR hydrolase activity prevents polyprotein processing. Thus, 329 our findings elucidate a mechanism for the importance of a functional macrodomain for CHIKV 330 replication. 331 332 15 ARTDs have been linked previously to restriction of virus replication [22] . In this context the 333 best studied ARTD family member is ARTD13 (ZAP, Zinc-finger antiviral protein), which is able 334 to bind viral RNA, promoting its decay or interfering with its translation [53] . Further, ARTD13, 335 which is catalytically inactive, contributes to the establishment of an antiviral immune 336 response by crosstalk with the miRNA pathway, thereby stimulating expression of antiviral 337 proteins, and by amplifying RIG-I signaling [53] . Antiviral activities have also been assigned to 338 ARTD10, ARTD12 and ARTD14. Overexpression of these ARTDs was shown to interfere with 339 Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) replication [7] . Additionally, ARTD12 was 340 described to restrict Sindbis Virus (SINV) and CHIKV replication amongst other RNA viruses [7] . 341Further ARTD10, ARTD12 and ARTD14 downregulate cellular translation in cells infected with 342 VEEV, which in the case of ARTD12 depends on catalytic activity [8] . ARTD12 has also been 343 identified to restrict Zika virus (ZIKV) replication, which is mediated by depletion of the ZIKV 344 non-structural proteins NS1 and NS3 [26] . Dependent on its catalytic activity, ARTD12 seems 345 to promote poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation) of these two viral proteins. PAR chains in turn 346 are argued to serve as scaffold to recruit E3 Ubiquitin-ligases that modify NS1 and NS3 by K48-347 linked polyubiquitination and thereby enable their proteasomal degradation [26] . Indeed, this 348 concept has already been established for PARylation mediated by ARTD5 and 6 (tankyrase 1 349 and 2, respectively) [1]. More than 70 substrates have been identified to be regulated through 350 PAR-mediated poly-ubiquitination [54] . The proposed mechanism is that ARTD12, as it is 351 limited to MARylation, modifies NS1 and NS3, which serves as a seeding event for polymer 352 forming ARTDs, possibly ARTD5 or 6 [26]. However, the effect of MARylation on CHIKV 353 replication seems to be different as demonstrated by experiments with inhibitors of 354 proteasomal and lysosomal pathways in this study (Fig. 3a, b) . In addition to the ZIKV proteins, 355 the nucleocapsid protein of Coronavirus (CoV) was recently suggested to be ADP-ribosylated 356 during infection [55] . It will be interesting to identify the enzyme that catalyzes this 357 modification and moreover to define the molecular consequences, for example on capsid 358 formation. 359

In summary, these different reports suggest that ADP-ribosylation may interfere with multiple 361 viral functions. This is consistent with the observation that at least four of the 12 catalytically 362 active mono-ARTDs are induced by type I IFNs ( Supplementary Fig. 1a ) [1, 6, 11] . The fact that 363 the viral macrodomains display MAR hydrolase activity and thereby are able to reverse 364MARylation of viral as well as cellular substrates [6, 9, 10, 39] The artificial protease substrate (pGEX4T1-nsP3/nsP4-site-polylinker-EGFP) was created 474 based on the long nsP3/nsP4 site described in Rausalu et al. [51] . This sequence was ordered 475 as oligos containing EcoRI (5'-end) and BamHI (3'-end) restriction sites mimicking overhangs 476 (5'-aattcGACGAGTTAAGACTAGACAGGGCAGGTGGGTATATATTCTCGTCGgag-3', 3'-477 gatcctcCGACGAGAATATATACCCACCTGCCCTGTCTAGTCTTAACTCGTCg-5') that were annealed 478 in vitro. The sequence encoding EGFP was isolated from pEGFP-N1 using BamHI and NotI 479 restriction sites and EGFP as well as the annealed oligos were inserted into pGEX4T1 using 480EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites and ligation. Subsequently a polylinker was introduced into 481 this construct for better accessibility of the protease substrate. Therefore, oligos containing 482 this polylinker, the nsP3/nsP4 site and EcoRI (5'-end) and NcoI ( GTCAAGGAACGCAAGTGACAGTATCCAGCTCCGGACTCAGATCTCGAG-3'). This sequence was 500 inserted into GW-pEGFP-nsP3-macro or GW-pEGFP-nsP3-macro-V33E using the AgeI and XhoI 501 restriction sites and ligation, replacing the EGFP. 502 503 pEVRFO-HA and the pEGFP-ARTD10 constructs were described previously [14, 59] . pHA-, 504 pEGFP-C1-and pcDNA5/FRT/TO-C-TAP-ARTD12 were created from the pNIC-28-BsaI-ARTD12 505 (M1-Q701) plasmid that was obtained from O. Gileadi (Oxford) by gateway cloning. Constructs 506 for expression of eukaryotic fusion proteins of nsP2, nsP2-459-798, nsP3 and nsP3-macro 507 were cloned into pcDNA3-Flag, pHA, pEGFP-C1 or pcDNA5/FRT/TO-N-TAP with gateway 508 cloning using the SP6-CHIKV-replicon-SG-GLuc as a template. Mutants (except for replicon 509 mutants, see above) were generated using standard mutagenesis procedures (e.g. Q5 510 mutagenesis kit (NEB)) and confirmed by sequencing. pcDNA3-HA-ARTD1 was a kind gift from 511 M. Hottiger (Zürich) and pCMV-HA-ARTD14 from Andreas Ladurner (München). 512 513

In vitro transcription of replicon RNA 514

For in vitro transcription of replicon RNA, DNA plasmids encoding the respective replicon 515 variants were first linearized with NdeI. Subsequently, linearized DNA was transcribed using 516 the mMESSAGE mMACHINE™ SP6 Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the 517 manufacturer's instructions. Cap-analog [m 7 G(5')ppp(5')G] and GTP were added to the 518 reactions to obtain 5'-capped RNA. Afterwards template DNA was digested by addition of 519 TURBO DNase and RNA was precipitated using the lithium chloride precipitation protocol. 520Finally, RNA was resuspended in elution buffer from the High Pure RNA isolation Kit (Roche). 521Purity was controlled by agarose gel electrophoresis, concentration was measured using a 522 NanoDrop™ 1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and RNA was stored at -80°C until transfection. the detection of the incorporated radioactive label, dried gels were exposed to X-ray films. 566 567 568 569In vitro ADP-ribosylation assays with immunoprecipitated ARTD10 and ARTD12 570 HEK293 cells were seeded and after 48 h transfected with plasmids encoding HA-ARTD10 or 571 the inactive GW mutant or with plasmids encoding GFP-ARTD12 using the calcium phosphate 572 precipitation technique. 48 hpt cells were lysed in TAP lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5; 150 573 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA; 10% glycerol; 1% NP-40; 2 mM TCEP; PIC) and the lysates were 574 centrifuged at 4°C for 30 min. HA-ARTD10 was immunoprecipitated with 1 μl of anti-HA 575 (BioLegend) antibody and protein G beads and GFP-ARTD12 with 5 µl of GFP-Trap magnetic 576 agarose beads (Chromotek) at 4 °C for 1 h. Afterwards the beads were washed in TAP lysis 577 buffer and reaction buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mM TCEP, 4 mM MgCl2). ADP-ribosylation 578 assays were carried out as described above (chapter In vitro ADP-ribosylation assays). 579 580 In vitro protease assay 581Bacterially expressed and purified His-nsP2-459-798, wt or inactive CASA mutant, were 582 incubated with synthetic substrate in 15 µl of reaction buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mM TCEP, 583 4 mM MgCl2) for 30, 60 or 120 min at 30°C. As a negative control substrate as well as proteases 584 were incubated alone in reaction buffer for 0 or 120 min at 30°C. The reactions were stopped 585 by the addition of SDS sample buffer. Samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and gels 586 subsequently stained with Coomassie blue to visualize the proteins. 587 588 ADP-ribosylation assay with subsequent in vitro protease assay 589 ADP-ribosylation assays were performed in 30 µl reaction buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mM 590 TCEP, 4 mM MgCl2) with 50 µM b-NAD + for 30 min at 30°C. Subsequently synthetic substrate 591 was added to the reactions and they were further incubated at 30°C for 30, 60 or 120 min at 592 30°C. As a negative control substrate was incubated alone in reaction buffer for 0 or 120 min 593 26 at 30°C. The reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer. Samples were 594 fractionated by SDS-PAGE and gels subsequently stained with Coomassie blue or subjected to 595 immunoblotting to visualize the proteins. 596 597

Immunoprecipitation for detection of MARylation in cells 598

HEK293 cells were seeded in 10 cm plates and 48 h after seeding transfected with plasmid 599 DNA coding for GFP-nsP2 using the calcium phosphate precipitation technique or not treated. 

Quantification of immunoblots and statistical analysis 635

Immunoblots were quantified using the Image J software (NIH, Bethesda, USA). The 636 significance was analyzed using a nonparametric, two-tailed Mann-Whitney test with the 637 GraphPad Prism software, since the number of values was too low to reliably test for Gaussian 638 distribution of the data. 639 640 641
