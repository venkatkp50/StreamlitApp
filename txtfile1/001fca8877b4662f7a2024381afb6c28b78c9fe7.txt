Introduction (read out):

I am …………………. from Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit, Bangkok. I am a researcher and I am approaching you to discuss on radical cure therapy for vivax malaria in Myanmar. As you know the countries in the South East Asia and Asia Pacific are heading towards malaria elimination, it is important to know the current epidemiological burden of malaria, policy priority, and bottlenecks for malaria elimination.Since the proportion of vivax malaria in the region is high compared to the falciparum malaria, it poses unique challenges and opportunities. In this study, I am interested to explore your perspectives on vivax malaria, current policies guiding treatment plans and the strategy to achieve malaria elimination in the nearest future. Your opinion and perspectives will guide us to specifically design the future research to generate evidence that can ultimately help policymakers to revise/enforce the existing policy or the implementation plan to cure the vivax malaria. There are no direct benefits attached to your participation in this study. I will respect your time and if you feel uncomfortable or distressed due to questions asked or the time consumed, you can inform me at any time and I will immediately stop the interview. Also, you can drop out of the interview at any time and you do not have to give me reasons for it. If you consent to participate, I would like to inform you that this interview will be anonymized, the information you will provide will be confidential. Please feel free to ask questions related to this study at any time before making a decision. If you agree, I would like to audio-record this interview for transcription and analysis.
