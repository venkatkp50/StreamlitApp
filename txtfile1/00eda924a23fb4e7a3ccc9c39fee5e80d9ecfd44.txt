Silver staining and mass spectrometry

For purification of the S2' protein fragment, 1x10 6 HEK293T cells transiently expressing S and ACE2 were co-cultured at 1:1 ratio in a T25 flasks. After incubation for 16 hours at 37 o C, syncytia lysates were washed once in cold PBS before lysed in NP-40 lysis buffer supplemented with 1x EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail. Post-nuclear syncytia lysates were incubated with 1.5 μg rabbit anti-S2 antibody for 1 hour at 4 o C, before immunoprecipitated with Protein A/G magnetic beads. Pull-down proteins were then washed, eluted and boiled in the 2 x Laemmli loading buffer.Total lysates (Input) and immunoprecipitates (IP) were separated by reducing SDS-PAGE on a 7.5% Tris-glycine gel before rinsed in fixation buffer (50% methanol 5% sodium acetate) for 20 min. The gel was sensitized in 0.02% sodium thiosulfate before reacted with 0.1% silver nitrate for 20 min. The gel was eventually developed in 2% sodium carbonate containing 0.045% formalin before rinsed and captured digitally; the S2' band was cut and subjected to in-gel digestion by 12.5 ng/μL trypsin in 25 mM NH 4 HCO 3 .Mass spectrometry (MS) analysis was performed by Shanghai Applied Protein Technology Co.Ltd. Briefly, a quadrupole Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Q Exactive) mass spectrometer coupled to Easy nLC (ThermoFisher) was operated in the positive ion mode. MS survey scans (300-1800 m/z) were obtained using the higher collision-energy dissociation (HCD) method in a datadependent acquisition mode. Normalized collision energy was 30 eV and the underfill ratio was set as 0.1%. The instrument was run with peptide recognition mode enabled. MS spectra were searched using MASCOT v2.2 (Matrix Science) against SARS-CoV-2 spike using the Uniprot reference P0DTC2; decoy hits were used to control the false discovery rate.Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy HEK293T cells were seeded overnight onto sterilized poly-D-lysine (100 ug/mL) (Sigma) treated 10 mm coverslips in 24-well plates at a density of 1.5 x 10 5 cells per well. After transfection with spike mutants, cells were washed with cold PBS once before fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20 min. Fixed cells were blocked in 1% (w/v) goat serum in PBS without membrane permeabilization. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 monoclonal antibody in 0.1% (w/v) goat serum in PBS was incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Coverslips were then washed 3 times with PBS before incubation with goat anti-mouse AlexaFluor555 secondary antibodies (ThermoFisher) for 1 hour at room temperature; secondary-antibody-only controls were performed. Coverslips were washed 3 times before being mounted in neutral mounting medium (Xinyu). Fluorescent images covering various areas on the coverslips were captured at 14-bit depth in monochrome using a 60x oil immersion objective on the Olympus FV-1200 inverted 4 Figure

Immunoblots showing the full-length S, S2, S2', ACE2 and tubulin detected from HEK293T cells from cell-cell fusion lysates, treated without or with 10 μg/mL trypsin for 3 and 6 hours using the system described in Figure 1G . Data are shown as individual points with mean ± SEM from five independent experiments. (D) Luciferase activity (RLU) detected from S-WT, S-R685A or S-R815A spike variants induced cell-cell fusion lysates in the absence or presence of 10 μg/mL trypsin for 6 hours, employing the system described in Figure 1G . Data are shown as individual points with mean ± SEM from five independent experiments. P values were obtained by one-way ANOVA with Sidak's post hoc test and are indicated on figures.
