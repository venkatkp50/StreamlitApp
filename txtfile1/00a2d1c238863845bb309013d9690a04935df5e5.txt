The secondary outcome was the association between immunosuppression or immunodeficiency and risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients.Two reviewers conducted study selection and data extraction. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or by a discussion with a third reviewer. The abstracted data included: first author, year of publication, country of the corresponding author, publication language, recruitment time frame, age and sex of patients, sample size, and outcomes of interest.Stata 13.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas, USA Stata) was used to estimate pooled odds risk (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes using the Mantel-Haenszel statistical method with the random-effects model. Statistical heterogeneity was evaluated using I 2 statistic, and values of < 25%, 26-50%, and > 50% considered as low, moderate, and high degrees of heterogeneity, respectively. Subgroup analysis was conducted for the primary outcome between different countries. We also performed sensitivity analyses by excluding studies published in Chinese to assess the stability of results.2176 records were obtained through systematic electronic searches. After screening titles, abstracts, and full texts, 8 studies 3-10 were included for analysis. All the included studies were published in 2020, incorporated a total of 4007 patients (2256 males) between December 11, 2019 and April 15, 2020. Two studies 3 , 9 published in Chinese, 6 studies 4-8 , 10 published in English, 7 studies 3-9 from China, and 1 10 study from the USA. The sample size per study ranged from 79 to 1,590 ( Table 1 ) .The meta-analysis showed that immunosuppression was associated with a 3.29-fold increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease (3 studies, 3-5 776 patients; OR = 3.29, 95%CI: 0.89 to 12.21, P = 0.075; I 2 = 5.5%), although the statistical difference was not significant ( Fig. 1 ). Sensitivity analysis indicated the result (OR = 4.32, 95%CI: 1.00 to 18.64) did not change substantially after excluding the Chinese study. 3 We found that immunodeficiency was associated with a 1.55-fold increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease (5 studies, 6-10 3,231 patients; OR = 1.55, 95%CI: 0.70 to 3.45, P = 0.285; I 2 = 0.0%), but the statistical difference was not significant ( Fig. 2 ) . Sensitivity analysis by excluding the Chinese study 9 showed a similar result (OR = 1.52, 95%CI: 0.67 to 3.47). The subgroup analysis based on countries indicated the association between immunodeficiency and severe COVID-19 disease in China (OR = 2.15, 95%CI: 0.50 to 9.22) was stronger than that in the USA (OR = 1.34, 95%CI: 0.51 to 3.50), Fig. 2 . One study 6 involving 1,590 patients reported the data on immunodeficiency between dead and surviving COVID-19 patients. The result revealed that there was no correlation ( P = 1.0 0 0) between immunodeficiency and the risk of death in patients with COVID-19.Our study showed that immunosuppression and immunodeficiency were associated with the increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease, although the statistical differences were not significant. These findings suggest that healthcare professionals need to be alert to the increased risk of serious diseases associated with COVID-19 infection in patients with immunosuppression and immunodeficiency/HIV.

Future researchers should focus on the treatment and management strategies for patients with immunosuppression and immunodeficiency/HIV during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the care and treatment strategies for COVID-19 patients with immunosuppression and immunodeficiency/HIV. However, our study was limited by small sample size, the results should be interpreted with caution. As more data becomes available, these findings should be reanalyzed to provide more reliable evidence.

ARTICLE IN PRESS

In conclusion, immunosuppression and immunodeficiency were associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease, although the statistical differences were not significant. Further high-quality studies are needed to provide robust evidence of the association between immunosuppression and immunodeficiency and COVID-19.
