BACKGROUND

Whooping cough (pertussis) is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by Bordetella Pertussis 1 2 . Despite a high vaccine coverage of third dose diphtheriatetanus-pertussis vaccine (DTP3) 3 , the "resurgence of pertussis" in recent years has posed a great threat to global public health [4] [5] [6] , as well as to Chinese infants 7 8 . The WHO estimates that pertussis kills about 160,700 children under 5 years old worldwide each year 9 . In China, three types of pertussis vaccines are available till March 31, 2021, i.e. the co-purified diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (cDTaP, used for routine immunization), DTaP/Hib (Minhai Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) 10 and DTaP-IPV/Hib (Sanofi Pasteur, Lyon, France) 11 12 . The coverage of DTP3 remained high above 99% for children throughout the 2010s 13 14 , but no school-age, adolescent or adult immunization (e.g. maternal vaccination) andpost-exposure prophylaxis are recommended in the country 15 . The reported incidence of pertussis has risen from 0.12 per 100,000 in 2013 to 2.14 per 100,000 in 2019 ( Figure 1 ). The rise was mainly concentrated in infants less than 1 year old (103.89 per 100,000 in 2019), and the underlying causes are unknown. It was suspected that multifactorial causes might have contributed to the rise 4 , e.g. the change of the wholecell pertussis vaccine to acellular vaccine in national immunization program 15 16 , the adaption of the bacterium to evade immunization induced by vaccine, the increased diagnosis with the introduction of the PCRs in clinical practices, the raised awareness of reporting in doctors, as well as the rise in circulation of the pathogen among older children, adolescents and adults whose immunity from vaccination or natural infection has waned 17 .Most epidemiological data on pertussis in China come from a passive reporting system, the National Notifiable Infectious Disease Surveillance System (NNIDSS) 18 . Because of limited diagnosis and incompleteness of reporting 8 19 20 , underreporting is substantial population-based studies can be used to strengthen the NNIDSS, by providing information on the burden of laboratory-confirmed pertussis, strains distribution, risk factors for severe sequelae and case fatality, and most importantly, to assist health authority in China to investigate the reasons behind the rising incidence of pertussis and prioritize health research investments and vaccine development.We designed the PertussisChina study, a one-year, prospective, age-stratified, population-based longitudinal cohort (active surveillance) and case-control study, which will enroll suspected pertussis patients (i.e. chronic/persistent cough) seeking healthcare in several selected participating hospitals (SHs) at two sites of China, covering approximately 2.23 million censused population. This article describes the study design, including sites selection, study population, case ascertainment and enrolment, control recruitment, follow-up of cases and controls, microbiological methods (i.e. culture, PCR, and serological tests), data collection, quality control activities, and statistical methods used to generate incidence estimates of pertussis.We then further discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the study design.

Objectives of the study

The primary objective of the study is to measure the incidence of laboratoryconfirmed pertussis by age groups (children, adolescents and adults), and by settings (community, outpatient and inpatient). The secondary objectives are: 1) to describe the distribution of disease severity and outcomes across age groups; 2) to describe the 

Site Selection Criteria

Sites are selected based on the following criteria: 1) have strong willingness to participate; 2) have capability and resources to conduct ongoing surveillance, namely staffs to facilitate specimen collection and case investigation, previous experience in disease surveillance, infrastructures to secure data collection and specimen storage or transportation; and 3) provide a full list of healthcare facilities in the area and the information of built-in hospital information system in the facilities. Currently, there are two sites in the study, including Yongcheng, Henan and Yiwu, Zhejiang ( Figure 2 ).

Study population

In 2019, Yiwu had a permanent population of 821,000 (47,000 were children under five years of age) served by 24 health care facilities. Most hospital admissions (≥80% of the total number) occurred in the three large tertiary hospitals, including a children's hospital and two general hospitals; meanwhile, Yongcheng had a permanent population of 1,411,000 (94,000 were children under five years of age) served by 41 health care facilities. Most hospital admissions occurred in the five large secondary hospitals, including four general hospitals and a maternal and pediatric hospital. In total, the two sites cover a total of 2.23 million permanent population in the study area.

Study overview and design

In order to achieve our study objectives, we will conduct the following study activities at the two sites from June 2021 through May 2022, including, 1) a Healthcare Utilization and Attitudes Survey (HUAS) and a census data updating to define study population (i.e. incidence denominator), so as to set up a sampling frame for the casecontrol study and selecting participating hospitals (i.e. SH) for case recruitment; 2) the case-control study to acquire the prevalence of B. pertussis infection among suspected pertussis cases and healthy controls, as well as the calculation of population attributable fraction (AF) indicating the proportion of cases that can be prevented if B. pertussis was totally removed from the population; and 3) the retrieval of electronic medical records (EMRs) from hospital information system to validate the number of suspected pertussis case patient (chronic/persistent cough) enrolled in SHs (i.e. incidence numerator) (Figure 3 ).

Census data updating

Population census data at the two sites will be collected and updated during the study period. Population census is conducted every ten years in China and the nearest one is in 2020. However, a intermittent survey of 1% sampling of the total population would be performed to update population census data every year between the two census. We will retain the up-to-date population data from the National Bureau of Statistics. Moreover, the population birth, mortality, and population migration is recorded by the local government. We will also contact the local health bureau quarterly to access these data to give a precise estimation of population size in the two sites.

Healthcare Utilization and Attitudes Surveys (HUAS)

HUAS will be conducted prior to recruiting cases and controls at the two sites, which will serve three purposes, 1) to set up a sampling frame for the case-control study ; 2) to select SHs in which prospective enrolment of cases will be conducted; and 3) to provide estimates of the population coverage for SHs and healthcare seeking behavior weights applied in estimating pertussis incidence.In summary, a population-based cross-sectional study, with an age-stratified sample of 3,000 children aged 0-59 mo and 6,000 adolescents/adults aged ≥5 years, will be conducted in the community of the two sites. The sample size was calculated based on: i) for children, a monthly prevalence of cough illness, π=1% (estimated from the reported incidence of lower respiratory tract infection of 0.15 per child year 21 ), allowable error (δ=0.5%), significant level (α=0.05), and design effect (deff=2); ii) and for adolescents/adults, a monthly prevalence of cough illness, π=3.3% 22 A complex sampling method will be used to select survey respondents as follows.Firstly, a probability proportionate to size sampling will be used to randomly select 50 clusters (e.g. communities or villages) in the site's administrative regions. At the second sampling stage in selected communities, quota sampling will be used to recruit interviewee. The quota required in each age stratum was calculated based on the age distribution of the population in the site and the number of surveys allocated to each cluster. Trained work staff will go to the selected communities to conduct face-to-face surveys at several locations (residential areas, kindergartens and children's vaccination clinics) Monday to Sunday during daytime in the study period. All residents living in the communities or villages for at least half a year prior to survey are eligible for and invited to participate in the interview. After the quota required in each age group is complete, the interviews will stop.The following questions (Supplementary table 1 & table 2 ) are asked to respondents, 1) the occurrence and length of cough illness in the previous month prior to survey, 2) healthcare-seeking behavior regarding the self-reported cough illness for the most recent episodes and the sources of healthcare facilities; and 3) the willingness to seek healthcare and where would they choose to visit for an assumptive cough illness.Based on the HUAS and census data, hospitals at which over 80% of respondents in each site choose to attend when hospital admission is required will be selected as our SHs. In case healthcare providers in the site change their practice or scope of service during our study period, for example the opening of new hospitals or the establishment of new branches of existing hospitals, an abbreviated HUAS with a smaller sample of 1,000 will be administered at the middle or the end of the year during which cases are recruiting at SHs. more of the following symptoms, 1) paroxysmal cough; 2) inspiratory whoop; or 3) post-tussive vomiting; Or, for children aged <1 years-old, cough (regardless of cough duration) accompanied by one or more of the following symptoms, 1) apnea; 2) paroxysmal cough; 3) inspiratory whoop; or 4) post-tussive vomiting.We will exclude patients presenting with gastroesophageal reflux, spastic bronchitis, and clearly diagnosed tuberculosis, mycoplasma/chlamydia infection, or chronic sinusitis. Adults/adolescents with a measured body temperature of ≥38.5 °C at enrolment will also be excluded.517 pertussis strains circulating in the population will be determined and characterized, 518 which are reported to be evolving under the selection pressure from both vaccine and 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 Infants less than one year old 1.cough (regardless of cough duration);

Sample Size Considerations

We planned to enroll approximately 250 suspected cases and 2 matched controls for each case in each age stratum (i.e. children under 5 years, and adolescents/adults aged ≥5 years) at each site, which would add up to approximately 1000 suspected cases and 2000 controls at the two sites. We calculated the above sample size based on a prevalence of B. pertussis in chronic/persistent cough of 20% (range=12%-32%) [23] [24] [25] , an allowable error of 5% and a significant level of 0.05. This sample size would have a 90% power (two sided α =0.05) to detect an odds ratio (OR) of 2 between case and control for a site and age stratum-specific comparison, if the true prevalence of B. pertussis is 20% in case; or an OR of 3, if the true prevalence is 10%. Although the carrier state of B. pertussis is transient in family contacts 26 27 , B. pertussis is rarely identified in healthy people 28 29 , and we expected a larger OR of ≥ 2 in the study. This sample size means that the laboratory would process average 115 samples per week, which is feasible and acceptable for our laboratories. Table 3 ). We planned to enroll all hospital admissions and the first 1-3 outpatients each week in each hospital. After obtaining informed consent, study staff will conduct enrollment interviews, and collect nasopharyngeal (N/P) and blood specimens for each enrolled case.

Controls selection

At the middle of the study year when the sample size of cases reaches a half of the total, a control is recruited in community of the study sites using approximate frequency matching, based on the following criteria, 1) similar proportion in sex strata;2) similar proportion in age strata, i.e. <1 year, 1-5 years, 6-19 years, 20-64 years and ≥65 years; 3) a control/case ratio of 2:1; and 4) no cough, running nose, shortness of breath, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms at enrolment nor have a record of healthcare for respiratory disease in previous 6 months before recruitment.

60-day follow-up of case

We will follow cases from the time of enrollment to a maximum time period of 60 days after enrollment. Follow-up will be conducted at 2 nd , 4 th and 8 th weeks after enrollment, with face-to-face interview if patient is currently hospitalized, or one telephone call each follow-up time if patient is discharged from hospital. At each follow-up visit/phone call, the study staff will ask about cough or other respiratory or systemic illness symptoms in the period since the last contact. If case is still symptomatic (cough) during follow-up, they will be encouraged to visit their doctor who enrolled them in the SHs within 24h of contact. The doctor will checkup the patient's health status and collect the swab and serum samples during the visit. If an enrolled patient does not want to visit the SHs, the study staff will arrange a household visit to collect the sample in the home.

Data collection from cases and controls

At enrolment, trained physicians and the study coordinator will conduct face-to-face Table 4 ). Demographic information includes household size (defined as a group of people who share a dinner   table) , average household income, rural or urban residence, age, alcohol consumption and smoking exposure, and occupation etc. A clinician will also examine all cases to document clinical signs and symptoms at enrollment, including cough characteristics [duration, paroxysms, post-tussive vomiting, exacerbation at night], body temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate, seizure, apnea, and other general respiratory symptoms, non-prescription antibiotic usage before visiting the doctor, blood test results and chest x-ray examinations. Vaccination history (i.e. band, dosing, procedure and time of administration) of children aged ≤14 years is also collected by linkage of his/her individual records on immunization in the national database (Childhood Immunization Information Management System,CIIMS) 30 or checking of vaccination certificate.During follow-up visits, data on any current cough or respiratory symptoms, subjective severity of illness, illness duration, functional impairment, whether medical care was sought, and outcomes since the last visits will be collected using CRFs (Supplementary   Table 5 ). At the end of follow-up, medical charts of each hospitalized case will be reviewed by study staff to collect information on antibiotic treatment and outcomes during hospitalization (i.e. mechanical ventilation, ICU transfer, and death) (Supplementary Table 6 ).

The retrieval of electronic medical records and Validation of the total number of suspected pertussis case

Since our case registry and enrolment is conducted in selective departments (i.e. respiratory, pediatric, infectious disease and emergency departments) and on workdays, it is essential that the total number of hospital admissions and outpatient/emergency department visits for chronic/persistent cough illness in the whole of hospital is retrieved from SH's EMRs, and used to validate the number of suspected pertussis case encountered in SH (i.e. the numerator of incidence).Specifically, all hospital discharges or ambulatory visits in SHs coded for diagnosis the records with the above diagnosis codes will be abstracted from hospital information system (HIS) of the SHs. This data will be validated by prospectively counting data in the selective departments that conduct case enrolment to make a precise estimate of the total number of chronic/persistent cough illness outcomes in the studied population. Namely, through linking and comparing between the number of registered cases and the number of suspected pertussis case patients enrolled in the selected departments, we will calculate the W case . With this W case , we will narrow down the ICD-based EMRs records to the total number of suspected pertussis cases in SHs.

Specimen collection and transport

When patients meet our suspected pertussis case definition or are recruited controls, they, as well as symptomatic (cough) cases during follow-up contacts, will be sampled within 24 hours. Physicians or nurses in SHs will be trained to collect nasopharyngeal swabs (N/P) and whole blood sample. Dacron or nylon swab will be used to collect N/P specimen to facilitate culture and PCR tests for B.pertussis 31 . Collected swab specimens will be plated onto selective agar or placed in transport medium (Charcoal Agar, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) immediately after sampling at the SHs. Whole blood without adding any anticoagulants (>4ml for participants aged 5 years and older, and ≥2 ml for children aged <5 years) will be collected, and centrifuged to separate serum within 24h of collection. All collected swab and sera samples will be transported 

Processing and storage of specimen

Upon arrival at the laboratory of China CDC, swab samples will be processed and prepared into three aliquots of swab supernatant, so will serum samples be. One of these aliquots will be analyzed and the other two aliquots will be kept for future analyses. All aliquots will be stored at -70°C temperature until the time of analysis.

Laboratory testing

In the laboratory of China CDC, Charcoal Agars will be cultured to isolate B. pertussis using standard method recommended by China CDC 32 and World Health Organization 33 . Swab supernatant will be analyzed for B. pertussis, B. parapertussis, B. bronchiseptica and B. holmesii using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as recommended by US CDC 34 35 . Sera samples that have a minimum volume of ≥ 1 ml will be tested for Anti-Ptx IgG titer using a commercially available diagnostic kit (Virion\Serion, Wurzburg, Germany) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. To validate our laboratory methods and testing results, external quality assurance testing will be conducted to reach agreements with a reference laboratory on Bordetellae prior to study start. For serology testing, we use standard from the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, London, UK, (https://www.nibsc.org/products/brm_product_catalogue/detail_page.aspx?catid=1 

Data flow, management and analysis

The data collected in the study are centrally managed at China CDC, using an online data platform (http://eddc.chinacdc.cn/dap/). The completed CRFs will be entered The entered records are regularly checked for completeness, consistency, and logical errors by data manager and the site's co-principle investigator who is responsible for authorization, integrity, security, and backup of database during data collection.

Statistical analysis

The collected data processing and key indicators based on which we calculate incidence are shown in figure 4. We will calculate the incidence of pertussis by age group and by settings with the following formula.Where, S i inpatient and S i outpatient indicates the registered number of inpatients and outpatient visits of cough illnesses at age group i, as obtained from HIS. is the weight used to adjust S i inpatient and S i outpatient to meet our case definition in age group i. This weight is calculated from the results of the prospective case-control study as a ratio of suspected pertussis cases over registered cases of cough illnesses at the selective departments of SHs. W sampling is the weight used to adjust holidays in which we do not conduct active case enrollment (we only conduct case enrollment in weekdays, not holidays). It is calculated as the total days that we conduct active study divided by 365.25 . N i is the population size in age group i in census year 2020. is the weight used to adjust catchment population overlapping between participating hospitals from HUAS in age group i. It is calculated as the ratio of inhabitants who actually have reported seeking medical care in the participating hospitals for the last episodes of their cough illness over the inhabitants who have the willingness of healthcare-seeking in the participating hospitals, as obtained from the HUAS study. C i is the proportion of population covered by participating hospitals in age group i, as The 95% CI of incidence is calculated with bootstrap method with 1000 replications.Besides incidence estimates, we will also explore factors associated with severe pertussis (defined as a composite outcome of death, sepsis, invasive ventilation and Intensive Care Unit transfer), by using multivariable logistic regression. Factors significantly associated with severe pertussis at p < 0.1 in univariate analysis will be included in the model. The median age of children with pertussis will be calculated by type of vaccinee, and factors predicting the age of pertussis breakthrough among children who had received DTP vaccination early in their life will be also studied by using Cox proportional hazards regression models.

ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION

This study is designed an observational study. The risk of harm is minimal and adverse medical events are not anticipated from the procedures involved in the study. The The primary risk to participants is the loss of confidentiality. To help maintain confidentiality, all study investigators will sign a confidentiality agreement and receive appropriate ethics training. All interviews will be conducted at the study investigator's office, and signed consent forms and completed survey forms will be locked in a secure file cabinet at the end of each day. A very limited number of trained study staff can have the key to the locked file cabinets. Participation in every aspect of the study will be voluntary, and for all new data collection, participants will be asked to provide written informed consent. Besides, collection of specimens may cause mild discomfort to the subject during the procedure, especially drawing blood from young children. To minimize invasive procedures during sample collection, swab and blood specimens will be collected by aseptic technique and we encourage the use of leftover sera during routine medical care at the time point of enrolment.As a benefit of participating in the study, participants with pertussis will receive senior doctor consultation during treatment on how to limit transmissions among family members and co-workmates; Patients enrolled in the study will have access to antibiotic susceptibility testing results should they have B. pertussis isolates acquired.This will give a guide on empirical antibiotic usages for physicians; moreover, the data generated in the study will be valuable to determine the burden of pertussis and explore risk factors for illness attributable to severe pertussis in children as well as

Methods and analysis 34 This paper describes the study design of a one-year, prospective, age-stratified, and 35 population-based case-control study, including site selection, study population, case registry, 36 ascertainment and enrolment, control recruitment, follow-up of case, microbiological 37 methods, data collection, quality control activities, and statistical methods used to generate 38 incidence estimates. During June 2021 through May 2022, registry of suspected pertussis 39 cases (namely chronic/persistent cough) will be conducted in several participating hospitals 40 (SHs) at the two sites, which are selected based on Healthcare Utilization and Attitudes 41 Surveys (HUAS) carried out before study initiation. A case-control study will be conducted in 42 the SHs and we aim to enroll a total of 1,000 suspected pertussis cases (i.e. all hospital 43 admissions and the first 1-3 outpatient visits each week each hospital) and 2,000 frequency 44 matched healthy controls in community. Our primary study outcome, the laboratory- 45 confirmed Bordetella Pertussis infection, will be determined by a comprehensive laboratory 46 methods and procedures (i.e. culture, PCR, and serological tests) in both cases and controls at 47 enrolment and during 60-day's follow-up visits. Finally, data from HUAS (i.e. population size), 48 case registry (i.e. the total number of suspected pertussis cases), and case-control study (i.e. 49 the prevalence or population attributable fraction of Bordetella Pertussis) will be combined to 50 calculate incidence and its 95% confidence interval through bootstrap method. 51 Epidemiological analyses will be conducted to determine the risk factors associated with 52 severe sequelae of pertussis.Methods and analysis 34 This paper describes the study design of a one-year, prospective, age-stratified, and 35 population-based case-control study, including site selection, study population, case registry, 36 ascertainment and enrolment, control recruitment, follow-up of case, microbiological 37 methods, data collection, quality control activities, and statistical methods used to generate 38 incidence estimates.

Objectives of the study 125 The primary objective of the study is to measure the incidence of laboratory- case registry and the retrieval of electronic medical records (EMRs) from hospital 165 information system to provide and validate the total number of suspected pertussis 166 case patient (chronic/persistent cough) encountered in the SHs (i.e. incidence 167 numerator) (Figure 3 ).Objectives of the study 125 The primary objective of the study is to measure the incidence of laboratory- In order to achieve our study objectives, we will conduct the following study activities Defining and calibrating study population 169 Census data updating 170 Population census data at the two sites will be collected and updated during the study 171 period. Population census is conducted every ten years in China and the nearest one 172 is in 2020. However, an intermittent survey of 1% sampling of the total population 173 would be performed to update population census data every year between the two 174 censuses. We will retain the up-to-date population data from the National Bureau of 175 Statistics. Moreover, the population birth, mortality, and population migration are 176 recorded by the local government. We will also contact the local health bureau 177 quarterly to access these data to give a precise estimation of population size in the 178 two sites. 180 HUAS will be conducted prior to recruiting cases and controls at the two sites, which 181 will serve three purposes, 1) to set up a sampling frame for the case-control study; 2) 182 to select SHs in which prospective enrolment of cases will be conducted; and 3) to 183 provide estimates of the population coverage for our SHs and healthcare seeking 184 behavior weights applied in estimating pertussis incidence in community. 185 In summary, a population-based cross-sectional study, with an age-stratified sample 186 of 3,000 children aged 0-59 mo and 6,000 adolescents/adults aged ≥5 years, will be 187 conducted in the community of the two sites. The sample size was calculated based A complex sampling method will be used to select survey respondents as follows. 194 Firstly, a probability proportionate to size sampling will be used to randomly for and invited to participate in the interview. After the quota required in each age 204 group is complete, the interviews will stop. 205 The following questions (Supplementary table 1 & table 2 ) are asked to respondents, duration) accompanied by one or more of the following symptoms, 1) apnea; 2) 224 paroxysmal cough; 3) inspiratory whoop; or 4) post-tussive vomiting. 225 We will exclude patients presenting with gastroesophageal reflux, spastic bronchitis, 226 and clearly diagnosed tuberculosis, mycoplasma/chlamydia infection, or chronic 227 sinusitis. Adults/adolescents with a measured body temperature of ≥38.5 °C at 228 enrolment will also be excluded. Processing and storage of specimen 341 Upon arrival at the laboratory of China CDC, swab samples will be processed and 342 prepared into three aliquots of swab supernatant, so will serum samples be. One of 343 these aliquots will be analyzed and the other two aliquots will be kept for future The primary risk to participants is the loss of confidentiality. To help maintain evidence on disease burden of pertussis, this study will focus on age-specific incidence 469 based on laboratory confirmation and will fill the data gaps on prospectively and 470 actively collected incidence data and key information on illness severity and outcomes. 471 We are expecting that data from this study can be served as background information comparing between data generated from HUAS in community and case registry in SHs, 483 we will able to measure incidence by settings (i.e. community, outpatient and 484 inpatient), especially those in communities whose symptoms are mild or atypical after 485 the waning of vaccine-induced immunity or those no healthcare are sought 2 . Besides, 486 all hospitalizations suspected of pertussis will be actively searched and prospectively 487 enrolled in a timely manner in our SHs, serving as a complete and representative Finally, we will abstract EMR data from hospital information system, which serves as 508 a complete and accurate record of cough illness outcomes occurred in SHs. The 509 retrospectively collected EMR data will be validated by prospectively counting cases 510 eligible for inclusion at selective departments of SHs on daily basis. Using data from 511 the EMR will allow us to determine the size of outpatient and emergency department 512 visits for cough illness in the studied population. For most of adults and fully 513 immunized children and adolescents, their illness is generally mild and is most likely 514 to be encountered at the ambulatory settings in which the diagnostic capacity is 515 generally lacking. 516 Aside from acquiring incidence estimates, the prevalence and distribution of B.

We aim to estimate the health burden of laboratory-confirmed pertussis by 31 age groups, considering the setting of illness onset (i.e. in community, outpatient and 32 inpatient), in a Chinese population (~2.23 million in total) at two sites.
