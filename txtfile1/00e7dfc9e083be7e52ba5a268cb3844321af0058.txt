Page 2 of 17 chemistry at the ground level atmosphere is well understood (e.g., Atkinson, 2000; Crutzen, 1974; Seinfeld & Pandis, 2016) . NO x and VOC are primary species that originate from natural and anthropogenic sources such as vehicular traffic and industrial fossil fuel burning, and through episodic events like biomass burning and volcanoes (e.g., Barletta et al., 2002; Khillare et al., 2005 Khillare et al., , 2008a Khillare et al., , 2008b Hoque et al., 2008; Li et al., 2017; Ling et al., 2014; Sillman, 1999; Srivastava et al., 2006; Steinbrecher et al., 2009) . Ozone is formed through the photolysis of NO 2 and has a comparatively short lifetime in the air. However, its precursors can remain in the atmosphere for many days continuously forming ozone and resulting in long-range (often transboundary) transport (Wild et al., 2004; Young et al., 2013) . Photochemical ozone production also occurs in rural and remote locations and in remote unpolluted areas (Crutzen, 1974 ). Surface O 3 shows explicit diel and seasonal variations, which are governed by the photochemistry of its production and removal (Debaje et al., 2003; Lal et al., 2000; Zhao et al., 2021) . Highly reactive hydroxyl ( • OH) and nitrate (NO 3 • ) radicals are the important oxidative species in the troposphere during day and night, respectively. They are formed through reactions of O 3 (e.g., Aschmann et al., 2002; Atkinson et al., 1995) . The • OH radical is the key species which initiates reactions of hydrocarbons (HC) and CO during the day, and in the process highly oxidizing peroxy radicals like HOO • , alkyl peroxy radical (ROO • ), and acyl peroxy radical (RC(O)OO • ) are formed. These peroxy radicals compete with O 3 to oxidize NO to NO 2 leading to a situation where more O 3 is formed than is consumed. This process leads to the built up of O 3 during the day.Two discrete regimes govern the ground level atmospheric ozone: (i) NO x -sensitive regime, when the production of O 3 is sensitive to the concentration of NO x, and (ii) VOC-sensitive regime, when the increase in the concentration of O 3 is a function of the concentration of VOC (Sillman, 1995; Finlayson-Pitts, 1999; Seinfeld & Pandis, 2016) . If controls are applied to the wrong precursor, the O 3 concentrations can rise as has been seen in many places around the world since the COVID-19 pandemic led to substantial reductions in NO emissions in VOC-limited regions (e.g., Sicard et al., 2020; Sulaymon et al., 2021; Torkmahalleh et al., 2021) .Ground level atmospheric O 3 also affects carbon dynamics, ecological interconnections, and agricultural efficiency across the ecosphere (Schneider et al., 2017) . High O 3 levels can lead to the closure of stomata, thereby reducing the uptake of gases affecting photosynthesis (Karnosky et al., 2003) . Later, Ghude et al. (2014) reported reductions of crop yield in India due to surface ozone and, therefore, an agricultural economy like India's cannot ignore O 3 pollution.Surface ozone is also an important greenhouse gas contributing to global warming and climate change (IPCC, 2013; Kulkarni et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2020) . The concentration of O 3 is changing in the global scale leading to an increase in the background concentrations, which influence the levels of local concentrations of O 3 and NO 2 (Clapp & Jenkin, 2001) . There are reports of reduction of particulate pollution but O 3 remained constant or increasing, indicating the complexities in the O 3 pollution and, therefore, its control (e.g., Squizzato et al., 2018) .Ozone in the lower atmosphere is termed as "bad" O 3 for its adverse effects on human health and the environment. It was termed as lung irritant soon after its discovery (Bates, 1989) . Health effects of increased concentration of O 3 include reduction of lung functions, increased respiratory problems, and inflammation. Long-term exposure of O 3 ultimately leads to chronic damage of the lungs in vertebrates (Lippmann, 1991) . Ozone exposure can decrease the variability in heart rate of human beings thereby deteriorating the cardiac autonomic nervous system (Jia et al., 2011) . The cardiovascular effects of ambient O 3 are found in animals, when exposed for a long duration, thereby altering their vascular tone (Chuang et al., 2009; Paffett et al., 2015; Robertson et al., 2013) .There has been limited literature addressing O 3 from India. More so, the reported studies are generally from major metropolitan areas, at sites that are often heavily influenced by local sources like traffic (e.g., Badarinath et al., 2009a Badarinath et al., , 2009b Beig et al., 2013; Ganguly & Tzanis, 2013; Lal et al., 2012; Singla et al., 2011) . There are a few studies on the ground level atmospheric O 3 from the Brahmaputra Valley region (e.g., Bharali et al., 2015; Bhuyan et al., 2014; Dumka et al., 2020; Pathak et al., 2016) . Tyagi et al. (2020) parameters. They concluded that there is significant transport of O 3 to the region; however, they did not address the air mass trajectory pathways/regions that contributed to higher O 3 . Therefore, this study was taken up to determine the variability of ground level O 3 on a daily and seasonal basis in a relatively rural area of the mid-Brahmaputra Valley. Ozone has been assessed in terms of the NO x -O 3 photostationary state to understand the processes that are driving the O 3 concentration. Concentration-weighted trajectory (CWT) analysis was done to identify likely source regions from where air masses carrying precursors originated and were subsequently transported to the region contributing to the formation of O 3 .

The site

Ozone, NO and NO 2 , and meteorological variables were measured on the Tezpur University campus (26° 37′ N and 92° 50′ E) under the MAPAN (monitoring of atmospheric pollution and networking) program. The location of the study area along with illustrative air mass back trajectories during winter is shown in Supplemental Fig. S1 . The diel patterns' atmospheric temperature through the year over the study area is shown in Fig. S2 . The site is characterized as a rural residential/institutional area. The station is surrounded by villages and agricultural fields. Tezpur city had a population of about 2.0 million (Census of India, 2011). The moderately busy highways are at about 20 km and the eastern Himalayan ranges begin at 30 km on the north from the monitoring station. The region is still developing. Traditional biomass burning in homes, agriculture, and forest are seen in the surrounding areas of the study site previously reported by Bhuyan et al. (2018) .

Methodology

Continuous hourly measurements of O 3 , NO, and NO 2 and meteorological parameters for two consecutive years (2013-14 and 2014-15) were used for the study. The O 3 measurements were made with a Serinus 10 ozone analyzer (Ecotech) . This analyzer uses non-dispersive ultraviolet (UV) absorption technology to measure O 3 with a sensitivity of 0.5 ppb and in the range of 0-20 ppm (Ecotech user manual, 2010; Dumka et al., 2020) . The measurements of NO and NO 2 were made with a Serinus 40 Oxides of Nitrogen analyzer (Ecotech) that uses gas phase chemiluminescence detection. The concentration of NO x is the sum of the concentrations of NO and NO 2 .This Serinus 40 analyzer measures with a sensitivity of 0.4 ppb with auto ranging of 0-20 ppm (Ecotech, 2011; Gilge, 2010; Yadav et al., 2014) . Another important parameter estimated in this study was total oxidant (OX = O 3 + NO 2 ) that assists in understanding the O 3 behavior. Hourly average measurements of meteorological variables were made at the same station. The four seasons considered in the study were as per the India Meteorological Department (Laskar et al., 2016.) : pre-monsoon (March-May), monsoon (June-September), post-monsoon (October-December), and winter (January-February).The R package, Openair (Carslaw, 2018; Carslaw & Ropkins, 2012) was used for analyses and illustrations and in computing the polar plots. The air mass back trajectories were computed using Tra-jStat software that applies NOAA/ARL HYSPLIT (Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) model to calculate back trajectories. The NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis data (ftp:// arlftp. arlhq. noaa. gov/ pub/ archi ves/ reana lysis) were used to compute 72 h (3 days) back trajectories arriving at the site every hour (Draxler & Hess, 1998; Rolph et al., 2017; Stein et al., 2015) . The time difference between UTC and local time was carefully adjusted so that the time of the measurement of concentration and the time of reaching the trajectory matched.Concentration-weighted trajectory (CWT) analysis was applied where trajectories were weighted with associated concentrations. Each grid was assigned a residence-time-weighted concentration from the measured data associated with the trajectories that crossed that grid cell, as follows:where, C ij -average weighted concentration in the ijth cell.l -index of the trajectory.(1) M -total number of trajectories. C l -concentration observed on arrival of trajectory l.τijl -time spent in the ijth cell by trajectory l. In the cases of higher C ij , it could be inferred that air masses that passed over the ijth cell were transporting that species leading to high concentrations at the receptor site. To reduce the effect of a small number of polluted trajectories, a weighting function was multiplied with the CWT . Low NO x and comparatively high O 3 are typical of remote locations where the production of O 3 is mainly governed by the NO x concentration (Chameides et al., 1992) . However, in a high NO x regime like an urban area, the production of O 3 is controlled by NO x and VOC levels (Chameides et al., 1992; Sillman et al., 1990) .

Concentrations

A summary of O 3 concentrations from the present study and related studies is provided in Table 1 The hour of the week of O 3 concentrations in the year 2014 (January to December)) are shown in Fig. 2A .The hour of the week plot generally showed O 3 trends with single peak (maximum ozone) during the afternoons. The diel pattern of O 3 in 2014 is shown in Fig. 2B that shows a clear afternoon peak. This pattern is different from the trends of urban areas where the maximum ozone is experienced at midday (e.g., Dumka et al., 2020; Han et al., 2011; Reddy et al., 2012; Yadav et al., 2014) . The diel O 3 concentration variation followed the progression of temperature during the day shown in Fig. S2 . Increased O 3 concentrations have been reported to follow the increase in atmospheric temperature (AT) (e.g., Coates et al., 2016) . Temperature affects the O 3 formation by speeding up the rates of chemical reactions, e.g., O 3 + NO + hv → NO 2 + O is a function of temperature, which is the reaction that leads to the formation of O 3 by reaction with O 2 . AT also increases the rate of emission of biogenic VOCs (Sillman & Samson, 1995) as well as the evaporative emission of VOCs (Rubin et al., 2006 ). The O 3 distributions across the days of the week (Fig. 2C ) showed a small rise in the concentrations during Monday, Thursday, and Friday with the concentrations decreasing only marginally on Tuesday, Wednesday, and during the weekends. Higher O 3 is observed on weekends due to reduction of NO x emissions on weekends in a VOC-limited regime (Cleveland et al., 1974; Sicard et al., 2020; Wolff et al., 2013) . The occurrence of higher levels of O 3 is termed as the "weekend effect." The • OH radical initiated reactions of VOC play a key role here and a significant lowering of NO x makes more • OH available to initiate the oxidation of VOCs leading to an increase in the ozone formation (Fujita et al., 2003) . Also, the lack of titration of O 3 and the ability of the peroxides and peroxy radicals to cycle the NO more rapidly to the NO 2 to be photolyzed allows the formation of additional O 3 . Alternatively, lower weekend O 3 concentrations could be the result of NO x reduction in a NO x -limited regime.The month-to-month O 3 pattern in 2014 is shown in Fig. 2D . It clearly shows pre-monsoon (April) O 3 concentrations maxima at this site (e.g., Crutzen, 1988; Dumka et al., 2020; Gilge et al., 2010; Yadav et al., 2014) . The monthly average AT in the study area has been presented in Fig. S2(b) . The maximum average monthly AT across the study region was seen during July-August. However, the ozone maxima were found during April when the temperatures were warm (20 to 30 °C) and enhanced photochemical reactions. Although AT has a role in increasing the O 3 formation through increasing the rate constants for important reaction, temperature also enhances the rates of biogenic emission of VOCs (e.g., Coates et al., 2016; Gu et al., 2020; Rubin et al., 2006; Sillman & Samson, 1995) . The time series plots of the concentrations of O 3 , NO x , NO 2 , and NO of the study period are given in Fig. S3 . The pre-monsoon maximum of O 3 is clearly seen in these plots. However, maximum NO x concentration was observed in the winter months. The meteorological conditions during the pre-monsoon favored the rise of O 3 concentration. The maximum concentration of O 3 was seen in the month of April when plants start growing strongly and emit more reactive VOCs. In this region, March-April are the main foliating months in the forests and tea plantations, which would lead to elevated emission of biogenic VOCs (BVOC) and impacting the O 3 formation (e.g., Wu et al., 2020) . Also, there are controlled burning fires in the forests for management (Badarinath et al., 2009a) . These fires emit large quantities of reactive organic compounds that also interact with the NO x chemistry and O 3 formation (Singh et al., 1995) . Previously, Tyagi et al. (2020) examined O 3 with respect to AT of three stations in the northeastern India and did not find a dependency of O 3 on temperature. They inferred this discrepancy to the transport of O 3 into the region. However, the role of VOCs of both biogenic and anthropogenic origins cannot be overlooked in the present study.

Diel patterns of O 3 and O 3 -NO x photostationary state

The O 3 -NO x relationship can be explained by the following reactions after Leighton (1961) :Daytime O 3 , NO 2 , and NO equilibrate on a timescale of a few minutes (Clapp & Jenkin, 2001) to reach a "dynamic" equilibrium called the "photostationary state" (PS), wherein d[O 3 ] / dt = 0 (Seinfeld & Pandis, 2016) . If J 1 is the rate of the photodissociation of NO 2 including the light intensity (Eq. 2) and k 3 is the rate coefficient of the formation of NO 2 (Eq. 4), then the PS can be explained by the ratio J 1 /k 3 = [O 3 ] [NO] / [NO 2 ], which will govern the concentrations of O 3 , NO 2 , and NO during the day. J 1 is a function of solar intensity so it includes a diel variability whereas k 3 is a function of temperature. The k 3 varies with temperature as given by Seinfeld and Pandis (2016) :However, the accumulation of O 3 in the lower atmosphere is more complicated, and reactions that convert NO to NO 2 with no-or-less destruction of O 3 are required for O 3 to accumulate. Ozone reacts with olefins to form Criegee intermediates that can decompose to produce • OH and peroxy radicals. The • OH radicals oxidize other VOCs and CO to form additional oxidizing radicals like HOO • and ROO • . These oxidants convert NO to NO 2 without the destruction of and O 3 (Eq. 4) as outlined in (Eq. 6) to (Eq. 11) (Atkinson, 2000; Greiner, 1967; Stedman et al., 1970) : There are external factors that can affect the PS including transport of O 3 , the nature and concentrations of VOCs, alternate generation of peroxy radicals such as photolysis of short-chin carbonyls, and local sources and transport of NO x (Khalil, 2018) . Due to these complexities, a "true" PS is rarely attained in the ground level atmosphere.Thus, the net O 3 (measured O 3 concentration) and J 1 /k 3 were plotted against time of day for the differentseasons to ascertain how the temporal variation of O 3 behaved relative to J 1 /k 3 (Fig. 3) . The net O 3 and J 1 /k 3 attained a maximum during midday to the early afternoon hours, and then both parameters declined as the day progressed.During the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons (Fig. 3a, b) , the net O 3 and J 1 /k 3 attained their maxima and were about equal during midday to afternoon (1130 h to 1530 h local time). In this period, much of the NO 2 has photolyzed to give O 3 , and the net O 3 was a function of NO x . These two seasons are much warmer seasons compared to the post-monsoon and winter periods, and the days are longer. Maximum sunshine and temperature occur during that time period (1130 h to 1530 h). It was also interesting to see that the maxima were attained long after the sunrise, which is the high traffic period of the morning hours.During post-monsoon and winter seasons (Fig. 3c,  d) , the net O 3 and J 1 /k 3 peaked for a shorter duration at around 14:00 local time. During the post-monsoon net O 3 and J 1 /k 3 were nearly equal at ~ 1400 h local time. However, during the winter, net O 3 and J 1 /k 3 never became equal. During the peak hour, the levels of net O 3 were much higher than the J 1 /k 3 during the winter month.During all the seasons, the ratio (J 1 /k 3 ) and net O 3 fell after the peak. The slopes of net O 3 and J 1 /k 3 were not similar. The fall in the case of J 1 /k 3 was much sharper than net O 3 and the levels of net O 3 remained higher than the ratio during the rest of the day. Also, net O 3 was found to be higher than J 1 /k 3 during the period preceding the peak period. During the winter season, the net O 3 was always much higher than J 1 /k 3 This discrepancy points at the factors that cause deviations of net O 3 from the PS. Those factors include transport of O 3 and the role of VOCs. The activity of VOC and involvement of OH are local (Khalil, 2018) , and OH generation and reactions of VOC degradation and production of O 3 in the process happens in situ. However, the VOCs and NO x could be from both local emission and long-range transport.The local sources of elevated levels of VOCs were biomass burning and biogenic emissions. The longrange transport of peroxyacyl nitrate (PAN) and other PAN homologues from the IGP can add NO x and radicals in the region during the winter, which are important drivers of O 3 production.Though biomass burning is prevalent in the region (Deka & Hoque, 2015) , during the winter months, there is escalation in the biomass burning which is a major source of VOCs in the atmosphere. A unique festive biomass burning, locally known as meji burning during mid-January each year is a major emitter of particulate matter and gases (Deka & Hoque, 2014; Hoque & Deka, 2010) that also have implications on the oxidative behavior of the regional atmosphere and O 3 buildup in the winter period.Biomass burning emits loads of oxygenated hydrocarbons like aldehydes, ketones, and alcohol which are important sources of free radicals linked with the reactivity of NO x and ozone formation. Acetone alone can provide a high production of HO x ( • OH and HOO • ) radicals thereby enhancing the production of O 3 (Singh et al., 1995) . The alcohols also further undergo oxidation giving rise more reactive aldehydes and radicals that would favor O 3 formation explained by the following reaction (Singh et al., 1995) :Another important source of VOC in the winter months is agriculture. The whole of the Brahmaputra Valley region is widely cultivated with crops from the Brassicaceae family that are known to emit volatile organics (Gan et al., 1998; Mead et al., 2008) . Rapeseed, cabbage, and radish are principal winter crops of the Brahmaputra Valley. There is a large area (0.276 million ha) under rapeseed cultivation (Das, 2015) . Even the fallow lands are used for rapeseed since it is a hardy crop and does not need irrigation and excessive manuring. Similarly, large areas are under cabbage (33.24 kha) and radish (21.17 kha) (Horticulture Statistics Division, 2018). The Brassicaceae family is known to emit large volumes of CH 3 Br and other organics (Gan et al., 1998; Mead et al., 2008) . CH 3 Br is a reactive gas and provides a source of radicals that covert NO to NO 2 and enhance the production of O 3 (Orlando et al., 1996) , shown in Eqs. 14-16:PAN is a source of NO x and organic radicals in the remote atmosphere. The thermochemical stability of PAN depends on the temperature and is quite stable at low temperature. At 7 °C and NO 2 /NO ratio of 2-20, the lifetime of PAN (τ PAN ) is ~ 19 to 120 h, and at 27 °C, τ PAN is ~ 0.75 h to 4.4 h (Altshuller, 1993) . Other PANs have similar lifetimes. Therefore, at low temperatures, PAN can be transported long-range and pump in NO x and organic radicals to the remote regions. Analysis of the air mass back trajectories reaching the site during winter (Fig. S1 ) suggests that 28% of the trajectories traveled from the IGP region of India. The IGP is one of the most polluted regions of India from where aided by the low temperatures, there was likely transport to the study area of PAN. As the trajectories reached the site where the temperature is 10 °C to 24 °C in the winter, the PAN decomposed to NO x and organic radicals (Eq. 17): The ventilation coefficients (VC) calculated for winter month (January) as mixed layer height (MLH) × wind speed (WS), as illustrated in Fig. 4 show that the maximum VC is experienced at ~ 9:00 the morning and that is, then, there was a steep rise in the winter period concentration of net O 3.

Transport of O 3

Transport of O 3 also has a greater implication in the deviation of PS as seen in the period before and after the peak O 3 time of the day, wherein the O 3 concentrations were always higher than the ratio (J 1 /k 3 ). The transport of O 3 to the station was examined by comparing (i) the polar plots of O 3 and NO 2 (for local transport) and (ii) the concentration-weighted trajectories (CWT) of O 3 (for regional transport representing the precursors like PAN). The polar plots of NO 2 were considered because O 3 is ultimately produced (through all photochemical processes) from the photolysis of NO 2 . If O 3 was to be produced only from the photolysis of NO 2 , the polar plots of O 3 and NO 2 would look similar. The polar plots of O 3 and NO 2 are given in Fig. 5 , in which the concentrations are plotted against wind speed and wind direction.Through the seasons, high O 3 concentrations were found to accompany high wind speed that suggests transport of O 3 to the site (Fig. 5a-d) . However, stagnant conditions would also allow locally emitted NO to titrate the O 3 . Alternatively, higher concentrations of NO 2 were observed under lower wind speeds (Fig. 5e-h) . Only moderate and low levels of NO 2 were associated with high wind speeds indicating that the NO x was locally emitted and dispersed under higher ventilation conditions. It is clear from the plots that higher O 3 and higher NO 2 were seen to be associated with winds from different directions. It was important to look at the polar plots of the winter season (Fig. 5d, h) . As discussed in the previous section, in the winter season, O 3 did not show a diel pattern corresponding to J 1 /k 3 (PS), and the O 3 concentration was much higher than J 1 /k 3 . The polar plot of O 3 in winter shows that O 3 was higher when the wind speeds were high, a pattern that is different from the polar plot of NO 2 . The wind directions with respect to high ozone and the direction with respect to high NO 2 were found to be different, which may be inferred as transport of O 3 to the site. There are previous reports that during the winter and pre-monsoon seasons, the region receives air mass trajectories that originated and/ or passed over the IGP Deka et al., 2020) and bring high pollutant concentrations to the region (Ommi et al., 2017; Rahman et al., 2020) . The HYSPLIT air mass trajectories reaching the site were weighted with the concentrations of O 3 , and the CWTs were computed (Fig. 6) . It was clear from the CWT plot that when the trajectories originated or passed over the IGP, the Indian Himalayan region including Nepal, Bangladesh, and the Bay of Bengal, the site experienced higher O 3 concentrations (shown as colors above yellow). Moderate concentrations of O 3 (color codes green to yellow) were observed when the trajectories originated or passed over Myanmar, the Shillong Plateau, and the western regions of China. These results suggest that the O 3 concentrations are strongly affected when the trajectories originated or traveled over polluted regions transporting O 3 precursors such as PAN to the area.

Conclusions

Ambient O 3 concentrations of mid-Brahmaputra Valley showed vivid diel, monthly, and seasonal variations, which is not unusual. Ozone concentrations through days and seasons do vary and should vary. However, the behavior of O 3 against the PS varied among seasons and O 3 of the days of the winter period deviated from the PS substantially. This deviation can be attributed to local emissions from biomass burning, VOCs from both biogenic and anthropogenic emissions, and long-range transport of O 3 precursors in the form of PAN and PAN homologues.
