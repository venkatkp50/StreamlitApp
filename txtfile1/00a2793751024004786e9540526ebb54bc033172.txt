INTRODUCTION

The incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) has been rising steadily over the past few decades and the resulting burden of disease is an issue faced by developed and developing countries alike 1 . Because the established biological and medical risk factors cannot fully explain the occurrence of CHD-related adverse cardiac events, we propose that psychological and social factors play an important and independent role in the development of coronary heart disease 2-3 .Psychological stress (stress) refers to the psychological challenge or threat caused by various triggering events or adverse life factors, and usually manifests as emotional discomfort, pain, or anguish 4 . Under normal circumstances, a dynamic equilibrium exists between an organism and its external environment, and stress arises when this equilibrium is upset or is self-perceived as upset 5 . Stress is believed to be closely linked to the occurrence and development of cardiovascular disease, one of the most important psychosomatic diseases 6 . Although the biological mechanisms remain unclear, the current literature suggests that self-perceived stress may cause over-activation of the autonomic nervous system and elicit a stress response from the endocrine system, thereby inducing endothelial dysfunction, ultimately triggering cardiovascular events 7 . However, the process by which stressors exert their effects on an organism is not linear; instead, it arises through interactions 5 . The stress perceived by an individual reflects his/her subjective evaluation of the stressor and will partly depend on individual attributes. Studies have shown that different individuals faced with identical stressors may perceive considerably different levels of stress, with different effects on CHD occurrence and development, resulting in differences in the severity or prognosis of CHD 8 . Therefore, the accurate identification of high-stress individuals is of great significance for the precise assessment and subsequent treatment of CHD. deviation (x ± s); variables not normally distributed were expressed as median and interquartile range (IQR). Qualitative data were expressed as ratios or percentages.Factors associated with the CPSS scores of the study participants were analyzed from binary logistic regression.

Patient and public involvement

Public and patient involvement was not applicable in this research.

Demographic data of patients with CHD

Of the 3845 patients referred to the cardiac rehabilitation clinic during the study period, 2215 had CHD and were eventually included in the study. The mean age of the study participants was 59.57 ± 10.10 y, and the majority of the participants were male (79.64%), had a university degree or below (94.13%), married (99.05%), had children (97.97%), engaged in mental labor (69.07%), had sleep disorders (74.81%), and did not have a drinking habit (60.18%) Of the participants, 77.1% had previously undergone stent insertion, 56.2% had concomitant hypertension, 47.4% had concomitant hyperlipidemia, and 27% had concomitant diabetes mellitus (see Table 1 ).

Comparison of characteristics between groups

The mean CPSS score of all the patients with CHD was 27.16 ± 6.35. Using the median score of 27 as the cut-off point, the study participants were divided into a low- Participants who engaged in mental labor had a higher probability of high perceived stress than those who engaged in manual labor (OR: 1.389, CI: 1.144-1.686). Compared with participants who did not have a habit of risky alcohol consumption, those who had this habit had a higher probability of high perceived stress (OR:1.492, CI: 1.146-1.944) (see Table 3 ).

DISCUSSION

The relationship between psychological stress and cardiovascular disease has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Considering that psychological stress may play some role in the occurrence and development of CHD, a greater emphasis has been placed on stress management in comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation programs because it may potentially provide benefits, such as improving the long-term prognosis of patients with CHD 14 . Therefore, recent models of comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation require cardiac rehabilitation specialists to accurately assess and identify high-stress individuals for targeted, stratified management. The mean CPSS score of Chinese patients with CHD in our study was 27.16 ± 6.35, which was slightly higher than that of the normal population 11 . In addition, we found that patients who had higher educational attainment, engaged in mental labor, had children, and had a habit of risky alcohol consumption perceived higher levels of stress.Analysis of the demographic characteristics of high-stress individuals among patients with CHD can support the clinical stratified management of patients according to stress level, which increases the efficiency of rehabilitation treatment and maximizes the clinical benefits to each individual.Our results showed a strong correlation between perceived stress and educational level in Chinese patients with CHD. A higher educational level was associated with F o r p e e r r e v i e w o n l y higher perceived stress, with the risk of high perceived stress in participants with a university degree being 1.453 times (CI: 1.206-1.750) that of those who received senior middle school education or below, and the OR increased to 1.928 (CI: 1.290-2.882) among participants with a masters or doctoral degree. However, this result is contrary to the findings of studies conducted in other countries [15] [16] which have indicated that individuals with lower educational attainment generally perceive higher stress. This may possibly be attributed to the long-standing, strong emphasis on educational attainment in Chinese society, which has led to the general view that individuals with higher educational levels should attain greater personal achievements and bear greater social responsibilities and expectations. However, it is not clear whether this unique sociocultural background has caused the aforementioned difference between Eastern and Western countries in the influence of educational level on perceived stress.Perceived stress was also found to be strongly related to the nature of work in the Chinese population. Participants who engaged in mental labor had higher perceived stress than did those who engaged in manual labor; in other words, they had a higher probability of a high perceived stress score (OR: 1.389, CI: 1.144-1.686). Such a result is not in complete agreement with the findings of previous studies. A survey by Lesage et al. 17 revealed that differences in perceived stress among administrative, technical, and blue-collar workers were statistically insignificant. However, the 501 participants of Lesage's study were selected from individuals who attended occupational health centers in northern France, whereas the participants of our study had a greater diversity of occupations, including teachers, doctors, taxi drivers and gardeners. The greater diversity of occupations included in our study provides a better reflection of the actual range of perceived stress across occupations, thereby helping the occupational factor to reach significance. Dėdelė et al. 18 performed a cross-sectional study on perceived stress among 571 full-time workers in Lithuania and found that blue-collar workers who spent relatively more time engaging in physical work had a higher risk of high perceived stress than white-collar workers, which appears to contradict our results. However, the ecology is more complex among individuals engaged in mental labor than among manual workers, which may have partially contributed to the difference in perceived stress we observed between the two occupational categories.The drinking habit of patients with CHD has also been identified as a potential factor associated with perceived stress. Our results indicated that participants with a habit of risky alcohol consumption had higher perceived stress (P = 0003). We also found that the probability that risky alcohol drinkers were assessed as having high stress was 1.492 times that of non-risky alcohol drinkers (CI: 1.146-1.944). These findings are consistent with those reported by Yoon et al. 19 , who showed that the proportion of individuals with adverse drinking habits was higher in the population with high perceived stress than in the population with low perceived stress. Although the study by Yoon et al. did not investigate possible causal relationships between high stress and at-risk drinking, there is no doubt that patients with a habit of risky alcohol consumption can have higher perceived stress. Therefore, for such individuals, emphasis should be placed on appropriate stress interventions in the formulation of rehabilitation programs.Interestingly, we also found that patients with CHD with children were nearly twice as likely to belong to the high stress group as those without children, which is consistent with the findings of Lesage et al. 17 Our results also showed that the perceived stress of patients with CHD was not correlated with age, sex or marital status. Previous studies have disagreed on these aspects. For instance, a study by Andreou et al. 20 indicated that younger individuals, women, and single or divorced individuals may have higher perceived stress. Cohen et al. 9 reported that perceived stress was higher in women, but unrelated to age; similar conclusions were reached in two other studies [21] [22] . However, Dėdelė et al. 18 asserted that older individuals had higher perceived stress. A study by Leung et al. 12 indicated higher levels of perceived stress in women, but a contrary result was reported by Ojard et al. 23 Although the measurement of the perceived stress of an individual is based on his/her subjective perceptions, it may also be affected by objective environmental stressors. Therefore, differences in the findings of the aforementioned studies may be 

LIMITATIONS

This study has several limitations. First, some degree of bias may have resulted from enrolment being limited to a single center. Further multicenter studies with a larger sample size are therefore warranted to validate the accuracy and clinical value of the present results. Second, although we were able to screen factors that were possibly related to perceived stress, we were unable to infer causal relationships given the cross-sectional nature of the study. To address this limitation, we plan to conduct further prospective cohort studies to further investigate the effects of the relevant factors on perceived stress in patients.

CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that patients with CHD have a generally high perceived stress. Individuals who engaged in mental labor, had a habit of risky alcohol consumption, and had a higher level of educational attainment had a higher probability of scoring high on perceived stress. These results can provide a scientific basis for further investigation of the relationship between stress management and prognosis in patients with CHD. We recommend the formulation of individualized stress management programs in cardiac rehabilitation to provide additional care to individuals with the aforementioned characteristics.

Each item is rated on a 5-point scale (0 = never, 1 = rarely, 2 = sometimes, 160 3 = fairly often, 4 = very often), with items 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 13 scored in the reverse 161 direction. Total scores range from 0 to 56 points, with higher scores indicating higher 162 psychological stress. 163 In addition to the CPSS, all the participates were asked to complete the Patient 164 Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scale and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) 165 scale to assess preexisting mental health comorbidities. The PHQ-9 is a self-rating scale 166 consisting of 9 items. A PHQ9 score greater than 5 indicates that the patient may be in 167 a mild or more depressive state. The GAD-7 is a 7-item self-rating scale indicating a 168 mild or more anxiety state when the score is greater than 5. 169 All the participants were asked to provide responses based on their own perceptions. concomitant diabetes mellitus (see Table 1 ). 195 The mean CPSS score of all the patients with CHD was 27.16 ± 6.35. Using the 196 median score of 27 as the cut-off point, the study participants were divided into a low-197 stress group (CPSS score ≤27) and a high-stress group (CPSS score >27). 198 Participants who had children, engaged in mental labor, or had a habit of risky 199 alcohol consumption had a higher probability of experiencing higher stress perception 200 levels. (see Table 2 ). Model 2 was adjusted by GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores, which has no major influence on 218 the conclusion (see Table 3 ).

The relationship between psychological stress and cardiovascular disease has perceived stress we observed between the two occupational categories. 270 The drinking habit of patients with CHD has also been identified as a potential 271 factor associated with perceived stress. Our results indicated that participants with a 272 habit of risky alcohol consumption had higher perceived stress (P = 0003). We also 273 found that the probability that risky alcohol drinkers were assessed as having high 274 perceived stress was 1.492 times that of non-risky alcohol drinkers (CI: 1.146-1.944). 275 These findings are consistent with those reported by Yoon et al. 36 Our results also showed that the perceived stress of patients with CHD was not 287 correlated with age, sex, or marital status.
