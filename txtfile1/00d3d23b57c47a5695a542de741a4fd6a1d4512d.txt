As of December 2021, over 281 million Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases

were reported worldwide and more than 8 billion vaccine doses administered to the population. 1 Although an increasing trend of vaccination is observed, with the recovery of economy and various international travel restrictions, a new challenge emerged and affect the daily lives of many who intend to travel abroad. In addition, due to lack of enough international cooperation and research transparency in investigating the mixture of vaccines from different countries, healthcare agencies in some parts of the world may require the travelers to obtain certain series of vaccines and testing upon entrance. 2, 6, 7 The controversy is that, however, some travelers are unable to comply with these requirements or acquire the listed vaccine series as they are denied access per home country policies.In conclusion, to accelerate the recovery of the economy and to restore international travel, researchers and international cooperations are urgently needed to investigate the mixture of different vaccines. It is also crucial for healthcare agencies and authorities to collaborate closely for mutual approval of COVID-19 vaccines manufactured in different countries.
