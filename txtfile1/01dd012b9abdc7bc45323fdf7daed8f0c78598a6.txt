[1] In this approach, endogenous biosynthetic pathways metabolically incorporate abioorthogonal functional group (e.g., azide,alkyne,alkene) into ab iological macromolecule.S ubsequent click reactions such as [2+ +3] alkyne-azide and [2+ +4] alkene-tetrazine cycloadditions can be used to visualize and/or capture the labeled biomolecules. [2, 3] Labeling is usually selective with respect to macromolecule type,b ut nonselective with respect to cell type.T his imposes severe limitations on the study of specific pathways in whole systems. [4] Advances in cell-type-selective labeling have recently been published, [5] but the detection of ap athogenic organism in human cells by using ab ioorthogonal chemical reporter has not so far been demonstrated. Based on the fundamental principles of medicinal chemistry, [6] we anticipated that pathogen-specific reporters could be developed from "clickable" biomolecular building blocks that are metabolized by pathogen-infected cells but rejected by healthy ones.T oe xplore this concept, we selected Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1) as am odel system.Recent studies have demonstrated that modified nucleosides containing at erminal alkyne can be metabolically incorporated into the genomes of adenovirus,h erpes virus, vaccinia virus,and papillomavirus. [7] After screening acollection of ethynyl nucleosides including 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU), [8] (2'S)-2-deoxy-2'-fluoro-5-ethynyluridine (Fara-EdU), [9] 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxycytidine (EdC), [10] and 7deaza-7-ethynyl-2'-deoxyadenosine (EdA), [11] we discovered that ethynyl-modified viral genomes could be produced without negatively impacting viral infectivity or egress. [7] All of these nucleosides,h owever,w ere also incorporated into cellular genomes. [8] [9] [10] [11] In samples in which the cells and viruses were simultaneously replicating,v iral DNAc ould not be detected over the large background of cellular DNA. [7] Herein, we report astrategy for pathogen-selective labeling that utilizes the relaxed fidelity of pathogen-encoded enzymes. [6] Then ew gemcitabine metabolite analogue 2'deoxy-2',2'-difluoro-5-ethynyluridine (dF-EdU) is selectively metabolized in HSV-1 infected cells owing to the expression of av iral thymidine kinase (TK). [12] Subsequent treatment with Cu I and an azide-conjugated fluorophore stains cells harboring an HSV-1 infection but not uninfected cells.I n addition to the large number of viruses that encode nucleoside kinases, [13a] this general approach should be applicable to viruses that encode error-prone polymerases (HIV,influenza virus,r hinovirus,p oliovirus,c oronavirus,e tc.), [13b,c] as well as parasitic mycoplasma that encode unique purine salvage enzymes. [13d] Thec hemotherapeutic drug gemcitabine (dFdC, 1)i s deaminated in vivo [14] to give 2'-deoxy-2',2'-difluorouridine (dFdU, 2;S cheme 1). Both dFdC and dFdU are phosphorylated and incorporated into nucleic acids by endogenous human enzymes. [15] dFdU is significantly less toxic than dFdC [16] and was therefore selected for further development as ametabolic label. dFdU derivatives containing substituents at the 5-position, such as 2'-deoxy-2',2'-difluoro-5-bromouridine (BrdFdU), are nontoxic to mammalian cell cultures but they inhibit herpes virus replication. [17] These results suggest the presence of BrdFdU-selective metabolism by one or more

Chemie virus-encoded enzymes,including herpes virus TK. We therefore selected the 5-position of dFdU as the attachment site for ab ioorthogonal functional group.W hile av ariety of bioorthogonal functional groups,i ncluding methylazide, [2g] vinyl, [3e] and ethynyl [8] [9] [10] groups can be utilized at this position, an ethynyl group was selected for its robust biocompatibility with DNAs ynthesis.A ccording to these design criteria, dF-EdU (3)was synthesized from gemcitabine over four steps with at otal yield of isolated product of 42 % (Scheme S1 in the Supporting Information).To evaluate the phosphorylation of dF-EdU in vitro, HSV-1 thymidine kinase (HSV1-TK) or human thymidine kinase 1( hTK) were incubated with dF-EdU in solutions containing ATP. Reversed-phase ion-pair chromatography was used to quantify the conversion of ATPinto ADP,aswell as the conversion of dF-EdU into dF-EdU-5'-monophosphate (dF-EdUMP). As apositive control, hTK was incubated with 2'-deoxythymidine (dT;F igure 1a). According to this assay, hTK was unable to catalyze the phosphorylation of dF-EdU ( Figure 1b) . In contrast, when HSV1-TK was used in place of hTK, ATPw as converted into ADP and dF-EdU was converted into dF-EdUMP (Figure 1c ,d and Figure S1 in the Supporting Information).To evaluate the structural basis of the TK selectivity of dF-EdU,acomparative crystallographic analysis was conducted. Crystals of HSV1-TK were soaked in solutions containing dF-EdU and the X-ray data solved at 2.1 r esolution by molecular replacement. Theo verall a/b architecture of the TK homodimer was similar to previous HSV1-TK structures. [18, 19] Thec ocrystal structure was refined to an R factor of 17.8 %a nd R free of 22.2 %( Table S1 in the Supporting Information) to provide the first reported structure of aT K bound to an ethnyl nucleoside.T he (F obs ÀF calc )e lectron density map contoured at 2.5 s was clearly interpretable,with dF-EdU in the active site,along with asulfate ion in the ATP binding pocket (Figure 2a) . The5-ethynyl group of dF-EdU is accommodated in ah ydrophobic pocket defined by the side chains of Tr p88, Ty r132, Ala 167, and Ala 168. Thes ugar moiety of dF-EdU adopts a2 ' -endo conformation, forming hydrogen bonds with Glu 83, Arg 163, and Glu 225 in an analogous fashion to that of dT itself ( Figure S2 ). [20] These observations are consistent with the ability of dF-EdU to be phosphorylated by HSV1-TK.To evaluate why dF-EdU is rejected by hTK, as uperimposition model of dF-EdU onto adTTP-hTK cocrystal was generated by using the "Superpose ligand" function in the molecular graphic program COOT (Figure 2b ). [21] According to this model, the terminal ethynyl carbon of dF-EdU is only 2.67 f rom the Cb of Thr163, ap osition known to mediate steric control over substrate specificity. [22] This potential steric clash is insufficient for the rejection of dF-EdU because 5ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) is phosphorylated by hTK ( Figure S3 ). Likewise,2 ' -deoxy-2',2'-difluorouridine (dFdU, Figure 1 ) is also as ubstrate for hTK. [15, 16] Thec ombined interplay of steric constraints from both the 5-ethnyl group and the 2'-fluorine atoms is therefore responsible for the inability of hTK to phosphorylate dF-EdU.C onsistent with this conclusion, the superimposition model places the (2'R) fluorine atom of dF-EdU 2.20-2.32 f rom Va l174/Ile 175, and its terminal ethynyl carbon atom 2.67 f rom Thr163 (Figure 2b) .Theability of dF-EdU to be phosphorylated by HSV1-TK and rejected by hTK suggested that dF-EdU might be selectively phosphorylated by HSV1-infected cells and incor- .

[22] . .Communications 7912 www.angewandte.org porated into DNA. To evaluate this possibility,V ero cells were infected by HSV-1 in the presence of 10 mm of dF-EdU for eight hours.Samples were then fixed and stained with an azide-conjugated fluorophore (green, Figure 3 ) and the DNA stain DAPI (blue,F igure 3). dF-EdU click labeling was apparent in infected ( Figure 3a )b ut not in uninfected (Figure 3b )c ells.d F-EdU staining of HSV-1 viral replication compartments was apparent in the DAPI-excluded areas of the nuclei (circle in Figure 3a ,a nd Figure 3c ). These morphologically distinct regions were confirmed as HSV-1 replication compartments by immunostaining of ICP8 as an HSVspecific marker. [7] Cellular nucleic acids were also stained in some cells (rectangle in Figure 3a ,a nd Figure 3d ), thus suggesting that both viral and cellular polymerases were capable of utilizing dF-EdU triphosphate as as ubstrate.To evaluate wheher viral TK expression is required for the incorporation of dF-EdU into cellular and viral nucleic acids, HeLa cells were transduced with alentiviral vector encoding HSV1-TK and green fluorescent protein (GFP), and selected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to generate the cell line HeLa-HSVtk(+ +). These cells were subjected to as econd round of transduction and more stringent FACS selection to generate the cell line HeLa-HSVtk(+ ++ +). Cell cultures were then treated with dF-EdU,f ixed, stained, and characterized by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry (Figure 4 ). Wild-type HeLa cells exhibited little or no fluorescent staining of dF-EdU when dF-EdU was applied at 1-100 mm (Figure 4a ). In contrast, HeLa-HSVtk(+ +)a nd HeLa-HSVtk(+ ++ +)c ells exhibited strong labeling by 0.1-1.0 mm of dF-EdU.T he intensity of dF-EdU staining was approximately 10-fold higher in HeLa-HSVtk(+ ++ +)cells than HeLa-HSVtk(+ +)c ells (Figure 4b,c) . DNAw as the primary target of dF-EdU incorporation, as revealed by the selective staining of metaphase chromosomes ( Figure S4 ). dF-EdU was essentially nontoxic to all three cell lines tested ( Figure S5 ), thus indicating ah igh degree of compatibility with DNA synthesis. [12] Taken together,t hese results demonstrate that the metabolic incorporation of dF-EdU into the DNAo f HSV-1-infected cells (Figure 3 ) is dependent upon HSV1-TK expression (Figure 4) .Thet endencyo fp athogen-encoded enzymes to exhibit relaxed substrate specificity has been widely exploited in medicinal chemistry [6] but it has not previously been utilized for the pathogen-dependent incorporation of bioorthogonal functional groups into mammalian cells.Herein, we report the [25] were included ( Figure S6 ). Negative controls did not receive any nucleoside analogue but were otherwise treated identically.Scale bars:50mm.Chemie clickable nontoxic nucleoside analogue dF-EdU,w hich is selectively metabolized by virus-infected cells as ar esult of their expression of al ow-fidelity thymidine kinase.A s ar eporter molecule,d F-EdU is compatible with chain elongation following its incorporation into DNA, thus allowing highly sensitive and selective click staining of infected cells.This same type of approach should also be applicable to pathogens that encode unique polynucleotide polymerases and/or nucleoside salvage enzymes. [13] Nucleoside derivatives containing bioorthogonal functional groups will therefore enable aw ide variety of diagnostic and therapeutic applications, [23] including cell-fate control and suicide-gene therapies.
