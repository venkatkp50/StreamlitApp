ORF1ab Protein Sequence comparison of NCoV and MERS CoV

The above is the Proteomic sequence of ORF1AB of NCoV where, Yellow residues-Corona Rpol N domain Green residues-Viral Helicase Yellow + cyan + Green residues-Region sharing identity to the MERS CoV Proteome (Fig. 3.2) . (Fig. 3.3 ).

Fig. 3.4 Comparison of the M Protein with MERS CoV proteome using BLAST

Inference: The above result shows that the query M protein shares 45.05% identity to MERS CoV M protein. This can impart some minor variation in the Membrane protein structure between the two pathogens ( Fig. 3.4) .

Fig. 3.5 Comparison of the E Protein with MERS CoV proteome using BLAST

Inference: From the above BLAST result it can be inferred that the E protein shares a considerable similarity with the E protein of MERS CoV with query coverage of 94% and identity being 40% (Fig. 3.5 ). Inference: The above result shows that MERS CoV Nucleocapsid shares 50.26% identity to the N protein query with coverage of 88% (Fig. 3.6 ).

Conclusion

From the above comparative analysis between the structural proteins and ORF1ab (being the longest protein in the virus) of NCoV and MERS Corona Virus, it can be concluded that both the organisms share a considerable similarity though not very high. However the ORF1ab is the longest protein in the Query proteome and is found to share a great similarity to that of MERS Corona Virus. Thus the study can be focused on the annotation of ORF1ab protein and targeting it for the Drug Docking studies. Further chapters of the book focus on the complete structural and functional characterization of the ORF1ab polyprotein of Novel Corona virus 2019.
