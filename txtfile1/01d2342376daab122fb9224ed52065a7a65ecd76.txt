Three dose-level cohorts (750, 1500, and 3000 mg) were included to evaluate each 120 mAb and were initiated in a dose-escalation design. In each cohort, participants were 121 randomized at a 3:1 ratio to receive either the single mAb (n=3 or 6) or placebo (n=1 122 or 2). mAbs or placebo was dispensed into normal saline and was administered via The sample size of each study was consistent with a phase 1 first-in-human study. The 154 safety analysis included all participants who were randomized and received any dose 155 of the study drug. Categorical and continuous data were summarized descriptively. 156 Participants were analyzed according to the study drug they received. Participants summary statistics are reported to 3 significant digits except for Tmax (reported in 163 median values), which is reported to 1 decimal place.
