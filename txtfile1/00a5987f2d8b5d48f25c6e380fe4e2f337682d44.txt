To assess whether major medical journal editorial desk rejection (without peer review) of two 30 focal clinical research manuscripts is related to author gender, or women's physiology topics.

31

Given evidence for bias related to women in science and medicine, and editorial board attitudes, 32 our hypothesis was that submissions by women authors, on women's reproductive, non-disease 33 topics received differential editorial assessment. despite being more likely to include the ideal, now recommended sex/gender analysis (19) .

In summary, authorship of publications allows women to share and promote their research.

Most importantly, high impact journal publication determines newsworthiness and without this,

Using the journal-specific rejection dates of these two articles in Supplemental Tables 1 and 2,   168 we reviewed the next two issues to investigate the gender of first and senior (final) authors, the 169 range of original research topics, and the funding of each. We further examined the gender of 170 the editor writing the rejecting letter.

The process of selecting clinical research articles from the two published issues following focal 209 manuscript rejection is shown in Figure 1 . The ten issues from five major general medical 210 journals produced 74 original research articles for review.

The literature suggests that women also could achieve more publication success by including 321 positive words such as "novel", "unique", and "promising" in their manuscripts; although even 322 when using these words, women authors still had less high-impact publication success than 323 men first / last authors. (24) Also, although an increase of positive word choice to describe the 324 focal papers may have made it more likely to achieve peer-review, that would have been 325 unlikely to change: 1) the biases on author-gender and women-health focussed topics, and/or 2) 326 the prevalence of editorial bias/censorship.

Although it might be considered a limitation that the senior author of this paper is also the senior 307 author on one and the first author on the other of the rejected focal papers, we believe it 308 increases transparency. In addition, hers is a hard-to-avoid bias since she designed this 309 analysis and engaged the librarian and editor as co-authors. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 There is increasing evidence that diversity improves both productivity and impactful 432 research. (51) For these reasons we suggest that each general medical journal editorial board hire 433 a "sex / gender champion" editor with sensitivity to bias issues who is integrated into the 434 journal's leadership structure and reviews all scientific articles for relevance to women's health.

Each manuscript is thoroughly evaluated by the JAMA editorial staff, who assess the manuscript's quality and its priority for publication. Those manuscripts judged unlikely to succeed through stringent external review or whose subject matter does not meet our current editorial priorities are rejected at that point.About half of the approximately 6600 manuscripts submitted to us annually are rejected after such inhouse review; less than 9% of manuscripts are eventually accepted for publication in JAMA. Based on our evaluation, I regret to inform you that we will not pursue the manuscript you have submitted for publication, and we will not be referring it to JAMA Internal Medicine. Table 3 shows that the cohort analyzed is not representative of women of reproductive age, with very few women included who were aged 30 years or younger and a median age of 41.6 years. This is likely due to the large number of younger women using oral contraception. This changes the conclusions that can be made about the broader group of women of reproductive age. While we realize that you may be disappointed with our decision, we hope that providing you with this information promptly will allow you to submit your manuscript to another journal without the delay entailed by the external review process. Many thanks for submitting your manuscript to The Lancet. We have considered your manuscript, but our decision is that it would be better placed elsewhere.Unfortunately, we can accept only a very small proportion of the many papers we receive each week. We are sorry to be unhelpful on this occasion, though we would like you to think of us again in the future. Thank you for sending us your paper. We read it with interest but I regret to say that we have decided not to publish it in the BMJ as we felt it lacks direct relevance to patient care or practice.We receive over 8000 submissions a year and accept less than 10%. We do therefore have to make hard decisions on just how interesting an article will be to our general clinical readers, how much it adds, and how much practical value it will be.We decided your paper was probably better placed in a more specialist journal. We are sorry to disappoint you and I hope it will not deter you from submitting articles to us in future.

The journal(s) (if any) you have selected at submission are: Your manuscript outlines the prevalence of anovulation in a cohort of women in Norway. Knowing the prevalence of anovulation among women of reproductive age could have important consequences for family planning and could help guide clinical practice. Unfortunately, though your finding that over a third of the women in your study were anovulatory at a given point is interesting, the CMAJ editors who carefully read your manuscript felt that your study did not add enough to what is already known to be given priority for publication in the CMAJ at this time.Each year we receive over a thousand research manuscripts and we have room to publish only about 8% of those submitted. This means we have to reject some good quality manuscripts that are not as suitable for the CMAJ as others that we accept. When deciding upon the acceptability of a manuscript for publication in the CMAJ, the editors consider factors such as its application to medical practice and other manuscripts recently published.If you think that we have made a mistake in rejecting your manuscript, we are prepared to reconsider the decision through our Appeal process. You can access this process by following the link in the Author Centre in ScholarOne.Thank you again for giving CMAJ the opportunity to consider your manuscript.

Based on our editorial evaluation, I regret to inform you that we will not accept your manuscript for publication. However, as you are aware, the JAMA Network allows submitted manuscripts to have more than one opportunity for evaluation for publication. This network includes JAMA Pediatrics, for which you previously gave us permission to forward your manuscript, and we have transferred your manuscript as requested.Further evaluation of your paper will be expedited by the editor of JAMA Pediatrics. Your manuscript is now under the consideration of JAMA Pediatrics, Thank you for sending us your paper. We read it with some interest, but I am sorry to say that we are simply not the target journal for your paper. We do not prioritize studies on surrogate outcomes and receive many large studies on clinical outcomes that change practice. In comparison with these and many other papers we have to consider, this one is clearly a lower priority for us.We receive over 3600 research papers each year and accept less than 5%. We do not send out for external peer review manuscripts whose subject matter, design or topic do not meet our current priorities and are unlikely to make it through our process. We have to make hard decisions on just how interesting an article will be to our general clinical readers and how much it adds to what is already known. We hope that this will allow you to promptly submit this manuscript elsewhere.You may want to consider sending this paper to BMJ Open.

Editors from both The Lancet and The Lancet specialty journals, have read it, but their decision was that it would be better placed elsewhere.Unfortunately, The Lancet can accept only a very small proportion of the many papers we receive each week; the total papers received per week is now about 180. We are sorry to be unhelpful on this occasion, though we would like you to think of us again in the future.Yours sincerely, Your manuscript, "Adolescent Combined Hormonal Contraceptive Use and Lower Peak Bone Mass," was evaluated by external reviewers and was discussed among the editors. Although it is interesting, I am sorry to say it was not accepted for publication. This was an editorial decision and reflects an assessment of the merits of your manuscript as compared with the many others we receive. Unfortunately, many manuscripts must be declined for lack of space.

Sabine Kleinert Executive Editor

Thank you very much for the opportunity to review this manuscript. year old women using hormonal contraception (E-CHC) vs. non-users (N-CHC), and report lower bone accrual rates at the femoral neck in the E-CHC group over a 2-year period. The paper is well written and the data are overall very important. My comments are described below. <b>Comments for the Author</b> In this study, the authors propose to conduct a population-level evaluation of changes in BMD over time in adolescents and young adult users and non-users of hormonal contraceptives. While this topic is very important, the study has many methodological limitations that detract from its findings.Abstract: Methods: The authors should note the low participation rate and follow-up rate for study participants. Results: The authors should clearly state their null results for the young adult participants in the study. Conclusion: The conclusion is vastly overstated. These study participants were not followed until an age at which they would have been expected to achieve peak BMD. As such, the authors cannot state that CHC use "is associated with interference in achievement of peak BMD". The manuscript style is lacking the appropriate grammar, sentence structure, and polish of typical NEJM studies. Study objectives are clearly stated, but the Results section does not mirror the authors' objective statements.

Methods:

The participant response rate, and the longitudinal follow-up rate, were both quite low. These facts should be cited as a limitation. No exclusion criteria were listed. Were participants enrolled if they had other diseases that could influence bone health (such as diabetes, IBD, celiac disease) or if they were taking other medications known to impact bone health (such as anticonvulsants)? Were non-CHC users normally menstruating? Were participants excluded if they were significantly underweight? No mention of these important other factors is made.One of the most significant limitations of this study is the classification of CHC exposure. Given the significant differences in systemic exposure to estrogens between oral contraceptives, the vaginal ring, and the transdermal patch, it is inappropriate to lump users of these contraceptives together based upon estradiol content of the medication itself. It is well known, for example, that systemic estradiol exposure from the ring is far less than that of a typical 30 mcg EE pill. This misclassification needs to be remedied before the study results can be believed. Thank you for giving the CMAJ editors an opportunity to review your manuscript, "Combined Hormonal Contraceptives Use and Bone Mineral Density Changes in Adolescent and Young Women in a Prospective Population-Based Canada-wide Observational Study" (our reference CMAJ-17-0463).Although your topic is an interesting one, I am sorry to tell you that we have decided to decline your manuscript for publication in CMAJ. The editors who carefully read your paper concluded that because of the small sample size and low response rate, particularly in the youth category, the findings are likely not generalizable. Given the number of studies published in the area the findings are likely not novel enough for publication in CMAJ at this time.Each year we receive over a thousand research manuscripts, and we have room to publish only about 8% of them. This means we have to reject some good quality manuscripts that are not as suitable for CMAJ as those we accept. When deciding on acceptability of a manuscript for publication in CMAJ, we consider factors such as its application to medical practice and other manuscripts recently published.Thank you again for giving us a chance to consider your manuscript for CMAJ. I hope that we will be able to give you a more favourable response on a future submission.Sincerely, CMAJ -medical knowledge that matters CMAJ showcases innovative research and ideas aimed at improving health for people in Canada and globally.
