The current vaccines that were developed by targeting the prototype SARS-CoV-2 Figure 3F) . Importantly, at that point, the RBD trimer group attained a much higher 216 level of RBD-specific plasma cells in the bone marrow. Although the precise origin of 217 this superiority of the RBD trimer mRNA vaccine is currently unknown, the fact that 218 the difference appeared after the boost suggests memory B cells induced by the RBD 219 trimer mRNA vaccine immunization may be functionally superior.

J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Next, we found that all three vaccines were able to induce strong S protein-specific 221 T cell responses on day 35 after the initial immunization. Interestingly, the RBD trimer 222 vaccine tended to elicit more antigen-specific polyfunctional CD4 T cells than CD8 T 223 cells expressing type 1 (Th1) immune response cytokines such as interferon gamma 224 (IFNγ), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and interleukin (IL)-2 ( Figure 3G and 3H). This 225 biased CD4 helper response may help to explain the broad and potent neutralizing 226 antibody response observed in animals that were immunized with the RBD trimer 227 mRNA vaccine (see above). In contrast, the native spike vaccine tended to trigger a 228 higher CD8 T cell response than the RBD trimer mRNA vaccine, as determined by to WT D614G, these mAbs showed either comparable activity or enhanced activity 304 against the major variants. In particular, like that observed for immune serum, many 305 mAbs demonstrated improved neutralizing activity largely due to 242-244del mutation 306 in the NTD (Fig. 5B) . Furthermore, mAb T6 was able to exert at least a 3-fold increase 307 in neutralization to 3 of the 4 variants of concern, thus suggesting that its epitope might 308 have become more exposed in some of these variants. Examination of the enhancement 309 patterns across the single and triple mutant pseudoviruses further showed that the 242- Table S1 ). In both models, the CL and CH1 of the T6 Fab were not built due to weak 343 densities. As the T6 Fab is only bound to the "up" RBD, it follows that the T6 epitope 344 must be buried when RBD is in the "down" conformation in the spike trimer. 345 We further determined the crystal structure of the T6 Fab bound to the RBD of Figure 6C and Table S2 ). The T6 Fab buries a surface area of 661.4 348 Å 2 on the RBD. Of this, 358.8 Å 2 was composed of the heavy chain and 302.6 Å 2 by 349 the light chain ( Figure 6D ). A total of 16 residues from the T6 Fab, and 11 residues from Figure 6F ). The mutated residues N417, K484, and Y501, 353 shared among several SARS-CoV-2 variants were not located within the epitope of the 354 T6 Fab, although N417 and K484 were both located in a proximate position; Y501 has 355 located some distance away ( Figure 6D ). The L452R mutation, found in several SARS- that the mechanism underlying its neutralization ability was to compete with ACE2 to 365 bind to the RBD, thereby disrupting the very first step of viral entry ( Figure 6H ). Finally, 366 analysis of T6 epitope residues in the GISAID database revealed a high degree of 367 conservation, thus providing a sequence and structural basis for its broad and potent 368 neutralizing activity against a wide range of SARS-CoV-2 variants ( Figure 6D ).

The RBD trimer mRNA vaccine protects K18-hACE2 mice from death after CoV-2 infection. In terms of viral load in lungs, WT D614 infected control animals had 396 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 9.6×10 6 copies/mg for sgRNA and 8.0×10 7 copies/mg for gRNA, which were about 397 two-logs higher than that in the vaccinated animals (9.6×10 4 copies/mg for sgRNA and Students' t-test (two-tailed) (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ****P < 0.0001).

Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 variants by each antibody, related to Figure 5B . Pseudoviruses bearing the indicated mutations were tested against serial dilutions of each mAb. Neutralizing activity was defined as the percent reduction in luciferase activities compared to no antibody controls. Levels of resistance were calculated as the fold change in IC50 between each mutant and WT D614G, as presented in Figure 5B .
