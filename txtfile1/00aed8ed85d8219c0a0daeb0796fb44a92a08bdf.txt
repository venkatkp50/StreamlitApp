Introduction

Seasonal influenza is a significant respiratory viral infection caused by influenza A or B virus, manifested as acute upper respiratory tract infection, primary viral pneumonia, secondary bacterial pneumonia, or respiratory failure. During winter, it spreads globally in the northern and southern hemispheres, causing 3-5 million severe cases and 290000-650000 deaths yearly [1] . Influenza viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae; their genome consists of negative-sense, single-stranded, segmented RNAs [2] . Influenza virus A is the leading cause of seasonal epidemics in humans. This virus is classified based on the similarity of the hemagglutinin (18 subtypes divided into two groups) and neuraminidase sequences (11 subtypes divided into three groups) [3] . To ensure the efficacy of SIV, the vaccine seed viruses are selected periodically by WHO according to the available genetic, antigenic, and epidemiologic information related to current circulating influenza viruses.In contrast to widely used SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA vaccines (mRNA vaccines), the licensed influenza vaccines are inactivated vaccines, live attenuated vaccines, or recombinant hemagglutinin vaccines. Inactivated SIV had three types (whole-virion vaccine, split-virion vaccine, and subunit vaccine) and was produced by growing the vaccine seed virus in chicken embryonated eggs [2] . Live attenuated SIV is administered intranasally and mimics J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f a natural infection which elicits a broad immune response and produces IgA and IgG antibodies [4, 5] . The recombinant hemagglutinin SIV is produced by a recombinant-protein-expressing system using insect cells and baculovirus [6] .Moreover, Influenza viruses are in continuous genomic changes that result annually in small antigenic changes "antigenic drift", which necessitate a frequent yearly update of seasonal influenza vaccine (SIV). In contrast, significant genomic changes "antigenic shift" occurs less frequently but usually lead to outbreaks or even pandemics caused by a newly emerging strain [7] . The SIV is essential to prevent influenza transmission, reduce health complications from influenza, especially in high-risk patients, and alleviate the resulting economic impact [8] . Saudi MOH has made tremendous efforts before COVID-19 pandemic to increase SIV coverage among patients at risk, pilgrims, and the general population.As COVID-19 pandemic waves are still on-going and the death toll among infected people is rising worldwide, there is an increasing concern about possible complications in the COVID-19 pandemic course introduced by seasonal influenza outbreaks. The available information regarding the possible impact of influenza coinfection during influenza seasons is limited. The reported coincidence cases raised a concern about the problematic pandemic course [9] [10] [11] . On the other hand, some reports are starting to emerge discussing the impact of seasonal influenza vaccination on COVID-19 infection. Two previous studies showed that the SIV lowers the COVID-19 severity, intensive care requirement, ventilator support, and mortality [12, 13] . Furthermore, Grossberg et al. [14] showed that the influenza vaccine does not protect against COVID-19; however, it may attenuate the severity of symptoms. In contrast, some reported data suggested that the influenza vaccine is a relevant risk factor for COVID-19 [15, 16] . However, no studies have been conducted to determine the SIV coverage during the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia and its association with the COVID 19 range. Hence, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f this study aimed to investigate the SIV coverage among Saudi patients during the COVID-19 pandemic and its association with COVID-19 spread and severity.

Study Design

A cross-sectional study design was adopted in this study. Those confirmed COVID-19 infection patients (N=1734) from the selected governmental hospitals (N=03) of Saudi Arabia were recruited for this study. This study was conducted between May 1, 2020, and August 31, 2020.

Samples

Efforts have been taken to select three governmental hospitals from different Saudi Arabia regions to reach the generalizability of the findings. Those hospitals were King Fahd Hospital of the University (Khobar), Qatif central hospital, and Uhud Hospital (Madinah). The COVID-19 infection was confirmed using the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus-2Real-Time reverse transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR). The authors have adopted a criterion-based sampling approach for including the patients in this study. This study included only those patients administered with the inactive influenza vaccine by Saudi MOH, those with ≥ 18 years of age, and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 by SARS-On the other hand, the critically ill patients who could not fill the survey and those with mental or linguistic barriers were excluded. All COVID-19 patients who met the inclusion criteria were invited to participate in this study. The ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University (IRB-2020-181), Dammam, Saudi Arabia.

J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f

All participants were administered an online self-administered Arabic version of the questionnaire to collect the demographic and clinical data. In addition, all patients have received phone calls preceding the survey distribution. Furthermore, ethical concerns were followed, and privacy and anonymity were assured. Informed consent was also obtained prior to gathering the data from the participants. All participants were provided with a stipulated duration and frequently reminded to respond to the survey. The demographic data deals with the patient's age, gender, nationality, educational level, and occupation in the questionnaire.The clinical data collected includes the information about receipt of SIV during past influenza season, time of laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19, time of symptom appearance (onset of COVID-19), comorbidities (i.e., chronic lung disease, ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, asthma, chronic liver disease, malignancy, or blood disorders [sickle cell disease, thalassemia]), and disease severity level (i.e., mild, moderate, or severe) of COVID-19. A translated English version of this questionnaire is provided in Appendix 1.

Data Analysis

Descriptive statistics in a simple percentage technique were adopted to describe the patients' demographic characteristics. In addition, a chi-square test was applied to reveal the potential association between the SIV coverage with the spread of COVID-19. Further, the student's t-test was used to determine the difference in the incidence and severity of COVID-19 among vaccinated patients compared with non-vaccinated. All statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS 22.0 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.) with a significance level of 0.05.

Results

A total of 1734 COVID-19 patients were included, of which 926 (53.4%) were males, the majority of them (N=1585; 91.4%) were between 21 and 60 years of age, the average age was 37.7±11.6 (Mean±SD). Most of them were Saudis (N=1564; 90.1%). One thousand thirty-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f one (59.4%) were carrying university degrees, and 282 (16.3%) were health-care workers (HCWs) ( Table 1 ).In terms of influenza vaccination, 335 participants have received SIV before or during past influenza season. Vaccine uptake was significantly higher among females 189 (23.4%) compared with 146 (15.8%) (P <0.0001). Influenza vaccine coverage among Saudis (20.1%) was significantly higher than non-Saudis (11.8%) (P = 0.009). Influenza vaccine coverage of patients who had university-level education was significantly higher (20.6%) compared with patients with lower educational levels (illiterates 11.6% and below high school 14%) (P <0.001). Although the study participants included 282 health workers, only 121 (42.9%) received influenza vaccines during the past year (Table 1) . Table 1 Demographic characteristics of the patients in relation with influenza vaccine. (Table 3) . Even though a decrease of COVID-19 severity is found in the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f vaccinated group; however, it was not statistically significant (P=0.345). In terms of SIV impact on SARS-COV-2 spread, our statistical data analysis showed a significant decrease in the probability of getting infected by SARS-COV-2 (P=0.022) after receiving SIV (Table 4) . 

Discussion

Influenza vaccination is the backbone for alleviating influenza outbreaks and disease These findings reflect the effect of education on health-seeking behaviours. Thus, getting vaccinated is significantly correlated with a higher knowledge score on the vaccine, participation in educational campaigns, improved access to vaccination, and obligatory immunization policies [24] .From 2006, published studies from Saudi Arabia tried to calculate the SIV coverage rates among some risk groups but not among the general population (Appendix 2). Among those studies, most of them reported that the targeted risk group was HCWs with variable coverage percentages from 5.9% up to 54.5% [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . In this study, the SIV coverage rate of HCWs was 42.9%, which seems higher than the median yearly HCW coverage rate (33.3%) [38] . Further, the SIV coverage rate can be higher among HCWs if a mandatory vaccination policy is applied. Mandatory SIV vaccination of HCWs has been adopted in several countries to prevent influenza transmission in healthcare settings [41] . The clinical presentations of influenza and COVID-19 can be similar [42] . Also, lymphopenia has been observed in patients with severe influenza. 35 Coinfections with a severe course or a fatal outcome have been reported [43] [44] [45] [46] . The risk for in-hospital death in patients with COVID-19 is five times higher than that of influenza hospitalized patients [47] ; however, the outcome of Influenza-COVID-19 coinfections seems to be comparable with the outcome of COVID-19 alone [41] .A vaccine-induced change in innate immunity could explain the mechanisms behind the protective effect of SIV. Immunological memory cells are found in the innate immune compartment and tissue-resident stem cells and can be triggered by infections and vaccines [48] [49] [50] . As a result, these cells will defend the body against multiple pathogens, including those not targeted by the vaccine itself. This explanation is supported by the evidence that frequent childhood vaccinations and repeated pathogen infections might be resulting in trained immunity of innate immune cells, immune fitness of adaptive immune cells, or cross-protection of antibodies [51] . Furthermore, activation of innate immunity is also supported by the fact that innate immune system adaptations after SIV may be compromised by the aging process, which correlates with the observed lower protection rate of SIV vaccine in elderly patients [52, 53] .The available data regarding the correlation between SIV and COVID-19 are limited; recently published studies showed increased influenza vaccine uptake during the COVID-19 pandemic correlates with reduced SARS-CoV-2 spread and decreased COVID-19 morbidity and mortality [54] [55] [56] . Furthermore, a study by Fink et al. [13] found that more than 53,000 patients
