Introduction.

The Covid-19 pandemic (caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus) has spread throughout the world, often in multiple waves in individual countries. The timing of these waves of infection has been difficult for public health authorities to predict.The association of outdoor environmental variables, such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed, with the spread of Covid-19 has been studied. One primary finding is that colder temperatures are associated with a higher incidence of Covid-19 infection and mortality (Wu 2020) .However, there are both empirical and logical reasons to question the degree to which these outdoor environmental variables might directly cause the spread of Covid-19. First, the empirical findings. Some investigators have found that Covid-19 is positively (rather than negatively) associated with temperature below 3 C (37.4째 F) (Xie 2020) . Others have found that Covid-19 incidence peaks between 5 C and 15 C (rather than continuing to rise at the coldest temperatures) (Huang 2020 ). In addition, a peak in Covid-19 incidence was observed in the sunbelt of the United States in the summer of 2020, and in the warmer months of April and May of 2021 in India (Leffler 2021) .On logical grounds, it has been unclear why outdoor environmental variables might be causatively linked with Covid-19 in a direct fashion, given that Covid-19 is believed to primarily spread indoors.However, we noted that there is a large body of literature demonstrating that the major predictor of indoor ventilation is in fact outdoor temperature, with wind speed generally playing a lesser role. The reason is that temperature influences both occupant window-opening behavior and stack ventilation resulting from indoor-outdoor temperature differences.We therefore sought to analyze the association of mortality from Covid-19 with environmental variables, from the perspective of their potential impact on indoor ventilation.

Methods.

We selected countries for analysis if the ratio of excess mortality during the pandemic to Covid-19 mortality from the World Mortality Dataset did not exceed 1.8 (Karlinsky 2021 , Kobak 2021 . Our reasoning was that if the Covid-19 mortality was well below the excess mortality, the country was probably under-reporting Covid-19 mortality, either due to poor testing levels or suppression of information. This threshold was admittedly arbitrary, but it did serve to objectively include countries reputed to have developed and open health systems (such as Finland, with a ratio of 1.7), while excluding countries believed to have suppressed information about the pandemic, such as Iran (ratio 2.0) and Russia (ratio 3.6). This method also excluded countries with more closed health systems, such as China, for which no excess mortality data were available in the World Mortality Dataset.Covid-19 mortality data for each week of the pandemic were downloaded from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering on October 3, 2021 (Hopkins 2021). For some countries, particularly smaller countries, this dataset merely lists Covid-19 mortality for the entire country. For other countries, such as the United States, Canada, Brazil, and Chile, the dataset lists mortality for states or provinces separately. Among the countries analyzed, we selected states (or provinces) for analysis by listing the most populous city in each of the country's states, and starting with the most populous such city, accepting the city and state for analysis if the state had at least 5 reported Covid-19 deaths, and if the city was at least 500 km from another of the country's cities accepted for analysis. Thus, for states close to each other, such as New York and New Jersey, only the former was accepted into the analysis. The reason to exclude cities within 500 km of each other is that cities close to each other could be subject to essentially the same weather system.For some countries, the Hopkins dataset contains a week with small decreases in cumulative mortality for the week, which would appear to represent negative deaths for the week. These anomalies were handled by eliminating the week with apparent negative deaths. In the case of Belgium, the worldometer data were used, because the data appeared similar, but did not have this anomaly.For each accepted city, the daily temperature, dew point, and wind speed during the pandemic were downloaded from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA 2021). The median weekly temperature (median of all daily maxima and minima) was calculated.It is on average 23 days from exposure to Sars-CoV-2 and death (Leffler 2020) . Therefore, we analyzed the association of median weekly temperature with the weekly mortality 3 weeks later. In essence, the time between each exposure day and each outcome day was between 14 and 28 days, which straddled the 23 day average lag between exposure and death. For each exposure week, the relative risk of Covid-19 mortality was determined. The relative risk was calculated as observed Covid-19 deaths for the week divided by expected Covid-19 deaths. The expected deaths were defined as the total number of the region's Covid-19 deaths in the dataset divided by the number of weeks of the pandemic with data for that region. The pandemic start for a region was defined as the first week in the dataset with a Covid-19 death, or the fourth week in the dataset after Covid-19 cases were recorded in the region in the dataset (whichever came first).The relative risk of Covid-19 at each temperature was depicted graphically. For each temperature within one country's data, the average relative risk for that country at that temperature was obtained. Then, the relative risks for all countries at that temperature were averaged. Thus, each country contributed to the analysis at each temperature just one time, at most. For temperatures of -8 C (-17.6째 F) or below, or 33 C (91.4째 F) or above, there were fewer than 10 observations. Therefore, in order to obtain reliable estimates at these extreme temperatures, data from neighboring temperatures were included until at least 10 observations were available, and the mean relative risk was plotted against the median temperature in the observation set.The household prevalence of air-conditioning in each country was obtained from reports of the International Energy Agency (IEA 2018 (IEA , 2019 , which published either the actual prevalence, or the number of air-conditioning units per household. A report on sales volume was used to calculate the number of air-conditioning units sold annually per capita in multiple countries (Japan 2019).

Once this relationship was determined, then sales volume in other countries could be used to determine household prevalence. Finally, the dependence of air-conditioning prevalence on gross domestic productivity per capita and mean annual temperature was used to estimate the prevalence in countries not covered by the previous reports. The estimation of regional household air-conditioning prevalence will be covered in detail in an appendix.

Statistical analysis.

Pairs of temperature ranges were compared by identifying regions which had at least one death within each of the two ranges. The risk ratio for each country was calculated as the ratio of weekly mortality in the two temperature ranges. The logarithm of the risk ratio was compared with zero by a one-sample t-test. The regional mortality data studied contained no individually identifiable information. The study was approved by the Office of Research Subjects Protection at Virginia Commonwealth University.

Temperature.

We identified 142 regions in 68 countries for analysis ( Table 1 ). The graph of Covid-19 mortality as a function of outdoor temperature had two distinct peaks, separated by a local minimum at room temperature (20 C, 68째 F) ( Figure 1 , Tables 2 to 4).

Air-Conditioning.

To determine if air-conditioning might influence the dependence of Covid-19 mortality on temperature, we analyzed separately regions estimated to have a low household prevalence of air-conditioning (<25%) compared with those with a higher prevalence (>50%, Figure 2 , Table 5 ). The graphical profiles do not look very different between the two groups, though the data are noisy (Figure 2) . Interestingly, the elevation in relative risk with cooling to 14 C (57.2째 F) is more abrupt in the regions with more air-conditioning. All rights reserved.

The relative risk of Covid-19 appears to be elevated with the lowest wind speeds (below 3 m/s). At or above 3 m/s, the relative risk is somewhat lower, though above 11 m/s, the data are noisy because of fewer available observations.

Windows are more likely to be closed when it is cold outside, especially below 15 C (59째 F). Therefore, if one assumes the impact of the wind on indoor ventilation is zero with a temperature of 15 C (59째 F) or below, then wind speed can be replaced with a value of zero with these cold temperatures. The resulting association does point to lower Covid-19 mortality with higher wind speeds, but again with some variation in the data (Figure 4) .

Figure 4. Weekly Covid-19 mortality as a function of median weekly wind speed 3 weeks previously, assuming that due to window closure, effective wind speed able to be transmitted indoors is zero when outdoor temperature is at or below 15 C (59째 F).

We also plotted the relationship of Covid-19 mortality as a function of wind speed, in which the effective wind speed transmitted indoors was also estimated to be zero due to window closure in predominantly air-conditioned regions when the outdoor temperature was over 30 C (86째 F). The plot was essentially unchanged, and is therefore not included.All rights reserved.

The two-peaked curve is similar to the relationship of mortality with outdoor temperature, but the peaks and valleys are flatter. Whether humidity provides information on mortality independent of temperature must await multivariable analysis.

Window-opening and outdoor temperature.

A literature review demonstrated that outdoor temperature was a major determinant of occupant window-opening behavior in both homes and workplaces (Table 6, Figure 6 ). (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted December 7, 2021. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.05.21267334 doi: medRxiv preprint Table 3 .Traditionally, people close windows when it is very cold outside to keep the building from getting too cold. Between freezing and room temperature, the number of windows (Dick 1951 , Brundrett 1977 , Brundrett 1978 , area of window opening (Baird 1969) , and the probability of window-opening (Pallot 1962; Dubrul 1988; Erhorn 1988) are roughly linear. The probability of window-opening progressively increases, reaching a maximum close to or just above room temperature in some studies (Rijal 2008; Rijal 2013; Herkel 2008) . Window-opening increases progressively with momentary (Pallot 1962) , mean monthly (Pallot 1962; , and seasonal (Weihl 1990) temperature.Windows in German homes were typically open a minimum of 5% of the time in February (mean 3 C) and a maximum of 27% of the time in August (mean 20 C; Erhorn 1988).Window-opening in an office building increased from 5% in December (mean 36 F) to 23% in April and October (mean 47-51 째F; Pallot 1962) . Windows were open <2% of the time at 30 째F all year (Pallot 1962) . When it was 50 째F outside, windows were open just 11% of the time in December, 21% of the time in October, and 29% of the time in April (Pallot 1962) . Thus, people tend to close the windows more in the colder seasons, even when it happens to be warm outside (Pallot 1962) .In an English school, window-opening was at a minimum of 14% in January, and a maximum of 85% in September (Davies 1987) .

As anyone who has burned something in the kitchen knows, the smoke can be cleared out much more quickly if windows are opened, as the ventilation increases. Indeed, studies show that window-opening can substantially improve indoor ventilation (Andersen 2009 ). The average household air-exchange rate can increase from 1.75 per hour at 33 째F to 3.25 per hour at 48 째F, largely due to window-opening behavior (Dick 1951) .With a wind speed of 2-4 m/s, air exchange can improve from about 1.2 hr-1 with windows closed to 4.0 hr-1 with 2 windows open (Mutch 1985) .Another study observed 0-0.5 air exchanges per hour with windows and doors closed, 9 to 15 air exchanges per hour with the window opened, and about 40 air exchanges per hour with both windows and window-doors opened (Heidt 1981) .Other studies in homes have found 0 to 0.1 air changes per hour with low window use, 0.1 to 0.5 air changes per hour with average window use, and 0.5 to 0.8 air changes per hour with high window use (Dubrul 1988) .Another study of two homes found baseline air exchange rates of 0.4 hr -1 , which increased by 0.1 to 2.8 hr -1 in one home and 0.5 to 1.7 hr -1 when windows were opened . Dick and colleagues (1951) estimated that typical households experienced 2 to 3 air exchanges per hour from opening windows. Air exchange rates also depend on wind speed (Dick 1951) . With 5 mph wind, and 4 vents open, 2.8 air exchanges per hour were observed (Dick 1951) .For some perspective, it should be noted that in Germany, required ventilation of 40 m 3 /h per person for living spaces corresponds with about 0.5 to 0.6 exchanges per hour (Heidt 1981) .In addition to window-opening, ventilation will be positively correlated with temperature because in non-air conditioned environments, fans are used more frequently at higher temperatures (Haldi 2008; Nicol 1999; Rijal 2008; Rijal 2013; Honnekeri 2014) , and doors are opened (Haldi 2008) .

Review of air conditioning.

The final stage in this progression is to have central heating and air conditioning. Eventually, the windows might be left closed all the time, the central system controls All rights reserved.

For instance, in one air-conditioned office building in Pakistan, occupants never opened the windows (Rijal 1988 ).In U.S. residences, the presence of central air-conditioning was associated with a lower likelihood of window opening than a window-unit, which was itself lower than in homes without air conditioning (Johnson 2005) .In a hospital, window-opening and air exchange regressions suggest that rooms would experience 1.6 air exchanges per hour at 35 째F, and 2.5 air exchanges per hour at 60 째F (Baird 1969) . Overall, winter conditions might see fresh air exchange rates of 0.5 per hour, compared with 2.0 exchanges per hour in summer (Baird 1969) . Full air conditioning might provide 7.5 air changes per hour (Baird 1969).In Korean homes, air conditioning was turned on at a temperature of 30 C, and turned off at a temperature of 26.9 C, in order to maintain the mean seasonal indoor temperature at 27.5 C (81.5 째F) (Bae 2009) . In Japan, some people began to turn on air conditioners at 25 C, but most people did so between 28 and 30 C (Habara 2013) . Another study in Japan found air conditioners turned on at an outdoor temperature of 30 C, in order to maintain the room at an average temperature of 29 C (Iwashita 1997) . Another study in Japan found that about half the residents had turned on the air conditioner at an indoor temperature of 27 C (Schweiker 2009) . In one study of airconditioned apartments in China, window opening frequency decreased above 24 C, and reached zero above 40 C (Shi 2016) . In the United States, somewhat cooler temperatures were set. In 5 U.S. states, the median air-conditioning activation temperature was 74.9 째F (23.8 C) (Haiad 2004 ).

Discussion.

Our study found that the association of Covid-19 mortality with outdoor temperature shows two peaks. The global maximum of Covid-19 mortality occurs close to freezing, while a local minimum in Covid-19 mortality is observed close to room temperature. The local minimum of Covid-19 mortality at room temperature likely relates to improved ventilation from window opening and less indoor crowding when it is comfortable outside. Below freezing, all windows are closed, and further cooling increases stack ventilation (secondary to indoor-outdoor temperature differences) and thereby decreases Covid-19 mortality. Opening windows and other tools for improving indoor ventilation may decrease the spread of Covid-19.It is important to understand that this analysis did not compare warm regions with cold regions. Rather, we compared warm weeks in one region with cold weeks in the same region. Because each area was compared with itself, regional variables such as population density, obesity and smoking prevalence, housing conditions, and willingness of the population to comply with mask wearing or restrictions on crowding were implicitly controlled for (to some degree).All rights reserved.

Outdoor humidity has been positively correlated with window opening (Brundrett 1977 , Jeong 2016 , Andersen 2017 ) and indoor air change rates (Du 2012) in some studies, but other studies have found that the association of humidity with window opening was negative Johnson & Long 2005 , Zhang 2012 , Jones 2017 , absent (Isaacs 2013), or multiphasic (Haldi 2009 , Shi 2016 ).Our study found that wind speed was negatively correlated with Covid-19 mortality. The association appeared somewhat smoother when effective wind speed was assumed to be zero in cold environments, to simulate the effect of window closure on the transmission of wind speed indoors. Indeed, wind speed has been positively correlated with indoor air change rates (Dick 1951) .The elevated Covid-19 mortality above room temperature might help to explain the higher mortality rates in the sunbelt of the United States in the summer of 2020. In addition, the elevated mortality rates observed in India in the spring of 2021 when the Delta variant began to predominate (Leffler 2021) . For instance, the hottest months for Hyderabad, India are May, April, and March, due to the cooling that occurs from the rainy summer season (climate-data.org).If the relationship between Covid-19 mortality and temperature had been a simple monotonic relationship, we might expect very high mortality in the coldest polar regions. The fact that mortality begins to decline at temperatures below freezing, presumably due to increased stack ventilation, might help to explain how many of the coldest Arctic regions, such as Iceland, Greenland, and some Scandinavian countries, have been able to avoid the highest levels of mortality.We thought that window closure in areas with a high household share of airconditioning might explain the second peak in Covid-19 mortality at temperatures above room temperature. However, this peak was present even in areas in which air conditioning was uncommon. There is some data that window opening may decrease a the very highest temperatures as occupants seek to protect themselves from the hot outdoor air (Herkel 2008) . As we noted above, air conditioning can sometimes actually increase the ventilation rates (Baird 1969). Our study compared Covid-19 mortality at different times within a region, rather than comparing rates between regions. Nonetheless, we do note that many Asian countries in which air conditioning is popular have had low mortality rates during the pandemic (Leffler 2020).These findings might have implications beyond Covid-19. It has been noted that influenza typically has a winter peak in temperate climates, but two annual peaks in the tropics (Ali 2021) . This observation was recently attributed to a U-shaped relationship between transmission and absolute humidity (Ali 2021) . Our findings and review would suggest that the association of environmental variables with indoor ventilation might be another fruitful avenue for investigation with respect to the incidence of respiratory disease.The findings imply that in areas entering the winter period, rates of Covid-19 mortality could increase in areas expected to cool in the range between room temperature and freezing. Subtropical regions which cool only to room temperature during the winter are at less risk. Of course, regional outcomes will be influenced by both natural and vaccine-acquired immunity, non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as mask-wearing (Leffler 2020) , and the flow of travelers from regions with different weather patterns.
