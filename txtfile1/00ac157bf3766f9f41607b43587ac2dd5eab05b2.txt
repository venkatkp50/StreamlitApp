Therefore, human cellular 81 systems are crucial to understand the many human and primate-specific properties of human 82 placenta. 83 84Human induced pluripotent stem cells are powerful models to understand causal genetic 85 mechanisms of human disease. For organs such as the brain, rapid progress has led to iPS 86 models with increasing complexity and utility (Mansour et al., 2020) . For the human placenta, 87 which is increasingly implicated as a risk factor for developmental disorders associated with a 88 maternal hyperimmune state, the ability to faithfully model human trophectoderm disease states 89 from human pluripotent stem cells is a matter of debate. Several model systems have been 90 developed to differentiate primed and naive iPSC to trophectoderm. Soon after the derivation of 91 the first human stem cells, Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4 (BMP4) was shown to differentiate 92 human stem cells to syncytial cytotrophoblasts (Xu et al., 2002) . Since then, various BMP4-93 based methods have been described including the BAP protocol (BMP4, A83-01 an alk-5 94inhibitor and PD173074 and FGF and VEGF inhibitor) ( Understanding if and how induced pluripotent stem cells can generate human trophectoderm is 116 central to understanding human pluripotent stem cell potency and the mechanisms regulating 117 human trophectoderm specification. In the present study, we first ask if BMP4 is required for 118 primed pluripotent stem cell specification to trophectoderm. In the absence of BMP4, we find 119 that activation of wingless/Integrated (Wnt) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) while inhibiting 120Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGFb) histone deacetylase (HDAC) and Rho-associated 121 protein kinase (ROCK) efficiently specify multiple primed pluripotent stem cell lines to 122 trophectoderm. These factors were previously discovered to derive and grow trophoblast stem 123 cells from blastocysts and the early placenta (Okae et al., 2018) . We demonstrate that iPS-124 derived TS cells are capable of self-renewal for at least 30 passages, differentiate into syncytial 125 cytotrophoblasts and villus cytotrophoblasts and generate villi-like structures in low oxygen. We 126 used temporal single-cell sequencing analysis to elucidate the transcriptional landscape of this 127 specification compared to previously implemented protocols involving BMP4. We find that BMP4 128 conditions alone largely generate extraembryonic mesoderm cells. BMP4 combined with 129 inhibition of WNT shifts differentiation away from a mesodermal fate while upregulating 130 trophoblast associated lineage markers but cells are transcriptionally distinct from ex vivo 131cytotrophoblasts. Trophoblast cells generated by TS conditions are transcriptionally highly 132 similar to ex vivo cytotrophoblasts and uniquely upregulate endogenous retroviral genes. 133Specification of primed iPS cells to TS occurs without entering a naive state and TFAP2A and 134ESRRG are central genes regulating the specification. Defining the molecular mechanisms 135 specifying the trophectoderm is key to understanding placental associated diseases and 136improving iPS-derived models. 137 138Results: 139 140

Derivation of trophoblast stem cells (TS) from primed human embryonic stem cells and 141

induced pluripotent stem cells without BMP4 142 143In search of alternative methods to specify iPS cells to trophectoderm, we reasoned that primed 144 human pluripotent stem cells might be capable of specification to trophoblast stem cells directly 145 by activating wingless/Integrated (WNT) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) and inhibiting 146Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGFb) histone deacetylase (HDAC) and Rho-associated 147 protein kinase (ROCK Figure 1A and B). 48 hours post passage, cells were switched directly to TSC media. By 156 brightfield imaging over the subsequent 6 days, we observed that cells proliferated rapidly and 157 adopted a flatter appearance with some cells adopting a cobblestone appearance ( Figure 1A -158 D). After passaging, two morphologically distinct populations emerged. Circular colonies with an 159 epithelial-like appearance could be seen surrounded by phase bright fibroblastic cells ( Figure  160 1E,F). The inner epithelial-like cells continued to proliferate and appeared morphologically 161 similar to TS cells derived from primary human embryos ( Figure 1G ). Immunofluorescence 162 revealed that subpopulations of the colony cells expressed TP63 and/or KRT7 and minimally 163 expressed VIM while surrounding fibroblastic cells strongly expressed VIM ( Figure 1H ). Over 164 the course of several passages, the epithelial-like cells preferentially expand and reach purity 165 between passage 5-7. These TSC widely express both TP63 and KRT7 ( Figure 1I -K, 166Supplemental Figure 1 ) without expressing the pluripotency genes SOX2 and NANOG 167 (Supplemental Figure 1 ). In summary, we find that activating wingless/Integrated (Wnt) and 168 epidermal growth factor (EGF) and inhibiting Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGFb) histone 169 deacetylase (HDAC) and Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) directly in primed iPS lines 170 results in efficient specification of trophoblast stem cells. 171 172Pluripotent stem cell lines vary in their propensity to differentiate to different cell types (Osafune 173 et al., 2008) . Therefore, we asked if TSC conditions without exogenous BMP4 could specify a 174 variety of primed human stem cell lines. We confirmed TS specification by VIM, KRT7 and TP63 175 immunofluorescence on iPS lines reprogrammed from dermal fibroblasts by sendai, named To confirm the ability to proliferate as TS-like cells, iPS-derived TS lines were passaged for up 179to 32 passages and maintained KRT7 and TP63 expression ( Figure 1K ). 180 181Hypoxia induces differentiation of iPS-derived TS cells into villi-like structures composed 182 of differentiated syncytial cytotrophoblasts and villus cytotrophoblasts 183 184To investigate the maturation potential of iPS-derived-TSC, we evaluated the ability of iPS-185 derived TS cells to differentiate to mature trophectoderm cell types. Proliferative trophoblast 186 stem cells are bipotential stem cells with the capacity to differentiate to syncytial 187 cytotrophoblasts and extravillous cytotrophoblasts (Okae et al 2018) . Syncytial cytotrophoblast 188 is a terminally differentiated multinucleated epithelial layer that infiltrates the maternal 189 endometrium. The multinucleated cell forms from multiple cytotrophoblast cell fusions. When TS 190 cells were grown to high density, we observed the spontaneous formation of multinucleated 191 cells by brightfield microscopy. We confirmed that multinucleated syncytial cells are negative nuclei surrounded by the tight-junction protein ZO-1 positive cells (Figure 2A and B). 193 We observed large areas of syncytial formation fused nuclei (Figure 2A and S3). 194Syncytiotrophoblasts produce and secrete high levels of human chorionic gonadotropin 195 (hCGB3), a hormone essential for cytotrophoblast differentiation, immuno-suppression, and 196 placental invasion (Cole, 2010) . We observe expression of hCGB3 in regions of the 197 differentiated cytotrophoblast cultures, indicating differentiation to syncytiotrophoblasts ( Figure  198 2C). Extravillus trophoblasts express human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G), the main molecule 199 involved in maternal immune system evasion upon placental invasion of the endometrium. We 200 also readily detected regions of HLA-G positive cells, indicating iPS-derived TS cells are 201 capable of differentiation to extravillous cytotrophoblast ( Figure 2D ). Expression of hCGB3 and 202HLA-G was specific to iPS-derived TS cells and not detected in iPS cells (Supplemental Figure  203 1I). 204 205To further induce differentiation of the iPS-derived-TSC, we tested if cells will respond to altering 206 oxygen concentrations. Hypoxia is a natural cue that stimulates syncytial cytotrophoblast 207 differentiation in vivo (Wakeland et al., 2017) , therefore we transitioned a high density TS cell 208 culture from atmospheric oxygen of 20% to 5%. In 5% oxygen, these cells demonstrate minimal 209 contact inhibition and form 3D villi-like structures that protrude from the monolayer surface of 210 the culture dish (Figure 2 E-H). When imaged by confocal microscopy, these villi-like structures  211  are approximately 50 microns in height. In summary, iPS-derived-TSC readily differentiate into  212  both HLA-G positive villus cytotrophoblasts and hCGB3 positive syncytial cytotrophoblasts.  213  214  Single cell RNA sequencing reveals unique transcriptional programs for iPS-derived TS  215  specification  216  217 To define the molecular events involved in the specification of iPS cells to trophectoderm, we 218 performed temporal single cell RNAseq analysis of human iPS cells specified to placental 219 trophoblast cells by three separate conditions: 1) addition of BMP4 (Xu et al., 2002) , 2) addition 220 of BMP4 and inhibition of Wnt with the small molecule inhibitor IWP2 (Horii et al., 2019) , 3) 221Trophoblast Stem Cell condition (TSC) activation of EGF and Wnt, inhibition of TGFbeta, HDAC 222and ROCK signaling to generate trophoblast stem cells ( Figure 3A ). Sequencing was generated 223for iPS cells before differentiation (day 0), for BMP4 on days 4 and 6, for BMP4+IWP2 on days 224 2, 4 and 6, and on days 2, 4, 6 and 8 for TS condition, resulting in 10 single-cell transcriptomes 225( Figure 3A ). In TS condition, the day 8 is a timepoint two days after the first passaging 226 annotated as p1. In the BMP4 and BMP4 + IWP2 conditions, no proliferative cells survived 227 passaging, therefore the p1 time point was not sequenced. Using the highly parallel droplet 228 based single cell sequencing method Drop-Seq (Macosko et al., 2015) , 9,821 high-quality cells 229were obtained after removing cells with less than 1000 genes detected and more than 20% of 230 mitochondrial mapping. The average ratio of mapping reads for mitochondrial genes in all cells 231were 3.9%, indicating good viability (Supplemental Figure 4A ). The total number of genes 232 detected ranged between 21804 for BMP4 + IWP2 day 4 to 27134 for TS day 4 (Supplemental 233 Figure 4B ) time point with between 563 to 1572 high quality cells per timepoint (Supplemental 234 Figure 4C ). 235 236In order to explore the data in an unbiased manner, we performed dimensionality reduction for Figure 3D , Table S1 ). 260 261To understand how transcriptional profiles change during the differentiation, we asked which 262 cells express canonical pluripotent, trophectoderm and mesoderm specific genes. We find that 263 the stem cell transcription factor SOX2 is highest expressed in the iPS stage and is absent from 264 the most differentiated BR, TS and SC clusters ( Figure 3E ). SOX2 expression is maintained at a 265 higher level in the initial days of the TS conditions compared to BMP WNTi and BMP treatment 266 and absent from the most differentiated TS cells. The Paired-like homeodomain transcription 267 factor 2 PITX2 is highly expressed in the later stages of BMP4 differentiation, suggesting that 268 BMP4 conditions generate placental stromal cells ( Figure 3F ). In single cell RNAseq of the 269 human placenta, PITX2 was identified as the top marker gene for a stromal fetal communicating initiated after blastocyst formation and has variable expression patterns in trophectoderm 283 (Niakan and Eggan, 2013) . Similar to TS cells derived from primary human embryos, CDX2 is 284 not expressed in the differentiated TS state, and there is sparse expression of CDX2 at d4 of all 285 differentiations ( Figure S5A ). 286 287Next we asked which genes are preferentially expressed in each cluster by non-parametric 288Wilcoxon rank sum test (adj.p-value < 0.05; logFC > 0.25)( Figure 3I , 320 al., 2014). We identified cell type specific genes that were preferentially expressed in each cell 321 type/cluster of the 19 clusters from iPS-derived cells by the specificity index probability (pSI) 322 statistic at thresholds of p< 0.05. Next, we tested whether cell-type specific genes previously 323identified by single cell studies of human placenta are over-represented in the cell-type specific 324 genes from our iPS specification by hypergeometric test and applied the Bonferroni correction 325 for multiple comparisons, considering all the tested gene lists [α = 0.05/ (19× (38+14)) = 5.1×10 -326 5 ]. Vento-Tormo identified a set of 38 cell types from maternal (decidua and blood) and fetal 327 tissues (placenta) of first trimester placenta and reported 30 cell-type specific genes per cell 328 type (Vento-Tormo et al., 2018). We found that the transcriptional profile from all iPS clusters 329 and clusters from d2-d4 timepoints did not have significant enrichment for any of the placental 330 cell type clusters ( Figure S6A ). In contrast, the most mature iPS-derived TS cluster was highly 331 enriched for the syncytial cytotrophoblast (SCT) and villous cytotrophoblast (VCT) cluster 332 (p=log10 -32 and log10 -17 ) ( Figure 4A ). The expression profile of the iPS-derived TS cluster was 333 highly specific for SCT and VCT with no significant enrichment for any other cell-type in the 334 maternal fetal interface. The D6 BMP4 cluster SC was most enriched in the two fibroblast 335 clusters (F1 and F2) (p=log10 -26 and p=log10 -13 ). Vento-Tormo described these placental 336 fibroblasts as mesenchymal stromal cells of fetal origin that derive from the primitive endoderm 337 expressing GATA4, GATA6, PDGFRa, and SOX17 ( Figure S6 and S7). The BMP4 + IWP2 338 conditions (BR) were not strongly enriched for any specific placental cell type and instead had 339weaker enrichment for several clusters including syncytial cytotrophoblast (SCT), and maternal 340 decidua derived F1 endodermal cell type and dS1. In sum, iPS-derived TS cells are highly 341 enriched for expression of genes specific to syncytial cytotrophoblast and villous cytotrophoblast 342 of ex vivo human placenta. 343 344Next we compared the expression profiles to early placental dataset from the 8 week and 24 345week placenta (Liu et al., 2018) ( Figure 4B ). Again, we found strong enrichment for the iPS-346 derived TS cells in the eight week fusion competent CTB1 (cytotrophoblast, log10 -9 ). BMP4 alone 347and Figure S7B ), we confirmed that TS cells expressed the highest level of cytotrophoblast 360and EVT specific genes. In summary, iPS cells specified via TS conditions have a 361 transcriptional profile highly homologous to cytotrophoblasts taken directly from human placenta 362 while BMP4 differentiation generates placental mesenchymal cells. 363 364Primed iPS specify to trophoblast by activation of TFAP2A without activation of naive 365 stem cell programs 366 367It has been reported that primed stem cells are restricted in their potency and unable to 368 differentiate to TSC while naive stem cells readily differentiate to TSC because they are poised 369 to specify to trophectoderm (Dong et al., 2020) . Therefore, we asked if the primed iPS or TSCM 370 treated cells adopt a naive stem cell program during differentiation. For 12 previously identified 371 naive marker genes (Messmer et al., 2019), naive transcripts were nearly absent. Five genes 372 HORMAD1, ALPPL2, KHD3L, TRIM60, and HYAL4 had no observed expression in any cell 373 ( Figure 5A , To identify the most significant gene expression changes associated with the initial stages of TS 392 specification, we studied a subset of the sample using only cells from the iPS and TS day 2 393 samples and applied a single-cell trajectory inference and pseudotime estimation (STREAM) to 394 the single cell transcriptome data (Chen et al., 2019) . Briefly, single cells were ordered along 395 probabilistic trajectories and a numeric value referred to as pseudotime was assigned to each 396cell to indicate how far it progresses along the dynamic differentiation. STREAM identifies an 397 initial branch composed of both iPS and TS day2 cells (S3-S0). This level of analysis also 398 identified branches containing IPS cells (S0-S2, S0-S4), reflecting the pluripotency continuum, 399as well as a TS day 2 (S0-S1) branch reflecting the exit from pluripotency ( Figure 5C and Table  400 S5). On branch S3-S0, node S3 was predominantly composed of iPS cells while TS day 2 cells 401 are more abundant towards S0 ( Figure 5C , S8A,B). We next identified the transcriptional states 402 that contribute to the specification by identifying highly expressed genes within a branch that are were expressed not only along branch S3-S0 but also along branch S0-S1 ( Figure S8C ). The 411branch S0-S1 captures the transition out of the pluripotent state and into the TS state with 412 upregulation of cytokeratins (KRT18, KRT19, KRT8) and calcium binding proteins (S100A11, 413 S100A10) known to be expressed in trophectoderm To understand the transcriptional changes associated with the full trajectory of iPS to 425 trophectoderm specification, we repeated the STREAM analysis with the complete iPS to d8 426 dataset. STREAM identifies 4 main branching points among all single cells ( Figure 6A ). The 427 early differentiation days for all conditions were mixed in pseudotime demonstrating a similar 428 transcriptional state at the initial phases of IPS commitment when compared in the context of d6 429 and d8 cells. Similar to the UMAP projection ( Figure 3B ,C), STREAM inferred mixing of two iPS 430 stages with cells from the d2 treatments. STREAM inferred three main branching points which 431 separated based on the most differentiated cells from each condition. To reveal the 432 transcriptional states that contribute to the branching, we carried out differential expression 433 analysis to identify highly expressed genes within a branch that are differentially expressed 434 compared to all other branches, termed leaf gene detection analysis in STREAM (see methods) 435( Figure 6B , Table S6 ). For the zero IPS branch point, pluripotent-specific genes including 436DNMT3A and POU5F1/OCT4 were highly differentially expressed. For the branch of cells 437 exposed to BMP4 (SC), mesoderm markers including PITX2 were identified as differentially 438expressed. For the BMP+IWP2 branch, placental associated genes were identified including 439RAB31, a small GTPases highly expressed in placenta that regulates intracellular membrane 440trafficking of ligand bound EGFR (Chua and Tang, 2014) . For the TS branch, significantly 441 differentially expressed genes were associated with trophectoderm commitment and 442implantation and preeclampsia including GATA3. We performed a Gene Ontology enrichment 443 analysis for biological processes using the top 300 significantly differentially expressed leaf 444 genes for the TS branch. Significantly overrepresented GO categories included placental 445 development, female pregnancy, viral processes (Figure 6 C,D). 446 447Human endogenous retrovirus derived genes participate in a regulatory subnetwork 448 specifically within iPS-derived trophoblast stem cells 449 450We found the set of genes involved in viral-like processes are upregulated in the later TS 451 differentiation timepoints ( Figure 6C ). This echoes an increasing body of evidence 452 demonstrating that endogenous retroviruses play a fundamental role in the evolutionary 453 diversification of the mammalian placenta (Johnson, 2019) . Therefore, we asked what is the 454 expression of human ERV-derived genes during trophectoderm specification? We found specific 455 upregulation of five ERV-derived genes in the most differentiated TS cell type ( Figure 7A ). 456 457To understand the place of ERV-derived genes in the regulatory TS regulatory network, we 458analyzed the participation of ERV-derived genes in a gene regulatory network. We built a 459 transcription factor and target gene network model using the Passing Attributes between 460Networks for Data Assimilation (PANDA) algorithm to all clusters among the conditions. PANDA 461integrates information from TF-sequence-motif data, gene expression and protein-protein 462 interaction (PPI) in a message-passing approach (Glass et al., 2013) . Briefly, PANDA's 463 algorithm makes the assumption that genes targeted by the same TF are more likely to be co-464 expressed than genes that are regulated by a different TF. Using a TF-sequence motif as initial 465 network model, the algorithm refines and updates the model by computing the congruence 466 between two measures: 1) Concordance in co-expression of genes presenting motif for a same 467 TF, and 2) Concordance in the regulatory profile of a set of TFs that interact with each other via 468Protein-protein interaction data. Therefore, the likelihood of interaction between a TF and a 469 target gene is given by its edge weight, which states for the coordination of targets' expression 470by a TF complex. PANDA outputs Z-score normalized edge weights, therefore positive and 471negative weights can be seen as likely and unlikely interactions respectively. One network was 472 created for each previously identified cell cluster based on the expression profile of the top 100 473 cells in each cluster (based on PC1) with genes expressed in at least 10% cells. 474 We found that ERV interactions (Transcription Factors + ERV-derived genes) are prominent in 475 the most differentiated TS cluster and in no other cell clusters. We found regulatory interactions 476 for five ERV-derived genes (ERVH48-1, ERV3-1, ERVMER34-1, ERVW-1 and ERVFRD-1) are 477 highly unique to the TS cluster network, while only 0 or 1 ERV-derived gene was found in the 478 other cell clusters ( Figure 7B, S9A) . Clusters SC and SC 3 (BMP4 cells) exhibited interactions 479for gene ERVH48-1, and clusters BR 1, BR 3 and BR 4 (BMP4+IWP2 cells) presented the gene 480ERV3-1. Interestingly, genes encompassed in ERV regulatory interactions of iPS derived TS 481 cells were enriched in biological pathways related to hormone metabolism, cell differentiation 482 and the immune system (adj. p value < 0.01) ( Figure 7C , Table S7 ). In addition, we observed 483 ERV regulatory interactions are also enriched for categories such as placenta development, 484trophectodermal cell differentiation and syncytium formation ( Figure 8A , Table S8)  519 and putative alternative entry receptors BSG, HSPA5 and DPP4 are more expressed. Other 520 potential entry proteases CTSB, CTSL and FURIN are all expressed at a higher level ( Figure  521 8B, Table S8 ). The placenta also protects the fetus from infection by the active transfer of 522 maternal antibodies to the fetus. Syncytiotrophoblasts transfer protective humoral maternal IgG 523to the fetus via the neonatal Fc receptor encoded by the FCGRT gene (Leach et al., 1996) representation of the pseudotime with the clusters Figure S9 and C.

Human ES and iPS were maintained on coated plates in Stemflex media. 740Media was changed every 48hrs in accordance with manufacturer recommendations. Cells 741were passaged in small clusters using Versene solution and a split ratio of 1:10-1:12. For 742 cryopreservation, cells were suspended in PSC media and temporarily stored in a deep freezer 743 at −80°C before being transferred to liquid nitrogen for long term storage. 744 745Differentiations and Cell Maintenance 746 6-well plates were coated with reduced growth factor Cultrex (1mg/12 ml DMEM/F12) at 37°C 747 for at least one hour. PSC were harvested in small clusters using Versene solution without 748centrifugation, seeded at a passage ratio of 1:12, and cultured in 2 mL of Stemflex medium. 749After 24 hours, cells were washed with DPBS and 2 mL of appropriate media was added to 750 each differentiating well. For TS differentiation, TS medium [DMEM/F12 with Glutamax 751 supplemented with 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% FBS, 0.3% BSA, 1% ITS-X supplement, 7521.5 μg/ml L-ascorbic acid, 50 ng/ml EGF, 2 μM CHIR99021, 0.5 μM A83-01, 1 μM SB431542, 753 0.8 mM VPA and 5 μM Y27632] was added to each well. For BMP4 based differentiations 10 754 ng/ml BMP4 and/or 2uM IWP2 was added to basal differentiation medium (DMEM/F12 with 755Glutamax supplemented with ITS and L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate magnesium) was added to 756 each well. Every 24 hours 2 mL of fresh medium was added to each well. Cells were collected 757 on day 2, 4, and 6 for RNA sequencing. For the TS condition, after 6 days of differentiation cells 758were passaged using TrypLE express at a split ratio of 1:3 and plated on new Cultrex or col IV 759(5 ug/mL) coated plates. After the first passage, cells were fed every 48 hours and split at a ratio 760 of 1:3- Preprocessing of Drop-seq data 828Raw sequencing data was preprocessed using the pipeline "Drop-seq Alignment Cookbook" 829 v2.0.0 found at https://github.com/broadinstitute/Drop-seq/releases/ and described in (Macosko 830 et al., 2015) . Briefly, paired-end reads were filtered in order to remove read pairs with any base 831 with quality of less than 10 in both cellular and molecular barcodes. SMART adapters at 5' end 832 and polyA tails at 3' end with 6 or more bp were removed from the second pair, and then 833 aligned to the reference human (GRCh38) genome using HISAT2 v2. To profile the expression patterns of the 19 clusters detected in this work, we applied the Cell-894Specific Expression Analysis (CSEA) as implemented in the pSI R package (Xu et al., 2014) . 895This approach compares each profile with all the others and identifies genes expressed in one 896 group but not in the others, calculates a score (specificity index, SI) for each gene and attributes 897 a statistical level of significance (pSI). Here, we used the normalized expression matrix to 898 compute cluster-level median gene expression for each gene, which defined 19 cluster profiles. 899Then, cluster profiles were used to compute SI and pSI for each gene, within each profile. 900Cluster-specific gene lists were obtained applying the statistical threshold, pSI < 0.05. 901 902Finally, we tested whether cell-specific genes from previous studies are over-represented in our 903 clusters. We used the hypergeometric test and applied the Bonferroni correction for multiple 904comparisons, considering all the tested gene lists [α = 0.05/ (19× (38+14)) = 5.1×10 -5 ]. 905 906PANDA regulatory networks 907Gene regulatory networks were constructed using the pandaR v1.14.0 R package which 908integrates multiple types of data to infer direct interactions (edges) between TFs and target 909genes. PANDA initiates with a prior regulatory network that can be built by mapping TF binding 910 sites to the genome, and refines this initial network integrating gene expression data of target 911 genes and TF PPI data. The main idea behind the algorithm is that target genes from a given 912 TF are likely co-expressed, and TFs that interact with each other are more likely to regulate a 913 similar group of target genes. These two assumptions are used to infer the edge weight of each 914 TF-target interaction, and basically reflects the congruence between the regulatory profile of a 915 TF with target gene co-expression. Iteratively the algorithm refine the initial network structure 916 and infer a final consensus regulatory network. 917A regulatory network was built for each cluster using as initial network a TF-motif binding map 918 described in (Sonawane et al., 2017) and downloaded in 919 (https://sites.google.com/a/channing.harvard.edu/kimberlyglass/tools/resources). Gene 920 expression data was library size normalized, scaled, and natural-log transformed. Genes 921 expressed in less than 10% of the cells of each cluster were filtered out. PPI network of TFs 922 was built using STRING database v11.0 (downloaded from https://string-db.org/) and score 923 interactions were divided by 1000 to initiate the PANDA. 924Edges with negative weights estimated by PANDA were discarded in order to explore only 925interactions with greater evidence.
