(7) PwMND also experience other forms of emotional distress besides anxiety and depression including feelings of hopelessness (8) (9) (10) and demoralization. (2) Emotions are also affected by low self-esteem, (4, 11) end of life concerns, (8) faith/existential concerns, (12, 13) sense of loss, (13, 14) and changes in identity, roles and relationships. (11, 13, 15) Qualitative research on experiences of living with MND has also described the impact of the significant losses that come with MND on personal, social and occupational relationships. (10) Family members or caregivers of pwMND often struggle with the emotional impact and burden of the disease, and have high rates of psychological morbidity. (16) (17) (18) Qualitative studies with caregivers have described the strain from caring tasks, from having to make changes to their own lives and not having time for themselves. (19) (20) (21) In terms of wellbeing, psychosocial factors like coping strategies and social support, are more strongly related to wellbeing and quality of life than demographic and clinical factors. (11, 22, 23) There have however, been few effective psychological interventions to improve psychological wellbeing,(24) and more research and interventions are needed. potential factors that may impact distress or wellbeing. One study examined the use of metaphors to express emotions, (25) and a small number have focused on emotions at specific time periods (e.g. during diagnosis or the final stages). (6, 14, 26) It is also important to understand the experiences of emotions and coping among people whose experiences are not yet well represented in research, especially people with speech difficulties, cognitive impairment, and people at different stages of the disease. 

Participants

Participants were 25 pwMND and 10 family caregivers, purposively sampled to include people with varying types and severity of symptoms, and time since diagnosis (see Table 1 ).Participants were above 18 years of age, had an MND diagnosis, and had mental capacity to consider participation in the study. We included participants who self-reported difficulties with cognition, but had mental capacity to give informed consent, as the views of pwMND who have cognitive impairment have been underrepresented in previous research. We included caregivers above 18 years of age, both current and recently bereaved (bereavement within 1 year from the time of the interview). 

Data analysis

Face-to-face and phone interviews were audio recorded and transcribed, and all interviews were anonymized. Data were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis,(29, 30) as this was a flexible method that suited the research question, helped us identify common patterns across participants' experiences and allowed us to look for underlying meaning behind experiences of emotional distress and wellbeing. The analysis was mainly conducted by CP, a PhD codes about emotional distress and emotional wellbeing were grouped together and candidate themes were generated. Themes were then reviewed to see if they represented experiences across the dataset. Theme names were revised and findings written up; this was also an iterative process whereby descriptions were clarified and overlap between themes identified.CP had regular meetings with qualitative research experts LD and AG who helped refine codes and themes.

Ethics

We obtained ethics from the University of Southampton ethics committee (ERGOII-46996).Written informed consent was obtained for all participants. Participants were debriefed and steps were taken following each interview to ensure participants were not distressed.

Patient and Public Involvement (PPI)

Three PPI members (one person with MND and 2 former caregivers) contributed to this study. They were involved in the recruitment stage to help the researcher identify potential participants from local groups. PPI members also contributed to piloting the interview topic guide, refining interview questions and trialling the data collection procedure to ensure that it was not burdensome. Some PPI members also looked over the early drafts of the findings and offered insight about elements to highlight or discuss in the reporting of the results. 

RESULTS

We developed 8 themes and 20 subthemes. The first four themes relate to triggers of emotional distress (Fig 1) ; the remaining four themes capture strategies to improve emotional wellbeing (Fig 2) . All themes were present in some degree and form in both patient and caregiver interviews; where differences between these groups were apparent, they are described.[Insert Fig 1 here] 3 Participants were 25 pwMND and 10 family caregivers (see Table 1 ).4 29 interviews were conducted in total; 6 joint interviews and 23 one-to-one interviews with 5 either pwMND or caregiver . 14 interviews were conducted face-to-face, 8 via telephone, and 6 7 via email.

Triggers of emotional distress

Participants described 4 main triggers of emotional distress and how they had an impact on emotions (themes are numbered, subthemes in italics).(1) Losing function or abilityMost participants described how losing function or ability was distressing because of a reduced sense of autonomy and control. PwMND spoke about feelings of anger, frustration, sadness or grief at not being able to do the things they wanted to, at losing their independence and relying on others for help. Similarly, caregivers expressed sadness at seeing their family member lose capability and independence. ...and seeing him, and it saddened me, where you're sort of doing the job of hoisting and moving, the manual handling, and then you step back and you're seeing it from a distance, that's actually quite [pauses] hard as well, because he's got no control over his body and he's having to have people do that for him." (Caregiver, C05)Losing function led to changes in identity, specifically those of becoming a 'patient' and 'carer'. These changes, especially losing one's voice which is strongly linked to identity, were experienced as distressing. "But I'm having to accept I might have a lonely old age. Disappointment, more than anything else.' (Caregiver, C27)Participants also described emotional distress when anticipating future symptoms or disease 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 emotional wellbeing and MND is the importance of self-kindness and self-care. Selfcompassion has been associated with adaptive coping strategies and wellbeing other chronic illnesses (43) (44) (45) and similar approaches may be useful for pwMND and their caregivers.

Strengths and Limitations

We aimed to recruit a diverse range of participants and succeeded in sampling people with different symptoms of varying severities, particularly people with difficulties speaking.However, we did not manage to recruit many people with mild cognitive impairment.Although we captured the experiences of newly diagnosed people and people who had MND for several years, we could not ascertain if we captured the experiences of people who were at the end stages. Distress and coping strategies used by these groups may be very different and findings need to be applied bearing this in mind.
